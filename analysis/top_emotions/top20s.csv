So, the question is, can we allow people to go on this trajectory where more and more of their paycheck is getting eaten up in a plan that&amp;#39;s, frankly, not giving them choice, doctors, or plans that they want?

It means that you have a check, and I think what we&amp;#39;ve seen over the last few years with Obamacare is you can have an insurance card, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean someone&amp;#39;s going to take it, and it sure doesn&amp;#39;t mean that it&amp;#39;s going to be affordable.

While in Germany, Ivanka will also visit a school for an interactive tour and discussion with students participating in the apprentice program. In commemoration of Holocaust Remembrance Day, she will visit the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin. A readout of the President&amp;#39;s and Chancellor Merkel&amp;#39;s call should be out already. Following that call, the President spoke with Dr. Peggy Whitson, the commander of the International Space Station via video teleconference. As I told you guys last week, Dr. Whitson, who is on her third extended stay aboard the International Space Station, breaks the record for the most space time of any American astronaut. The President was honored to celebrate this incredible achievement by Dr. Whitson and the American space program,",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

After that, as I mentioned at the top, the President had a working lunch with U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and the other ambassadors of the countries that are part of the U.N. Security Council. Under the President&amp;#39;s leadership, America has once again taken a leadership role on the world stage, and our global partners have welcomed this renewal of American diplomacy. Later on, this afternoon, the President will sign a proclamation on Holocaust Remembrance Day, part of the weeklong Days of Remembrance first held in 1979, and later established by Congress as our nation&amp;#39;s commemoration of the Holocaust. Tomorrow, as every President since the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum opened in 1993, President Trump will participate in a Days of Remembrance commemoration.",FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Mr. Spicer: I think that the President said that he&amp;#39;s going to -- The Press: Is it possible, mathematically? Mr. Spicer: There&amp;#39;s a lot of things that are possible, but let&amp;#39;s let the President -- he made a commitment to get it out on Wednesday, so let&amp;#39;s be patient and wait until Wednesday. The Press: And just one more. Mr. Spicer: Of course. (Laughter.) The Press: Is there a plan for infrastructure reform in the works? Will we get that before -- Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s another thing that&amp;#39;s on the list, but I think we seem to have our hands full right now with healthcare and tax reform. He&amp;#39;s obviously still committed to seeing infrastructure, something he&amp;#39;s talked about a lot in terms of roads and bridges and rebuilding things. But let&amp;#39;s get these first two things moving. But I think you&amp;#39;re going to see a continued commitment to infrastructure as well. The Press: It&amp;#39;s one of the things that could potentially have bipartisan support. Is there urgency to get infrastructure reform passed? Mr. Spicer: (Laughter.) So, either we&amp;#39;re doing too much or we&amp;#39;re not doing enough. But I think -- look, he has made it very clear that that is a priority of his.
