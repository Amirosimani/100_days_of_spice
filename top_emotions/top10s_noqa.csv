I was going to start of a little recap of the inauguration, but I think we&amp;#39;ve covered that pretty well. By the way, just as I get started, I know that Josh Earnest was voted the Most Popular Press Secretary by the Press Corp, so after reading and checking my Twitter feed, I shot Josh an e-mail last night letting him know that he can rest easy that his title is secure for at least the next few days.

He spoke by phone with Governor Deal of Georgia yesterday and offered his condolences and support.

And then on Friday he will do the same for Secretary Mattis at the Department of Defense.

In addition to these productive meetings, the president also took major steps towards fulfilling some of his biggest campaign promises to the American people. He ushered in a new era of U.S. trade policy by withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement and restored respect for taxpayers by instituting a hiring freeze on the executive branch. He also re-affirmed his commitment to life by re-establishing the Mexico City policy.
