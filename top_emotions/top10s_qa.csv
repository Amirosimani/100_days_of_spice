So we&amp;#39;re pleased that this one was able to come together, and then we&amp;#39;ll get to the next one. The Press: My last question. Mr. Spicer: Yes. The Press: Yesterday there was a compare-and-contrast with visuals, show and tell if you will -- Mr. Spicer: Yes, I saw that -- The Press: Yes, you were -- yes.

The Press: Americans are filling out their tax forms right now for 2016. This time, next year, they&amp;#39;re going to fill it out for 2017. Will they have a 2017 tax cut this time next year? Mr. Spicer: I think middle-income Americans I hope have a tax cut by then. Jeff. The Press: Sean, during the campaign -- Mr. Spicer: Sorry, it&amp;#39;s -- The Press: Sorry. You can go next.
