<text start="0" dur="2.035">Mr. Spicer: Good afternoon, everybody.</text>
<text start="2.035" dur="0.867">Thanks for coming.</text>
<text start="2.902" dur="3.771">Last night, the President was honored to announce</text>
<text start="6.673" dur="3.103">Judge Neil Gorsuch as his nominee to serve as the</text>
<text start="9.776" dur="1.501">next Justice of the Supreme Court.</text>
<text start="11.277" dur="2.97">It was an unbelievably phenomenal evening.</text>
<text start="14.247" dur="2.402">Immediately after being announced, Judge Gorsuch</text>
<text start="16.649" dur="2.937">
was honored to meet with Maureen and Father Scalia.
</text>
<text start="19.586" dur="2.569">As some of you have reported, his first call</text>
<text start="22.155" dur="2.269">after coming back behind the podium was to Merritt</text>
<text start="24.424" dur="2.536">Garland who had also note, has already come out to</text>
<text start="26.96" dur="2.669">say Judge Gorsuch deserves a fair hearing.</text>
<text start="29.629" dur="2.803">In less than 24 hours, Judge Gorsuch has already</text>
<text start="32.432" dur="2.269">received a wide-spread praise from across the</text>
<text start="34.701" dur="3.036">political spectrum as an inspired choice with</text>
<text start="37.737" dur="3.237">sterling academic credentials; a brilliant</text>
<text start="40.974" dur="3.336">legal mind; and, a steadfast commitment to</text>
<text start="44.31" dur="2.203">constitutional principles.</text>
<text start="46.513" dur="2.669">During his long career in public service, Judge</text>
<text start="49.182" dur="2.536">Gorsuch has enjoyed bipartisan approval,</text>
<text start="51.718" dur="2.302">having previously been confirmed by voice</text>
<text start="54.02" dur="1.402">vote to the U.S.</text>
<text start="55.422" dur="3.203">Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit.</text>
<text start="58.625" dur="2.803">In fact, 12 current Democratic senators,</text>
<text start="61.428" dur="2.535">including Minority Leader, Chuck Schumer, Senator</text>
<text start="63.963" dur="3.337">Dianne Feinstein, Senator Leahy were all in office</text>
<text start="67.3" dur="2.102">when he was first confirmed without</text>
<text start="69.402" dur="2.636">opposition in 2006.</text>
<text start="72.038" dur="2.202">With as many as eight Democrats like, Senator</text>
<text start="74.24" dur="2.336">Blumenthal, Durbin, McCaskill, already</text>
<text start="76.576" dur="2.236">supporting a full hearing and vote for Judge</text>
<text start="78.812" dur="2.502">Gorsuch, there is no question that he is a</text>
<text start="81.314" dur="2.87">widely respected jurist who deserves to have his</text>
<text start="84.184" dur="2.502">nomination fairly decided upon by the</text>
<text start="86.686" dur="1.468">United States Senate.</text>
<text start="88.154" dur="2.569">
Now that Judge Gorsuch has been officially named, I
</text>
<text start="90.723" dur="1.602">
hope you all will allow me to talk for a moment about
</text>
<text start="92.325" dur="2.636">how exceptionally qualified he is to succeed</text>
<text start="94.961" dur="2.836">the late, great, Antonin Scalia.</text>
<text start="97.797" dur="2.77">
Judge Gorsuch&#39;s academic record is impeccable and
</text>
<text start="100.567" dur="2.435">
as he said last night, the President holds education
</text>
<text start="103.002" dur="1.702">in the highest regard.</text>
<text start="104.704" dur="3.504">Judge Gorsuch graduated kappa-be -- phi kappa beta</text>
<text start="108.208" dur="3.003">
from Columbia; graduated cum laude from Harvard Law
</text>
<text start="111.211" dur="2.702">School and attended Oxford as a recipient of the</text>
<text start="113.913" dur="3.003">prestigious Marshall Scholarship.</text>
<text start="116.916" dur="2.636">Like Justice Scalia, the cornerstone of Judge</text>
<text start="119.552" dur="2.236">Gorsuch&#39;s judicial philosophy is fidelity</text>
<text start="121.788" dur="1.234">to the text.</text>
<text start="123.022" dur="2.002">He believes that judges should not base their</text>
<text start="125.024" dur="1.335">decisions solely on the law -- he believes --</text>
<text start="126.359" dur="1.335">
sorry, I don&#39;t want to screw that one up -- that
</text>
<text start="127.694" dur="1.368">his decisions should be based solely on the law</text>
<text start="129.062" dur="4.971">and the Constitution, not on their own policies,</text>
<text start="136.135" dur="1.635">preferences or personal feelings.</text>
<text start="137.77" dur="2.603">He will be a reliable and principled voice on the</text>
<text start="140.373" dur="3.07">bench, preserving equal justice under the law</text>
<text start="143.443" dur="1.435">regardless of background.</text>
<text start="144.878" dur="2.736">
And I would note, I think -- I always want to caveat
</text>
<text start="147.614" dur="1.868">this, but to my understanding, I think he</text>
<text start="149.482" dur="3.837">
would be the first justice that will serve with a --
</text>
<text start="153.319" dur="3.304">
with the -- as someone he clerked for on the bench.
</text>
<text start="156.623" dur="2.936">
So, it will be a sort -- a first when he is confirmed
</text>
<text start="159.559" dur="1.134">by the Senate.</text>
<text start="160.693" dur="2.503">Now, on to the issues of the day -- today is</text>
<text start="163.196" dur="2.369">February 1st, which means we are kicking off Black</text>
<text start="165.565" dur="1.168">History Month.</text>
<text start="166.733" dur="1.601">The President has events planned throughout the</text>
<text start="168.334" dur="3.804">month starting today with a listening session that</text>
<text start="172.138" dur="1.869">occurred early this morning with African</text>
<text start="174.007" dur="1.968">American leaders in the Roosevelt Room.</text>
<text start="175.975" dur="1.335">The meeting also included some of the</text>
<text start="177.31" dur="2.803">Administration&#39;s African American appointees.</text>
<text start="180.113" dur="1.168">Later today, the President</text>
<text start="181.281" dur="2.836">will issue a proclamation. The U.S.</text>
<text start="184.117" dur="2.002">Postal Service kicked off the month by issuing the</text>
<text start="186.119" dur="2.936">Dorothy Height Forever Stamp, the 40th stamp in</text>
<text start="189.055" dur="1.969">their black heritage series.</text>
<text start="191.024" dur="2.536">Dr. Height led the National Council of Negro</text>
<text start="193.56" dur="3.103">Women for four decades and was awarded the</text>
<text start="196.663" dur="2.269">Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill</text>
<text start="198.932" dur="3.069">Clinton in 1994 and the Congressional Medal of</text>
<text start="202.001" dur="2.169">Freedom by President George W.</text>
<text start="204.17" dur="3.37">Bush in 2004 -- excuse me, 1994 and 2004.</text>
<text start="207.54" dur="3.103">President Obama delivered her eulogy in 2010, and</text>
<text start="210.643" dur="2.002">President Trump is now proud that the Post Office</text>
<text start="212.645" dur="2.469">is honoring her incredible legacy as a</text>
<text start="215.114" dur="1.836">Civil Rights icon.</text>
<text start="216.95" dur="1.968">At events throughout this entire month, we&#39;ll</text>
<text start="218.918" dur="1.535">celebrate the contributions of</text>
<text start="220.453" dur="1.902">courageous African American leaders from</text>
<text start="222.355" dur="2.069">Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass to</text>
<text start="224.424" dur="3.136">Martin Luther King, Jr. and Clarence Thomas.</text>
<text start="227.56" dur="2.669">African American History is American History, and</text>
<text start="230.229" dur="2.503">this month is a great reminder of that.</text>
<text start="232.732" dur="1.902">Continuing with today&#39;s schedule, the Vice</text>
<text start="234.634" dur="2.602">
President went to the Hill with Judge Gorsuch to meet
</text>
<text start="237.236" dur="2.837">with lawmakers from the first time since being</text>
<text start="240.073" dur="1.301">named last night.</text>
<text start="241.374" dur="2.936">On the Hill, the Vice President will -- met with</text>
<text start="244.31" dur="2.503">
Majority Leader McConnell and the staff spearheading
</text>
<text start="246.813" dur="1.868">Judge Gorsuch&#39;s nomination will also meet with</text>
<text start="248.681" dur="3.437">Senators Cornyn, Grassley, Hatch and Gardener.</text>
<text start="252.118" dur="2.169">
With Judge Gorsuch on Capitol Hill, I think it&#39;s
</text>
<text start="254.287" dur="2.636">
a good time to talk about the confirmation process.
</text>
<text start="256.923" dur="1.902">Neither of the two Supreme Court Justices that</text>
<text start="258.825" dur="2.302">President Obama nominated were subject to the</text>
<text start="261.127" dur="2.503">60-vote threshold of the Senate filibuster.</text>
<text start="263.63" dur="1.835">They received bipartisan support because</text>
<text start="265.465" dur="2.502">Republicans, despite some political and</text>
<text start="267.967" dur="2.169">philosophical differences, viewed them as</text>
<text start="270.136" dur="1.702">mainstream and qualified.</text>
<text start="271.838" dur="1.468">And Judge Gorsuch shall</text>
<text start="273.306" dur="2.469">receive the same fair treatment.</text>
<text start="275.775" dur="1.835">Also, this morning, the President met in the</text>
<text start="277.61" dur="2.202">Roosevelt Room with representatives of outside</text>
<text start="279.812" dur="2.536">groups to discuss Judge Gorsuch&#39;s nomination,</text>
<text start="282.348" dur="2.269">
including David O&#39;Steen of the National Right to
</text>
<text start="284.617" dur="2.936">Life; Paula White of the New Destiny Christian</text>
<text start="287.553" dur="2.303">Center; Wayne LaPierre of the National Rifle</text>

<text start="292.592" dur="3.27">America; Charmaine Yoest of American Values;</text>
<text start="295.862" dur="1.902">Juanita Duggan of the National Federation of</text>
<text start="297.764" dur="2.369">Independent Businesses; Tom Collimore of the</text>
<text start="300.133" dur="2.669">United States Chamber of Commerce; Grover Norquist</text>
<text start="302.802" dur="2.87">of Americans for Tax Reform; Leonard Leo of the</text>
<text start="305.672" dur="2.502">Federalists Society; Marjorie Dannenfelser of</text>
<text start="308.174" dur="0.667">the Susan B.</text>
<text start="308.841" dur="2.036">Anthony List; and, Morton Blackwell of the</text>
<text start="310.877" dur="1.568">Leadership Institute.</text>
<text start="312.445" dur="2.369">
President Trump told the group that his decision on
</text>
<text start="314.814" dur="2.336">the Supreme Court is among the most important</text>
<text start="317.15" dur="2.135">decisions he will ever make as president.</text>
<text start="319.285" dur="2.069">He praised Judge Gorsuch for his academic and</text>
<text start="321.354" dur="2.169">professional achievements and his lifelong</text>
<text start="323.523" dur="2.402">devotion to the law.</text>
<text start="325.925" dur="1.869">
The attendees thanked the President for making such
</text>
<text start="327.794" dur="2.269">
an inspired choice and for delivering what was, for
</text>
<text start="330.063" dur="3.169">many of them, their number issue in the campaign.</text>
<text start="333.232" dur="2.603">They committed vocally to supporting Judge Gorsuch</text>
<text start="335.835" dur="1.869">throughout the confirmation process and</text>
<text start="337.704" dur="2.869">
expressed their desire for the Senate to move swiftly
</text>
<text start="340.573" dur="2.569">to give him a fair hearing and vote.</text>
<text start="343.142" dur="1.502">The meeting closed with the President inviting the</text>
<text start="344.644" dur="1.902">group into the Oval Office, which several</text>
<text start="346.546" dur="2.135">attendees really enjoyed that honor.</text>
<text start="348.681" dur="2.069">The President then had lunch with Secretary of</text>
<text start="350.75" dur="1.768">State Designee Tillerson.</text>
<text start="352.518" dur="2.269">
Mr. Tillerson&#39;s tenacity, broad experience, and deep
</text>
<text start="354.787" dur="2.603">understanding of the geo-politics are going to</text>
<text start="357.39" dur="2.035">make him an outstanding chief diplomat for</text>
<text start="359.425" dur="1.101">the United States.</text>
<text start="360.526" dur="1.936">And the President is looking forward to the</text>
<text start="362.462" dur="2.702">full vote of the Senate on his nomination.</text>
<text start="365.164" dur="2.236">Later this evening, the President will participate</text>
<text start="367.4" dur="2.436">in a standing legislative affairs strategy meeting</text>
<text start="369.836" dur="2.469">with his team who have been working closely with</text>
<text start="372.305" dur="2.702">Congress to enact the President&#39;s agenda.</text>
<text start="375.007" dur="2.236">
So far, between the Vice President and staff, we&#39;ve
</text>
<text start="377.243" dur="1.969">had as many productive conversations with members</text>
<text start="379.212" dur="3.203">of both parties on both chambers on a variety of</text>
<text start="382.415" dur="2.936">
issues from trade to the President&#39;s nomination for
</text>
<text start="385.351" dur="3.003">his cabinet, and now the Supreme Court.</text>
<text start="388.354" dur="1.902">Now, starting this week, our legislative affairs</text>
<text start="390.256" dur="2.169">team will also conduct excessive outreach on</text>
<text start="392.425" dur="2.669">behalf of Judge Gorsuch&#39;s nomination process.</text>
<text start="395.094" dur="2.202">Clearly, this Administration has made</text>
<text start="397.296" dur="4.605">
reaching out to Congress a top priority, but you know
</text>
<text start="401.901" dur="1.635">where I&#39;m going with that.</text>
<text start="403.536" dur="2.236">Democrats in the Senate continue to use every tool</text>
<text start="405.772" dur="2.068">at their disposal to try to get a way of the</text>
<text start="407.84" dur="1.835">President&#39;s attempts to make the country -- to</text>
<text start="409.675" dur="1.535">make America great again.</text>
<text start="411.21" dur="2.136">Just today, Senate Democrats again, refused</text>
<text start="413.346" dur="2.469">to even participate in committee votes for Senate</text>
<text start="415.815" dur="2.269">designates price and (inaudible) who were moved</text>
<text start="418.084" dur="1.568">out of the Finance Committee with zero</text>
<text start="419.652" dur="1.535">Democrats present.</text>
<text start="421.187" dur="2.903">
Democrats also boycotted EPA Administrator designee
</text>
<text start="424.09" dur="1.301">Pruitt&#39;s hearing.</text>
<text start="425.391" dur="1.802">They&#39;re doing this -- their doing their</text>
<text start="427.193" dur="2.769">constituents and our country a disservice by</text>
<text start="429.962" dur="2.603">resorting to these childish tactics.</text>
<text start="432.565" dur="2.302">
The President&#39;s cabinet nominees will be confirmed
</text>
<text start="434.867" dur="2.236">on the floor of the Senate, once Democrats</text>
<text start="437.103" dur="2.502">actually allow them to get a fair vote.</text>
<text start="439.605" dur="2.102">In other cabinet news, Attorney General Designee,</text>
<text start="441.707" dur="1.969">Senator Jeff Sessions, was voted out</text>
<text start="443.676" dur="1.135">of committee today.</text>
<text start="444.811" dur="1.868">We look forward to his full vote as the next</text>
<text start="446.679" dur="1.268">Attorney General.</text>
<text start="447.947" dur="2.069">Additionally, Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson</text>
<text start="450.016" dur="2.769">Designee is expected to receive a vote by the full</text>
<text start="452.785" dur="1.435">Senate this afternoon.</text>
<text start="454.22" dur="2.569">
And finally, Veteran&#39;s Administration Secretary
</text>
<text start="456.789" dur="3.337">Designee, Dr. David Shulkin will go before the</text>
<text start="460.126" dur="2.369">Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs at 2:30</text>
<text start="462.495" dur="1.001">this afternoon.</text>
<text start="463.496" dur="2.803">
A few more things before I open it up for questions.
</text>
<text start="466.299" dur="2.135">In terms of the schedule tomorrow, the President</text>
<text start="468.434" dur="2.136">will attend the National Prayer Breakfast and have</text>
<text start="470.57" dur="1.935">lunch with Harley Davidson&#39;s -- Harley</text>
<text start="472.505" dur="2.269">Davidson executives here at the White House.</text>
<text start="474.774" dur="1.835">The President will also meet with Senator Hatch,</text>

<text start="478.544" dur="1.935">Neal and Congressman Brady.</text>
<text start="480.479" dur="1.569">Further guidance on all of those meetings</text>
<text start="482.048" dur="0.801">will be coming soon.</text>
<text start="482.849" dur="2.736">A few personnel announcements -- today,</text>
<text start="485.585" dur="1.768">the President sent the following nominations to</text>
<text start="487.353" dur="1.468">the Senate: Rachel L.</text>

<text start="497.096" dur="2.002">to be a Deputy Attorney General.</text>
<text start="499.098" dur="2.236">On another note, yesterday, we talked about</text>
<text start="501.334" dur="1.535">recent reporting concerning the President&#39;s</text>
<text start="502.869" dur="2.936">Executive Order protecting the nation from foreign</text>
<text start="505.805" dur="1.234">terrorist entry.</text>
<text start="507.039" dur="1.669">I want to draw your attention to some polls</text>
<text start="508.708" dur="1.801">that have come out on that subject.</text>
<text start="510.509" dur="2.136">For all the hysteria around the implementation</text>
<text start="512.645" dur="2.369">of this order, the American people as a whole</text>
<text start="515.014" dur="1.568">are very supportive of the action that the</text>
<text start="516.582" dur="1.535">President is taking.</text>
<text start="518.117" dur="3.237">A new Rasmussen report poll finds that 57</text>
<text start="521.354" dur="2.936">percent, which is a clear majority of likely U.S.</text>
<text start="524.29" dur="3.303">voters favor a temporary ban from Syria, Iraq,</text>
<text start="527.593" dur="3.971">Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen until the</text>
<text start="531.564" dur="1.902">government can do a better job of keeping these</text>
<text start="533.466" dur="2.536">individuals out who pose a threat.</text>
<text start="536.002" dur="2.602">A Reuters poll found that 66 percent of Americans</text>
<text start="538.604" dur="2.569">believe that the United States should limit the</text>
<text start="541.173" dur="3.237">number of refugees into the country and the safety</text>
<text start="544.41" dur="2.002">
of the American people and the security of American
</text>
<text start="546.412" dur="2.803">homeland are the President&#39;s top priority</text>
<text start="549.215" dur="1.902">and most Americans agree with the steps that he is</text>
<text start="551.117" dur="2.369">taking to keep our country safe.</text>
<text start="553.486" dur="2.569">
Further, today, the United Arab Emirates&#39; Foreign
</text>
<text start="556.055" dur="2.169">Minister voiced his support for the President</text>

In these and other similar activities, Iran continues

<text start="703.235" dur="2.369">As we start off, I mentioned yesterday, I&#39;m</text>
<text start="705.604" dur="2.002">pleased that we&#39;ve expanded the briefing room</text>

at least virtually, and so with that, as I begin to
</text>
<text start="711.343" dur="2.436">
take your questions, I&#39;m pleased to offer the first
</text>
<text start="713.779" dur="2.503">ever Skype-seat question in the White House</text>

<text start="721.687" dur="0.667">Good afternoon.</text>
<text start="722.354" dur="0.801">Can you hear me okay?</text>
<text start="723.155" dur="0.701">Mr. Spicer: We can.</text>
<text start="723.856" dur="2.202">The Press: Great.</text>
<text start="726.058" dur="2.136">Just this week, the mayor of Providence, Rhode</text>
<text start="728.194" dur="2.569">Island began calling our capital city a</text>
<text start="730.763" dur="1.234">sanctuary city.</text>
<text start="731.997" dur="2.236">As we know, President Trump&#39;s Executive Order</text>
<text start="734.233" dur="2.736">
says the White House will begin publicizing a weekly
</text>
<text start="736.969" dur="2.903">list of these municipalities and pledges</text>
<text start="739.872" dur="2.302">to withdraw federal grant money from them.</text>
<text start="742.174" dur="3.17">
What I&#39;m wondering is, how soon can we expect to see
</text>
<text start="745.344" dur="2.269">this list and how soon should cities like</text>
<text start="747.613" dur="2.536">
Providence expect to see their federal funding cut?
</text>
<text start="750.149" dur="3.303">Mr. Spicer: Thanks, Kim.</text>
<text start="753.452" dur="2.302">
I think the President&#39;s goal in ending sanctuary
</text>
<text start="755.754" dur="2.236">cities is pretty clear.</text>
<text start="757.99" dur="1.435">We want to, as we mentioned with these</text>
<text start="759.425" dur="2.202">others actions, keep America safe.</text>
<text start="761.627" dur="2.402">
The goal is to make sure on two fronts: one, we are
</text>
<text start="764.029" dur="2.87">
doing everything we can to protect American citizens,
</text>
<text start="766.899" dur="3.837">institutions and ending sanctuary cities is one of</text>
<text start="770.736" dur="2.102">the way in which we continue to do that.</text>
<text start="772.838" dur="1.835">Furthermore, the President&#39;s been very</text>
<text start="774.673" dur="2.169">clear through his Executive Order that</text>
<text start="776.842" dur="2.936">federal funds paid for by hard working taxpayers</text>
<text start="779.778" dur="3.037">should not be used to help fund sanctuary cities.</text>
<text start="782.815" dur="1.802">As we continue to implement this Executive</text>
<text start="784.617" dur="2.602">
Order and fulfill the pledge that he made, we&#39;ll
</text>
<text start="787.219" dur="2.136">have further updates on how we intend to -- how</text>
<text start="789.355" dur="2.869">that list will come out and when it come out, so I</text>
<text start="792.224" dur="2.069">look forward to following up on that as well.</text>
<text start="794.293" dur="1.401">With that, David Jackson.</text>
<text start="795.694" dur="4.472">The Press: David is not here, but I&#39;ll ask</text>
<text start="800.166" dur="0.667">a question.</text>
<text start="800.833" dur="2.336">Mr. Spicer: Go for it.</text>
<text start="803.169" dur="0.667">(laughter)</text>
<text start="803.836" dur="1.735">The Press: (inaudible) Skype.</text>
<text start="805.571" dur="0.667">(laughter)</text>
<text start="806.238" dur="3.637">
The Press: The President&#39;s daily briefing has been --
</text>
<text start="809.875" dur="1.735">remained of daily intelligence briefing.</text>
<text start="811.61" dur="1.869">Can you tell me how that differs at all</text>
<text start="813.479" dur="1.034">from the PDB?</text>
<text start="814.513" dur="1.535">
Is the President receiving his intelligence briefing
</text>
<text start="816.048" dur="2.402">in writing or orally and who is giving it to him?</text>
<text start="818.45" dur="1.936">
Mr. Spicer: He did receive an intelligence briefing
</text>
<text start="820.386" dur="1.768">today with Congressman -- or Director</text>
<text start="822.154" dur="2.169">Pompeii was here.</text>
<text start="824.323" dur="3.103">General Flynn, his National Security Advisor</text>
<text start="827.426" dur="3.17">-- his briefer, so he receives an intelligence</text>
<text start="830.596" dur="1.368">briefing and the PBD every day.</text>
<text start="831.964" dur="1.902">The Press: Is there any sense that we should get</text>
<text start="833.866" dur="1.668">out of the renaming from the PDB?</text>
<text start="835.534" dur="2.403">
Mr. Spicer: I think that it is a more comprehensive
</text>
<text start="837.937" dur="1.968">-- I think, again, we went through this during the</text>
<text start="839.905" dur="1.335">transition period, right.</text>
<text start="841.24" dur="1.335">There is a difference between the raw</text>
<text start="842.575" dur="2.602">intelligence and the analysis and I think he is</text>
<text start="845.177" dur="2.77">
constantly updated by his National Security team and
</text>
<text start="847.947" dur="2.135">other intelligence officials, but every</text>
<text start="850.082" dur="2.369">single day, he does receive the PDB.</text>
<text start="852.451" dur="1.869">
And the -- and then I think on top of that, he&#39;s
</text>
<text start="854.32" dur="2.569">receiving intelligence briefings from his team.</text>
<text start="856.889" dur="2.002">The Press: But the oral briefing does not</text>
<text start="858.891" dur="1.068">necessarily happen every day?</text>
<text start="859.959" dur="2.135">Mr. Spicer: Well, I can get back to you on that.</text>
<text start="862.094" dur="2.503">
He does get the PDB every day and on a regular -- on
</text>
<text start="864.597" dur="1.601">a daily basis meets</text>
<text start="866.198" dur="1.535">with his intelligence team, yes. Hunter?</text>
<text start="867.733" dur="1.635">The Press: Two quick questions on --</text>
<text start="869.368" dur="2.069">Mr. Spicer: We&#39;re not going to do this again.</text>
<text start="871.437" dur="1.368">The Press: On Black History Month.</text>
<text start="872.805" dur="0.7">Mr. Spicer: Yeah.</text>
<text start="873.505" dur="2.069">The Press: Is President Obama being invited to any</text>
<text start="875.574" dur="1.402">of the Black History Month celebrations?</text>
<text start="876.976" dur="1.401">Mr. Spicer: Not that I&#39;m aware of.</text>
<text start="878.377" dur="1.201">It&#39;s day one.</text>
<text start="879.578" dur="1.101">We just started it off.</text>
<text start="880.679" dur="2.169">
We&#39;ll have to get back to you on further details.
</text>
<text start="882.848" dur="0.667">I think --</text>
<text start="883.515" dur="1.368">The Press: A second one if I may?</text>
<text start="884.883" dur="2.036">Mr. Spicer: I think we have a lot -- there&#39;s a</text>
<text start="886.919" dur="1.335">lot of activity since I mentioned that the</text>
<text start="888.254" dur="2.502">President is going to do to celebrate and honor</text>
<text start="890.756" dur="3.403">this month, and this was just the first day of the</text>
<text start="894.159" dur="0.801">month of February.</text>
<text start="894.96" dur="2.169">The Press: Today, he made the comment about</text>
<text start="897.129" dur="1.869">Frederick Douglass being recognized more and more.</text>
<text start="898.998" dur="2.269">Do you have any idea what specifically, he was</text>
<text start="901.267" dur="0.7">referring to?</text>
<text start="901.967" dur="2.102">
Mr. Spicer: Well, I think there&#39;s contribution.
</text>
<text start="904.069" dur="1.335">I think he wants to highlight the</text>
<text start="905.404" dur="2.469">contributions that he has made and I think that</text>
<text start="907.873" dur="2.569">through a lot of the actions and statements</text>
<text start="910.442" dur="1.936">
that he&#39;s going to make, I think the contributions of
</text>
<text start="912.378" dur="0.734">Frederick Douglass will</text>
<text start="913.112" dur="1.768">become more and more. Kristin?</text>
<text start="914.88" dur="1.135">The Press: Thank you.</text>
<text start="916.015" dur="3.837">Very quickly, can you clarify what was meant by,</text>
<text start="919.852" dur="1.201">&quot;We&#39;re putting Iran on notice?&quot;</text>
<text start="921.053" dur="2.302">Mr. Spicer: Well, as I mentioned, I think General</text>
<text start="923.355" dur="2.036">Flynn and the NSC staff will have a</text>
<text start="925.391" dur="0.834">briefing at 4:00.</text>
<text start="926.225" dur="2.069">
They can go forward on the -- I&#39;m not going to get --
</text>
<text start="928.294" dur="2.535">
I think we wanted to make very clear that we felt as
</text>
<text start="930.829" dur="3.037">though that -- their actions were both</text>
<text start="933.866" dur="3.236">provocative and a violation and making sure</text>
<text start="937.102" dur="2.002">
that they understood that we weren&#39;t going to sit by
</text>
<text start="939.104" dur="3.771">and not act on those actions.</text>
<text start="942.875" dur="1.768">The Press: Are you building the case on --?</text>
<text start="944.643" dur="2.169">
Mr. Spicer: I&#39;m just -- I&#39;m not going to go any

<text start="946.812" dur="0.834">further than that Kristin.</text>
<text start="947.646" dur="0.668">No, no.</text>
<text start="948.314" dur="2.235">The Press: Let me ask you about -- let me just ask</text>
<text start="950.549" dur="1.335">you about the confirmation hearings.</text>
<text start="951.884" dur="0.667">Mr. Spicer: Okay.</text>
<text start="952.551" dur="1.502">The Press: How does the President plan to get</text>
<text start="954.053" dur="1.868">Chuck Schumer on board with his pick for the</text>
<text start="955.921" dur="1.435">Supreme Court, Neal Gorsuch, when he has</text>
<text start="957.356" dur="2.469">referred to him as a clown and accused him</text>
<text start="959.825" dur="0.667">of fake tears?</text>
<text start="960.492" dur="1.902">Mr. Spicer: Well, I think those are two things.</text>
<text start="962.394" dur="2.102">
I think we&#39;re going -- you look at the support that&#39;s
</text>
<text start="964.496" dur="1.068">already come out.</text>
<text start="965.564" dur="2.269">
I think there&#39;s eight senators already that have
</text>
<text start="967.833" dur="1.935">talked about the need to have a vote and</text>
<text start="969.768" dur="0.868">his qualifications.</text>
<text start="970.636" dur="1.468">And not just the Senate, but I mean, you look at</text>
<text start="972.104" dur="2.569">the widespread support that came out for Judge</text>
<text start="974.673" dur="2.803">Gorsuch last night across the spectrum.</text>
<text start="977.476" dur="2.035">No matter your philosophical view of the</text>
<text start="979.511" dur="2.002">court, I think his qualifications for the</text>
<text start="981.513" dur="3.504">court; his academic background make him an</text>
<text start="985.017" dur="2.202">unbelievably highly qualified person and so</text>
<text start="987.219" dur="1.935">it&#39;s not just Chuck Schumer, I think the rest</text>
<text start="989.154" dur="1.969">of the Senate as he goes up there.</text>
<text start="991.123" dur="1.001">But I think the interesting --</text>

shown time and time again through this confirmation

process with the Cabinet that he&#39;s more interested

<text start="1003.435" dur="1.635">And I think that&#39;s -- that is troubling.</text>
<text start="1005.07" dur="2.036">I would ask you that I think the question needs</text>
<text start="1007.106" dur="2.002">to be asked to Chuck Schumer, &quot;Why are you</text>
<text start="1009.108" dur="1.801">stalling all of these nominees?</text>

What are you insisting on new requirements that you

I mean, there&#39;s a point at which they need to get

There&#39;s an element to which they need to be held

There&#39;s a lot of comments that he&#39;s made and a lot
</text>
<text start="1054.086" dur="1.335">
of accusations that he&#39;s thrown out there and a lot
</text>
<text start="1055.421" dur="0.667">of politics that he&#39;s played.</text>
<text start="1056.088" dur="1.335">At some point, Chuck Schumer needs to be</text>
<text start="1057.423" dur="0.667">held accountable for his</text>
<text start="1058.09" dur="1.735">actions and his words. Blake.</text>
<text start="1059.825" dur="2.169">The Press: (inaudible) built the possibility on</text>
<text start="1061.994" dur="3.003">the Supreme Court, John, possibility of going the</text>
<text start="1064.997" dur="1.902">route of the nuclear option.</text>
<text start="1066.899" dur="3.77">If it gets to that point, is the White House</text>
<text start="1070.669" dur="1.502">comfortable with that path?</text>
<text start="1072.171" dur="2.969">Mr. Spicer: I think the President made clear his</text>
<text start="1075.14" dur="2.436">goal today, which is number one, he believes</text>
<text start="1077.576" dur="2.669">Judge Gorsuch is unbelievably qualified,</text>
<text start="1080.245" dur="2.036">and that he will get nominated and not only</text>
<text start="1082.281" dur="1.401">confirmed, but done so</text>
<text start="1083.682" dur="2.202">with a large bipartisan vote.</text>
<text start="1085.884" dur="3.003">As I said at the outset, Republicans looked at the</text>
<text start="1088.887" dur="4.104">
qualifications of the two justices that got through
</text>
<text start="1092.991" dur="3.237">in the Obama Administration and while</text>
<text start="1096.228" dur="2.169">they may not have agreed with their judicial</text>
<text start="1098.397" dur="2.602">philosophy, definitely agreed that they were</text>
<text start="1100.999" dur="2.269">qualified on the merits to be confirmed</text>
<text start="1103.268" dur="0.901">and they did so.</text>
<text start="1104.169" dur="2.169">I think we would ask that we be held to the same</text>
<text start="1106.338" dur="2.302">standard that the Democrats used when they</text>
<text start="1108.64" dur="1.035">had nominees up.</text>
<text start="1109.675" dur="1.668">But I think the President made very clear that the</text>
<text start="1111.343" dur="2.736">
decision is something that we would rather not have
</text>
<text start="1114.079" dur="2.202">to go down, but also, that it ultimately is up to</text>
<text start="1116.281" dur="0.868">Senator McConnell and how</text>
<text start="1117.149" dur="1.134">he wants to operate this thing.</text>
<text start="1118.283" dur="0.668">John (inaudible).</text>
<text start="1118.951" dur="1.601">The Press: Thank you, Sean.</text>
<text start="1120.552" dur="2.069">Just one question today.</text>
<text start="1122.621" dur="1.401">Ms. Spicer: Yeah.</text>
<text start="1124.022" dur="3.27">The Press: Leading up to Judge Gorsuch&#39;s</text>
<text start="1127.292" dur="3.871">announcement last night and him coming out after,</text>
<text start="1131.163" dur="2.402">there were still rumors that Judge Hardiman was</text>
<text start="1133.565" dur="2.469">going to be nominated and he, in fact, drove to</text>
<text start="1136.034" dur="0.668">Washington --</text>
<text start="1136.702" dur="1.168">Mr. Spicer: No, actually, John.</text>
<text start="1137.87" dur="0.7">He didn&#39;t.</text>
<text start="1138.57" dur="2.202">That was media -- that was misreporting.</text>
<text start="1140.772" dur="1.869">My understanding is that Judge Hardiman never left</text>
<text start="1142.641" dur="1.535">the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</text>
<text start="1144.176" dur="2.069">So, with all due respect, I can&#39;t be held</text>
<text start="1146.245" dur="3.703">
accountable for mis -- you know, reports that falsely
</text>
<text start="1149.948" dur="1.201">stated he was here.</text>
<text start="1151.149" dur="1.602">He never was at the White House.</text>
<text start="1152.751" dur="1.668">My understanding is that he had a meeting in</text>
<text start="1154.419" dur="3.07">
Eastern Pennsylvania with another judge, but it was
</text>
<text start="1157.489" dur="2.503">
-- my -- and again, I&#39;m not -- I don&#39;t track where
</text>
<text start="1159.992" dur="1.968">his whereabouts, but my understanding is that he</text>
<text start="1161.96" dur="0.868">never left the Commonwealth of</text>
<text start="1162.828" dur="3.303">Pennsylvania yesterday, so it was, you know, we</text>
<text start="1166.131" dur="2.002">announced when we were going to make this</text>
<text start="1168.133" dur="0.901">announcement.</text>
<text start="1169.034" dur="1.768">I think it was a phenomenal way to</text>
<text start="1170.802" dur="3.304">
introduce Judge Gorsuch to the American people and to
</text>
<text start="1174.106" dur="1.101">the United States Senate.</text>
<text start="1175.207" dur="3.07">We invited Democratic leaders, Democratic</text>
<text start="1178.277" dur="2.802">leaders -- members of the judiciary committee.</text>
<text start="1181.079" dur="1.335">Unfortunately, none of them showed up.</text>
<text start="1182.414" dur="3.27">
But it was an opportunity for them and the American
</text>
<text start="1185.684" dur="2.169">people to see an amazing choice that the President</text>
<text start="1187.853" dur="1.201">made for the Bench (inaudible).</text>
<text start="1189.054" dur="2.135">The Press: Sean, my question is --</text>
<text start="1191.189" dur="1.602">Mr. Spicer: You said one, John.</text>
<text start="1192.791" dur="0.667">(laughter)</text>
<text start="1193.458" dur="1.435">The Press: (inaudible) asked the question.</text>
<text start="1194.893" dur="3.137">My question is simply this, with the support</text>
<text start="1198.03" dur="1.535">that he received, the people called the</text>
<text start="1199.565" dur="3.269">President, would it be safe to say that Judge</text>
<text start="1202.834" dur="2.67">Hardiman will be on deck if there is another</text>
<text start="1205.504" dur="0.901">vacancy soon?</text>
<text start="1206.405" dur="2.736">Say, Justice Kennedy retiring by the end</text>
<text start="1209.141" dur="0.667">of the term?</text>
<text start="1209.808" dur="1.568">
Mr. Spicer: Well, I think there&#39;s a lot of vacancies
</text>
<text start="1211.376" dur="1.835">that we see at the appellate level and</text>
<text start="1213.211" dur="1.402">throughout the government.</text>
<text start="1214.613" dur="3.103">He&#39;s an impressive, impressive jurist.</text>
<text start="1217.716" dur="2.703">Obviously, the four that really made that final</text>
<text start="1220.419" dur="2.736">list for the President were unbelievably</text>
<text start="1223.155" dur="1.301">impressive.</text>
<text start="1224.456" dur="2.102">
So, I don&#39;t want to get in front of the President.
</text>
<text start="1226.558" dur="3.303">Hopefully, you know, he continues to have the</text>
<text start="1229.861" dur="2.103">
President&#39;s support and someone the President was
</text>
<text start="1231.964" dur="1.434">unbelievably impressed with.</text>
<text start="1233.398" dur="2.369">
So we&#39;ll have to see what vacancies come with down
</text>
<text start="1235.767" dur="0.835">the pike. Anita?</text>
<text start="1236.602" dur="2.535">The Press: I know you love when we say we have two</text>
<text start="1239.137" dur="0.668">questions.</text>
<text start="1239.805" dur="1.701">I do have two quick questions about something</text>
<text start="1241.506" dur="1.802">you mentioned at the top.</text>
<text start="1243.308" dur="2.202">
First, you mentioned the three folks that are being
</text>
<text start="1245.51" dur="1.335">nominated to the Department of Justice.</text>
<text start="1246.845" dur="0.667">Mr. Spicer: Right.</text>
<text start="1247.512" dur="1.802">The Press: Why are they being nominated now before</text>
<text start="1249.314" dur="1.235">Senator Sessions is there?</text>
<text start="1250.549" dur="2.769">Is it because there is a lack of people?</text>
<text start="1253.318" dur="0.668">Was he consulted?</text>
<text start="1253.986" dur="2.435">Or is it just because of the whole issue this week</text>
<text start="1256.421" dur="1.335">with the acting attorney general?</text>
<text start="1257.756" dur="1.969">
Mr. Spicer: It&#39;s just a - I mean, it&#39;s the normal
</text>
<text start="1259.725" dur="2.636">
process of getting those -- I&#39;ve mentioned it in a
</text>
<text start="1262.361" dur="2.402">few briefings that the deputies, the unders, and</text>
<text start="1264.763" dur="1.335">the actings are in the pipeline.</text>
<text start="1266.098" dur="2.168">This is -- we announced one the other day</text>
<text start="1268.266" dur="0.668">for homeland.</text>
<text start="1268.934" dur="1.968">
We&#39;ve got the commerce is previously announced and
</text>
<text start="1270.902" dur="2.103">so this is just a continuation of the</text>
<text start="1273.005" dur="1.067">process to fill --</text>
<text start="1274.072" dur="1.335">The Press: (inaudible) under Sessions.</text>
<text start="1275.407" dur="1.568">I mean, speaking with him and?</text>
<text start="1276.975" dur="2.069">Mr. Spicer: Of course, he was -- these are people</text>
<text start="1279.044" dur="2.202">that he&#39;s clearly aware of and supportive of</text>
<text start="1281.246" dur="0.768">100 percent. Yeah.</text>
<text start="1282.014" dur="1.568">The Press: And the second question was, you</text>
<text start="1283.582" dur="2.836">mentioned tomorrow the meeting with the Harley</text>
<text start="1286.418" dur="0.701">Davidson executives.</text>
<text start="1287.119" dur="2.736">
There&#39;s reporting that he was supposed to go to
</text>
<text start="1289.855" dur="2.202">Milwaukee tomorrow or he was supposed to.</text>
<text start="1292.057" dur="2.169">That was canceled because of the company.</text>
<text start="1294.226" dur="1.568">Can you talk about that?</text>
<text start="1295.794" dur="2.469">Mr. Spicer: Yeah, I just think -- look, it was</text>
<text start="1298.263" dur="4.438">easier for the -- for the executives to come here</text>
<text start="1302.701" dur="1.868">considering the week and all of the activity</text>
<text start="1304.569" dur="0.901">that&#39;s been going on.</text>
<text start="1305.47" dur="3.237">
And we figured the easiest thing to do was, again, no
</text>
<text start="1308.707" dur="1.902">decision had been made about or announced as to</text>
<text start="1310.609" dur="1.001">what we were doing.</text>
<text start="1311.61" dur="1.735">We looked at different options and ultimately,</text>
<text start="1313.345" dur="1.968">the easiest thing to do in accordance with the</text>
<text start="1315.313" dur="2.169">
President&#39;s schedule was to invite them here to
</text>
<text start="1317.482" dur="1.936">Washington to talk about some of the stuff that</text>
<text start="1319.418" dur="0.667">we&#39;ve been doing.</text>
<text start="1320.085" dur="1.368">The Press: Are you concerned about</text>
<text start="1321.453" dur="0.667">protesting?</text>
<text start="1322.12" dur="1.335">Mr. Spicer: We&#39;re not concerned.</text>
<text start="1323.455" dur="1.335">I think we&#39;re not concerned about that.</text>
<text start="1324.79" dur="1.334">
We&#39;re concerned about -- we&#39;re concerned about
</text>
<text start="1326.124" dur="3.637">
American jobs, moving this economy forward, and we&#39;re
</text>
<text start="1329.761" dur="2.67">exited to welcome them here to Washington to talk</text>
<text start="1332.431" dur="1.735">about the great work that they do and the many of</text>
<text start="1334.166" dur="1.401">thousands of people that they employ.</text>
<text start="1335.567" dur="1.735">With that, let me go to the -- I&#39;m going to --</text>
<text start="1337.302" dur="1.468">we&#39;re going to be here a while, guys.</text>
<text start="1338.77" dur="1.368">We&#39;re going to the second Skype seat.</text>
<text start="1340.138" dur="1.368">Natalie Herbick from Fox</text>
<text start="1341.506" dur="1.869">8 in Cleveland, Ohio. Natalie?</text>
<text start="1343.375" dur="2.336">The Press: Secretary Spicer, thank you so much</text>
<text start="1345.711" dur="1.267">for this rare opportunity.</text>
<text start="1346.978" dur="0.901">I appreciate it.</text>
<text start="1347.879" dur="1.068">I&#39;m learning the ropes now.</text>
<text start="1348.947" dur="1.468">Mr. Spicer: Natalie, you&#39;re coming back.</text>
<text start="1350.415" dur="1.468">The Press: I&#39;d like to quickly ask two</text>
<text start="1351.883" dur="1.068">questions if I may?</text>
<text start="1352.951" dur="3.67">The first one being, President Trump has been</text>
<text start="1356.621" dur="2.47">quick to take action on several issues he&#39;s</text>
<text start="1359.091" dur="1.368">addressed along the campaign trail.</text>
<text start="1360.459" dur="2.469">And with that in mind, he made a stop here in</text>
<text start="1362.928" dur="2.469">Cleveland, and he said that he would like to make</text>
<text start="1365.397" dur="1.468">cities like ours the</text>
<text start="1366.865" dur="1.969">economic envy of the world.</text>
<text start="1368.834" dur="0.767">A bold statement.</text>
<text start="1369.601" dur="3.237">So, our viewers would love to know an example -- a</text>
<text start="1372.838" dur="2.369">specific example -- as to how he plans to do this</text>
<text start="1375.207" dur="0.8">sooner than later.</text>
<text start="1376.007" dur="1.535">Mr. Spicer: That&#39;s a great question, Natalie.</text>
<text start="1377.542" dur="2.136">I think it&#39;s not just Cleveland, but it&#39;s</text>
<text start="1379.678" dur="2.769">Detroit and so many of the other cities around the</text>
<text start="1382.447" dur="3.003">
country you&#39;ve heard the President talk about the
</text>
<text start="1385.45" dur="2.069">need to rebuild our inner cities.</text>
<text start="1387.519" dur="1.101">We were really impressed</text>
<text start="1388.62" dur="1.969">with Cleveland this past July.</text>
<text start="1390.589" dur="1.968">We went there for the National Convention.</text>
<text start="1392.557" dur="2.169">The people of Cleveland, their desire, and the</text>
<text start="1394.726" dur="2.069">rebound that the city has taken.</text>
<text start="1396.795" dur="1.535">
And I think that when you go to whether it&#39;s a city
</text>
<text start="1398.33" dur="3.036">
like Cleveland or Detroit through different tax and
</text>
<text start="1401.366" dur="2.703">regulatory measures there&#39;s a way that we can</text>
<text start="1404.069" dur="1.501">continue to bring manufacturing back.</text>
<text start="1405.57" dur="2.169">We can continue to bring jobs back.</text>
<text start="1407.739" dur="1.802">And whether it&#39;s, you know, Harley Davidson or</text>
<text start="1409.541" dur="4.371">Carrier, Lockheed, or Boeing, or the GM, Fiat,</text>
<text start="1413.912" dur="2.936">Ford -- these companies he continues to talk with</text>
<text start="1416.848" dur="3.037">about how they can bring jobs back, relocate.</text>
<text start="1419.885" dur="1.668">Again, that was another one of the conversations</text>
<text start="1421.553" dur="1.468">that he had with the pharmaceutical companies</text>
<text start="1423.021" dur="2.469">yesterday -- how can they bring jobs back?</text>
<text start="1425.49" dur="2.136">How can we ease regulations to do that?</text>
<text start="1427.626" dur="2.669">So, it&#39;s about making sure that we have an</text>
<text start="1430.295" dur="4.638">environment, Natalie, that allows more cities to</text>
<text start="1434.933" dur="2.936">compete, to grow the manufacturing base, and to</text>
<text start="1437.869" dur="4.738">recognize the things that we can do tax wise and</text>
<text start="1442.607" dur="2.736">regulatory wise to allow that to flourish.</text>
<text start="1445.343" dur="0.768">Yeah, Cecilia?</text>
<text start="1446.111" dur="1.501">The Press: Thank you.</text>
<text start="1447.612" dur="2.503">And Steve Bannon can be heard on recording saying,</text>
<text start="1450.115" dur="3.103">
&quot;Islam is a dark religion, not a religion of peace, a
</text>
<text start="1453.218" dur="0.968">religion of submission.&quot;</text>
<text start="1454.186" dur="2.202">
Does the President share his Chief Strategist&#39;s
</text>
<text start="1456.388" dur="1.268">apparent beliefs on Islam?</text>
<text start="1457.656" dur="1.868">
Mr. Spicer: No, I think the President&#39;s been very
</text>
<text start="1459.524" dur="3.103">
clear that his number one goal is not to target any
</text>
<text start="1462.627" dur="4.205">
one religion, but places and areas where we believe
</text>
<text start="1466.832" dur="0.7">that there is an issue.</text>
<text start="1467.532" dur="1.902">
That&#39;s what the executive order was all about the
</text>
<text start="1469.434" dur="2.169">
other day -- making sure that areas that we don&#39;t
</text>
<text start="1471.603" dur="2.436">feel have the proper mechanisms in place to</text>
<text start="1474.039" dur="1.268">ensure the security.</text>
<text start="1475.307" dur="2.903">
That when they travel the United States that we know
</text>
<text start="1478.21" dur="1.768">they&#39;re coming here for peaceful purposes.</text>
<text start="1479.978" dur="2.269">
The President&#39;s number one goal has always been to
</text>
<text start="1482.247" dur="3.437">focus on the safety of America, not the religion.</text>
<text start="1485.684" dur="2.202">
He understands that it&#39;s not a religious problem.
</text>
<text start="1487.886" dur="2.436">
It&#39;s a radicalization problem and there&#39;s a big
</text>
<text start="1490.322" dur="2.869">difference between Islam the religion and radical</text>
<text start="1493.191" dur="1.568">Islamic terrorists that come here to seek</text>
<text start="1494.759" dur="0.668">to do us harm.</text>
<text start="1495.427" dur="1.468">The Press: But nothing about this comment that</text>
<text start="1496.895" dur="1.802">the President wants to distance himself from or</text>
<text start="1498.697" dur="1.134">even elaborate on?</text>
<text start="1499.831" dur="2.036">
Mr. Spicer: I just think I made it clear that there&#39;s
</text>
<text start="1501.867" dur="1.401">
a difference between the President&#39;s view. Yeah?
</text>
<text start="1503.268" dur="1.335">The Press: Thanks.</text>
<text start="1504.603" dur="2.936">There have been multiple reports of people landing</text>

So, that&#39;s in violation of at least five of these
</text>
<text start="1517.115" dur="1.902">federal judges orders that came down.</text>

<text start="1526.324" dur="1.735">thinking about certain aspects of the order?</text>
<text start="1528.059" dur="2.236">
Mr. Spicer: Well, I think that we just -- we issued
</text>
<text start="1530.295" dur="3.17">earlier today some clarification -- an update</text>
<text start="1533.465" dur="4.771">
from the council&#39;s office that clarifies section 3C
</text>
<text start="1538.236" dur="3.404">and 3E that legal permanent residents --</text>
<text start="1541.64" dur="3.303">LPRs -- do not -- that the waiver, we no longer</text>
<text start="1544.943" dur="1.401">need a waiver.</text>
<text start="1546.344" dur="2.87">Initially as the program was lifting off the idea</text>
<text start="1549.214" dur="1.468">was that they would go through, be granted a</text>
<text start="1550.682" dur="1.768">waiver of which everyone was issued a</text>
<text start="1552.45" dur="1.202">waiver coming in.</text>
<text start="1553.652" dur="3.837">In the sake of efficiency, we have interpreted the</text>
<text start="1557.489" dur="2.803">guidance to all of these agencies to both the</text>
<text start="1560.292" dur="1.935">Acting Secretary of State, the Acting Attorney</text>
<text start="1562.227" dur="2.669">
General and the Secretary of Homeland Security that
</text>
<text start="1564.896" dur="2.77">the guidance is that all individuals responsible</text>
<text start="1567.666" dur="1.601">for the administration implementation of this</text>
<text start="1569.267" dur="1.969">order that that does not apply.</text>
<text start="1571.236" dur="2.769">They no longer need a waiver because if they are</text>
<text start="1574.005" dur="1.168">a legal permanent resident</text>
<text start="1575.173" dur="1.235">they won&#39;t need it anymore.</text>
<text start="1576.408" dur="2.903">The Press: Sean, on Glass-Steagall.</text>
<text start="1579.311" dur="3.003">The President, during his campaign said that he</text>
<text start="1582.314" dur="2.102">supported reestablishing the Glass-Steagall</text>
<text start="1584.416" dur="2.669">legislation, which would separate the investment</text>
<text start="1587.085" dur="1.368">banks form the commercial banks.</text>
<text start="1588.453" dur="2.803">There&#39;s legislation on both the House and the</text>
<text start="1591.256" dur="0.767">Senate side.</text>
<text start="1592.023" dur="1.869">It&#39;s in the Republican program.</text>
<text start="1593.892" dur="3.303">Mr. Mnuchin, when he was queried on the Hill by</text>

Senator Cantwell, who&#39;s the author of one of the
</text>
<text start="1599.831" dur="2.069">bills was a little bit more ambiguous</text>
<text start="1601.9" dur="1.234">on this issue.</text>
<text start="1603.134" dur="2.369">And I wish you could say something on where this</text>
<text start="1605.503" dur="1.702">President stands.</text>
<text start="1607.205" dur="1.668">
Mr. Spicer: Yeah, I mean I think part of the reason
</text>
<text start="1608.873" dur="1.335">
that it&#39;s-- we&#39;ve got to get -- we&#39;ve got to get a
</text>
<text start="1610.208" dur="1.735">Treasury secretary confirmed.</text>
<text start="1611.943" dur="2.503">And I think that when we sit here and get asked</text>
<text start="1614.446" dur="4.037">questions about policy and you go department after</text>
<text start="1618.483" dur="2.97">department whether it&#39;s Treasury, you know,</text>
<text start="1621.453" dur="5.505">Energy, EPA -- that -- HHS, HUD, Education.</text>
<text start="1626.958" dur="3.537">The list goes on and on and so you ask about</text>
<text start="1630.495" dur="1.802">issues and where the President&#39;s agenda is --</text>
<text start="1632.297" dur="2.069">
well, the reason that the President nominated these
</text>
<text start="1634.366" dur="1.067">highly qualified people</text>
<text start="1635.433" dur="2.002">was to implement his agenda.</text>
<text start="1637.435" dur="2.002">And Senate democrats continue to hold that up.</text>
<text start="1639.437" dur="3.003">
And I think when you wreck it, you can&#39;t -- you&#39;re
</text>
<text start="1642.44" dur="1.835">
asking us how we&#39;re going to move forward on an
</text>
<text start="1644.275" dur="1.469">agenda whether it&#39;s Glass-Steagall or so many</text>
<text start="1645.744" dur="2.669">other issues and at the same time, the Democrats</text>
<text start="1648.413" dur="2.102">are holding up the confirmation of these</text>
<text start="1650.515" dur="0.901">highly-qualified people.</text>
<text start="1651.416" dur="2.703">
Until that occurs it makes it a heck of a lot harder.
</text>
<text start="1654.119" dur="1.034">Major Garrett? Yeah?</text>
<text start="1655.153" dur="1.802">The Press: But the President still supports</text>
<text start="1656.955" dur="0.767">Glass-Steagall?</text>
<text start="1657.722" dur="1.702">Mr. Spicer: The President&#39;s position is</text>
<text start="1659.424" dur="0.701">consistent, yes.</text>
<text start="1660.125" dur="1.334">
The Press: Sean, a broad topic I&#39;d like for you to
</text>
<text start="1661.459" dur="2.97">
take on which is dissent within the administration.
</text>
<text start="1664.429" dur="1.835">
And specifically related to the President&#39;s lunch
</text>
<text start="1666.264" dur="1.101">with Rex Tillerson today.</text>
<text start="1667.365" dur="2.236">More than 1,000 employees at the State Department,</text>
<text start="1669.601" dur="1.968">Foreign Service offices, and others have signed</text>
<text start="1671.569" dur="0.835">this dissent cable.</text>
<text start="1672.404" dur="2.102">Is it the President&#39;s position that Rex</text>
<text start="1674.506" dur="1.801">Tillerson, when he is confirmed should go</text>
<text start="1676.307" dur="2.069">through the formal process, meet with those</text>
<text start="1678.376" dur="1.769">people, and have a dialog as previous</text>
<text start="1680.145" dur="1.434">secretaries of state have?</text>
<text start="1681.579" dur="1.635">
And is it the President&#39;s point of view that when
</text>
<text start="1683.214" dur="2.236">there is dissent, it can be rooted in a</text>
<text start="1685.45" dur="3.103">
philosophical disagreement that&#39;s not necessarily in
</text>
<text start="1688.553" dur="2.669">
defiance of his orders and that there can be a dialog
</text>
<text start="1691.222" dur="2.069">and that it can maybe inform him differently</text>
<text start="1693.291" dur="0.667">about policy?</text>
<text start="1693.958" dur="2.169">Mr. Spicer: Sure, I think -- I think the</text>
<text start="1696.127" dur="0.701">President&#39;s always --</text>
<text start="1696.828" dur="2.436">The Press: Because you said a couple of days ago</text>
<text start="1699.264" dur="1.201">they should get out if --</text>
<text start="1700.465" dur="0.701">Mr. Spicer: No, no, no.</text>
<text start="1701.166" dur="0.667">I think there&#39;s a difference.</text>
<text start="1701.833" dur="1.335">I think that -- just to be clear on this -- every</text>
<text start="1703.168" dur="2.002">American has a right to speak their mind.</text>
<text start="1705.17" dur="3.27">
That&#39;s one of the amazing beauties of this country.
</text>
<text start="1708.44" dur="1.735">You have the ability to write what you want</text>
<text start="1710.175" dur="1.334">through our First Amendment.</text>
<text start="1711.509" dur="2.67">
People have a right to speak out and that&#39;s not
</text>
<text start="1714.179" dur="0.667">hampered.</text>
<text start="1714.846" dur="2.169">
But, the point that I was making then is that if you
</text>
<text start="1717.015" dur="3.303">believe so deeply that the policy is offensive to</text>
<text start="1720.318" dur="2.136">you, you have to understand that the job --</text>
<text start="1722.454" dur="1.334">the way o0ur government works is we</text>
<text start="1723.788" dur="1.135">elect a President.</text>
<text start="1724.923" dur="2.669">That President gets to carry through their agenda</text>
<text start="1727.592" dur="1.668">
that they set out with the American people during the
</text>
<text start="1729.26" dur="0.668">campaign.</text>
<text start="1729.928" dur="3.837">And they have a right to express it.</text>
<text start="1733.765" dur="2.536">And I think Secretary Tillerson, for those of</text>
<text start="1736.301" dur="1.501">you who have gotten to meet him, has a very open</text>
<text start="1737.802" dur="2.102">
mind and a desire to meet with people and hear ideas
</text>
<text start="1739.904" dur="3.337">as does the President as evidenced through what he</text>
<text start="1743.241" dur="3.07">
did through the transition and what he&#39;s done since
</text>
<text start="1746.311" dur="1.101">he&#39;s become President.</text>
<text start="1747.412" dur="4.838">He has met with groups, businesses, associations</text>
<text start="1752.25" dur="2.469">-- you know, Republicans, Democrats, Independents</text>
<text start="1754.719" dur="1.835">
that have been supportive of him, that have not been
</text>
<text start="1756.554" dur="0.734">supportive of him.</text>
<text start="1757.288" dur="1.335">And I think that he&#39;s going to continue to do</text>
<text start="1758.623" dur="0.701">that.</text>
<text start="1759.324" dur="1.334">So, people have a right to speak their mind, but I</text>
<text start="1760.658" dur="4.772">
think there&#39;s a difference between expressing dissent
</text>
<text start="1765.43" dur="3.103">and concern and not implementing a lawful</text>
<text start="1768.533" dur="1.335">order as the Acting Attorney General</text>
<text start="1769.868" dur="0.8">did the other night.</text>
<text start="1770.668" dur="2.136">So, but again, I don&#39;t mean to keep</text>
<text start="1772.804" dur="1.134">coming back to this.</text>
<text start="1773.938" dur="1.468">But you&#39;re asking what we&#39;ll do when Rex</text>
<text start="1775.406" dur="2.036">Tillerson becomes -- and part of the problem right</text>
<text start="1777.442" dur="1.868">now is I can&#39;t fully answer your question</text>
<text start="1779.31" dur="2.136">because Democrats are holding up and slow</text>
<text start="1781.446" dur="1.301">walking this nomination.</text>
<text start="1782.747" dur="3.337">
So, to presuppose what Rex Tillerson&#39;s going to do,
</text>
<text start="1786.084" dur="2.102">
you know, again, I just -- it&#39;s ironic that we&#39;re
</text>
<text start="1788.186" dur="1.702">being asked what these secretaries will do when</text>
<text start="1789.888" dur="3.37">
they get into office and the Democrats won&#39;t let
</text>
<text start="1793.258" dur="0.667">them assume this.</text>
<text start="1793.925" dur="2.069">
When we all know that the votes are there for them.
</text>
<text start="1795.994" dur="1.668">The Press: I was just talking about a particular</text>
<text start="1797.662" dur="2.202">process that has historically applied in</text>
<text start="1799.864" dur="0.668">the State Department.</text>
<text start="1800.532" dur="0.667">Mr. Spicer: I understand.</text>
<text start="1801.199" dur="1.335">And I think -- but again, I think for me to</text>
<text start="1802.534" dur="1.534">presuppose what Secretary Designee Tillerson is</text>
<text start="1804.068" dur="3.537">
going to do prior to him actually getting sworn in,
</text>
<text start="1807.605" dur="2.169">I don&#39;t -- he probably will.</text>
<text start="1809.774" dur="2.636">
I don&#39;t know, but it would be irresponsible of me to
</text>
<text start="1812.41" dur="1.735">answer a question about what he&#39;s going to do</text>
<text start="1814.145" dur="1.769">before he actually becomes sworn in.</text>
<text start="1815.914" dur="1.635">The Press: Thanks, Sean.</text>
<text start="1817.549" dur="2.702">
Senate Democrats have been described as bitter over
</text>
<text start="1820.251" dur="2.77">the manner in which Judge Merrick Garland was</text>
<text start="1823.021" dur="2.736">treated when he was nominated for the Supreme</text>
<text start="1825.757" dur="0.7">Court.</text>
<text start="1826.457" dur="3.104">Do you feel -- does the President feel that that</text>
<text start="1829.561" dur="1.401">bitterness is well founded?</text>
<text start="1830.962" dur="1.735">Mr. Spicer: I don&#39;t know.</text>
<text start="1832.697" dur="1.869">I&#39;m not a Senate Democrat.</text>
<text start="1834.566" dur="2.235">I think they have a right to feel the way they do.</text>
<text start="1836.801" dur="3.504">
I think we&#39;ve explained our position both during
</text>
<text start="1840.305" dur="2.302">last year when this was going on.</text>
<text start="1842.607" dur="3.236">That we felt as though this was up to the voters</text>
<text start="1845.843" dur="0.835">to make a decision on.</text>
<text start="1846.678" dur="3.503">And as I pointed out yesterday, so many voters</text>
<text start="1850.181" dur="2.369">made up their mind based on who they believed the</text>
<text start="1852.55" dur="0.968">candidates would appoint.</text>
<text start="1853.518" dur="2.602">Mr. Trump -- then Mr. Trump -- then</text>
<text start="1856.12" dur="2.703">candidate Trump, now President Trump was very</text>
<text start="1858.823" dur="1.935">clear about the type of people that he was going</text>
<text start="1860.758" dur="3.27">
to put forth both first in a list of 10 and then in a
</text>
<text start="1864.028" dur="1.635">list of 11 additional ones.</text>
<text start="1865.663" dur="1.869">So, I think the American people knew clearly where</text>
<text start="1867.532" dur="1.101">he was going to go.</text>
<text start="1868.633" dur="2.536">He followed through on that campaign promise.</text>
<text start="1871.169" dur="1.435">And I think that when you look at the number of</text>
<text start="1872.604" dur="3.47">people who solely base their vote on that, never</text>
<text start="1876.074" dur="1.935">mind it was -- you know, and then you expand that,</text>
<text start="1878.009" dur="1.802">it was pretty clear that that was an important</text>
<text start="1879.811" dur="1.234">factor in the election.</text>
<text start="1881.045" dur="2.736">
So, I understand it, but I also think that&#39;s -- we
</text>
<text start="1883.781" dur="1.969">had an election, it was a major issue</text>
<text start="1885.75" dur="1.068">in that election.</text>
<text start="1886.818" dur="1.735">And I think that even when you look across the</text>
<text start="1888.553" dur="2.302">spectrum -- Republican, Democrat, liberal,</text>
<text start="1890.855" dur="2.803">conservative -- Judge Gorsuch has an</text>
<text start="1893.658" dur="3.17">unbelievable record and is being praised for that</text>
<text start="1896.828" dur="1.535">record because of that.</text>
<text start="1898.363" dur="3.003">
The Press: I want to ask about Friday, and there&#39;s

<text start="1913.278" dur="1.334">specifically on financial reform?</text>
<text start="1914.612" dur="1.368">Mr. Spicer: I think I&#39;ll have more --</text>
<text start="1915.98" dur="2.836">
The Press: We&#39;ve heard so much on Obamacare and tax
</text>
<text start="1918.816" dur="2.203">
reform, but it seems like financial reform has sort
</text>
<text start="1921.019" dur="0.7">of fallen by the wayside.</text>
<text start="1921.719" dur="1.335">
Mr. Spicer: Well, I don&#39;t -- I wouldn&#39;t agree with
</text>
<text start="1923.054" dur="0.667">that.</text>
<text start="1923.721" dur="1.669">
I think that when you look at regulatory reform and

<text start="1925.39" dur="2.535">tax reform and all of the steps that he&#39;s been</text>
<text start="1927.925" dur="3.838">
taking to help the economy grow and to create jobs,
</text>
<text start="1931.763" dur="1.334">that&#39;s right in that wheelhouse.</text>
<text start="1933.097" dur="1.735">I&#39;ll have -- I hope to have further updates on</text>
<text start="1934.832" dur="1.902">
the schedule for you tomorrow, but I don&#39;t now.

<text start="1938.069" dur="1.735">I have a question about foreign policy, but I</text>
<text start="1939.804" dur="1.001">wanted to follow up.</text>
<text start="1940.805" dur="2.302">You said that LPRs no longer need a waiver, but</text>
<text start="1943.107" dur="1.869">
you didn&#39;t answer the question about what about

<text start="1948.713" dur="0.701">where they came from.</text>
<text start="1949.414" dur="0.667">What happens to them?</text>
<text start="1950.081" dur="1.335">Mr. Spicer: Well, again, I think then they go</text>
<text start="1951.416" dur="0.667">through the process.</text>
<text start="1952.083" dur="2.202">It depends if they&#39;re an LPR.</text>
<text start="1954.285" dur="1.335">If not, then they go through the</text>

<text start="1980.378" dur="1.168">moving the lines forward.</text>
<text start="1982.513" dur="3.27">And I&#39;m wondering if the President feels that</text>

<text start="1988.252" dur="1.435">early in his administration before he&#39;s</text>

<text start="1992.924" dur="1.168">And what he plans to do about it?</text>
<text start="1994.092" dur="1.601">Mr. Spicer: The President has been kept aware of</text>
<text start="1995.693" dur="2.636">through his National Security Council and his</text>

<text start="2004.435" dur="0.935">The Press: During the campaign last January,</text>
<text start="2005.703" dur="75.109">
Donald Trump promised that on his first day in office

Mr. Spicer: Yeah, I&#39;ll have -- I think you&#39;ve
</text>
<text start="2018.149" dur="1.034">seen that the President has been very active in</text>
<text start="2019.55" dur="1.569">
terms of getting executive orders out and following

<text start="2021.486" dur="2.168">
up on the campaign pledges that he made the American

We&#39;re going to continue to move through this process.

<text start="2042.74" dur="1.802">I&#39;ve got a broad question.</text>

<text start="2059.29" dur="2.136">that&#39;s in fashion these days, can he tell the</text>
<text start="2061.426" dur="2.569">Forest Service to start logging out forests</text>
<text start="2063.995" dur="1.868">aggressively again to provide jobs for</text>

<text start="2072.203" dur="0.901">Mr. Spicer: Thanks, Lars.</text>
<text start="2073.104" dur="2.336">
I think the President&#39;s been very clear that as
</text>
<text start="2075.44" dur="1.468">part of an overall comprehensive energy</text>
<text start="2076.908" dur="1.568">
solution, that we&#39;ve got to utilize the resources

whether that&#39;s the forests or natural resources or
</text>
<text start="2085.383" dur="2.536">minerals that exist above and below the ground.</text>
<text start="2087.919" dur="3.436">That we have too infrequently looked at our</text>
<text start="2091.355" dur="2.603">own resources and counted too much on foreign</text>
<text start="2093.958" dur="1.969">sources of energy.</text>

So, you know, we&#39;re going to continue as Congressman

<text start="2137.902" dur="1.401">have the Congressional Bill?</text>
<text start="2139.303" dur="2.002">And why not -- I mean, what is the</text>
<text start="2141.305" dur="1.402">philosophy behind --</text>
<text start="2142.707" dur="1.101">
Mr. Spicer: Well, I don&#39;t -- I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a

area of immigration he&#39;s been very, very clear that
</text>
<text start="2151.415" dur="2.636">this is a huge priority for him.</text>
<text start="2154.051" dur="2.703">And I think that he is going to continue to look</text>

The Press: The President&#39;s top trade advisor, Peter
</text>
<text start="2186.717" dur="1.368">Navarro, told the Financial Times yesterday</text>
<text start="2188.085" dur="1.869">that he believed that the euro is grossly</text>

undervalued and Germany is benefitting from that and
</text>
<text start="2192.99" dur="2.236">
that&#39;s why we have a huge trade deficit with Germany

<text start="2196.093" dur="0.668">and with Europe.</text>
<text start="2197.328" dur="2.469">Does the President agree with that?</text>

<text start="2231.996" dur="0.567">Mr. Spicer: Sure.</text>
<text start="2232.563" dur="4.271">Look, Senator Ayotte is someone who is respected</text>
<text start="2236.834" dur="2.536">on both sides of the aisle.</text>
<text start="2239.37" dur="1.468">She has a lot of great relationships.</text>
<text start="2240.838" dur="0.968">She&#39;s a former attorney general.</text>
<text start="2241.806" dur="0.467">She understands the</text>
<text start="2242.273" dur="1.468">judicial process very well.</text>
<text start="2243.741" dur="2.202">
But she&#39;s also -- I mean, this process is a -- is a
</text>
<text start="2245.943" dur="2.569">-- is a relationship process by and far.</text>
<text start="2248.512" dur="2.203">You&#39;re going around introducing a judge,</text>
<text start="2250.715" dur="2.002">someone who has not generally been exposed to</text>
<text start="2252.717" dur="1.868">the legislative process, definitely not the</text>
<text start="2254.585" dur="1.101">Congressional process.</text>
<text start="2255.686" dur="0.901">To the --</text>
<text start="2256.587" dur="0.901">The Press: Her relationship with</text>
<text start="2257.488" dur="1.168">President Trump was</text>
<text start="2258.656" dur="1.134">strained during the campaign.</text>
<text start="2259.79" dur="1.035">She kind of walked away from him --</text>
<text start="2260.825" dur="0.433">Mr. Spicer: That&#39;s right.</text>
<text start="2261.258" dur="1.302">And I think that that goes and shows, as I&#39;ve</text>
<text start="2262.56" dur="1.368">mentioned several times both through the</text>
<text start="2263.928" dur="2.669">transition and early -- the President&#39;s not</text>
<text start="2266.597" dur="2.069">holding some kind of test about what degree of</text>
<text start="2268.666" dur="1.969">support you had for him.</text>
<text start="2270.635" dur="1.334">He wants the best and brightest to continue to</text>

<text start="2272.837" dur="1.568">whatever capacity they can.</text>
<text start="2274.405" dur="3.87">I think Senator Ayotte, very, very helpfully</text>
<text start="2278.275" dur="1.535">offered up her services.</text>
<text start="2279.81" dur="1.769">She&#39;s got a lot of relationships on both</text>

<text start="2284.348" dur="0.701">She&#39;s got a tremendous amount of experience</text>
<text start="2285.049" dur="1.301">in this field.</text>
<text start="2286.35" dur="1.635">
And I think the President thought she was extremely
</text>
<text start="2287.985" dur="2.703">qualified to do this -- to help shepherd this</text>
<text start="2290.688" dur="2.169">unbelievably qualified Justice through this</text>
<text start="2292.857" dur="0.7">process.</text>
<text start="2293.557" dur="4.405">
And so she, as well as the team that we&#39;ve gathered
</text>
<text start="2297.962" dur="2.135">of individuals on staff here, are going to help</text>
<text start="2300.097" dur="2.036">get Judge Gorsuch through the nomination process.</text>
<text start="2302.133" dur="3.069">And I would say just as a side note, that if you</text>
<text start="2305.202" dur="2.369">look at the amazing job that has been done by the</text>
<text start="2307.571" dur="2.603">team during the transition and now to get these</text>
<text start="2310.174" dur="2.336">amazing individuals through the process</text>
<text start="2312.51" dur="2.435">despite all of the hype that continues to go</text>

<text start="2315.646" dur="0.934">face this problem.&quot;</text>
<text start="2316.58" dur="1.836">Or, &quot;Which is the one person?&quot;</text>
<text start="2318.416" dur="2.235">Each of them have really sailed through this</text>
<text start="2320.651" dur="2.169">process and, you know, story after story says</text>
<text start="2322.82" dur="3.437">
Democrats tried to land a -- you know, take them out

<text start="2328.959" dur="2.036">They&#39;re unbelievably prepared.</text>

<text start="2335.7" dur="1.034">Gorsuch and I think we&#39;re going to have</text>

<text start="2383.848" dur="4.304">are being played with Betsy DeVos are sad.</text>

<text start="2429.994" dur="0.934">The Press: -- of the navy seal.</text>
<text start="2430.928" dur="1.235">Mr. Spicer: So first, I would just note, Sarah,</text>
<text start="2432.163" dur="3.603">
that I&#39;ve heard story after story in the last 40
</text>
<text start="2435.766" dur="2.903">days about how -- whether, you know, going back to</text>
<text start="2438.669" dur="1.135">the last question about these nominees</text>
<text start="2439.804" dur="1.434">not getting through.</text>
<text start="2441.238" dur="2.036">Rex Tillerson was going to go down and so-so was</text>
<text start="2443.274" dur="2.269">going to, and every one of them, after they got to</text>
<text start="2445.543" dur="2.569">
meet with senators of both sides of the party, have
</text>
<text start="2448.112" dur="3.036">shown why the President chose them because they</text>
<text start="2451.148" dur="3.404">were unbelievably qualified, unbelievably</text>
<text start="2454.552" dur="3.136">ready to lead and enact an agenda of change in the</text>
<text start="2457.688" dur="2.469">
area of responsibility that they&#39;re taking over,
</text>
<text start="2460.157" dur="1.435">and I think the same is going to be true of</text>
<text start="2461.592" dur="1.602">everyone else who is remaining.</text>
<text start="2463.194" dur="1.067">The Press: But two members of your</text>
<text start="2464.261" dur="0.701">own party disagree.</text>
<text start="2464.962" dur="2.336">Mr. Spicer: So the vote hasn&#39;t taken place.</text>
<text start="2467.298" dur="2.402">
I think we&#39;ve had some concerns in the past and I
</text>
<text start="2469.7" dur="2.136">think when these nominees have met with them and</text>
<text start="2471.836" dur="1.601">shared with them their thoughts throughout the</text>
<text start="2473.437" dur="2.202">process -- and again, you can go back, story after</text>
<text start="2475.639" dur="2.937">
story, and again each one of these folks who I&#39;ve
</text>
<text start="2478.576" dur="2.235">
heard isn&#39;t going to make it, is going to go over
</text>
<text start="2480.811" dur="1.168">the finish line each time.</text>
<text start="2481.979" dur="3.07">And I think that, you know, we hear it over and</text>
<text start="2485.049" dur="2.269">
over again and yet it&#39;s -- we succeed every time and
</text>
<text start="2487.318" dur="1.401">yet another roadblock is put up.</text>
<text start="2488.719" dur="1.568">Well, this person won&#39;t succeed.</text>
<text start="2490.287" dur="2.97">
And yet, you look at each one of these people going
</text>
<text start="2493.257" dur="2.269">
through the process and it&#39;s worked beautifully
</text>
<text start="2495.526" dur="1.234">every time, and I think we&#39;re going to</text>
<text start="2496.76" dur="0.868">continue that path.</text>
<text start="2497.628" dur="7.107">
With respect to Yemen, I think it&#39;s hard to ever
</text>
<text start="2504.735" dur="1.735">say something was successful when you</text>
<text start="2506.47" dur="2.269">lose a life.</text>
<text start="2508.739" dur="2.402">But you&#39;ve got to understand that Chief</text>
<text start="2511.141" dur="6.04">Owens, he went back, deployed 12 times because</text>
<text start="2517.181" dur="1.101">he loved this country and he believed</text>
<text start="2518.282" dur="3.937">in the mission.</text>
<text start="2522.219" dur="7.307">And knowing that we killed an estimated 14 AQAP</text>
<text start="2529.526" dur="4.772">members and that we gathered an unbelievable</text>
<text start="2534.298" dur="2.202">amount of intelligence that will prevent the</text>
<text start="2536.5" dur="3.937">potential deaths or attacks on American soil</text>
<text start="2540.437" dur="2.203">is something that I think most service members</text>
<text start="2542.64" dur="2.102">
understand that that&#39;s why they joined the service.
</text>
<text start="2544.742" dur="5.005">And so, you never want to call something a success</text>
<text start="2549.747" dur="4.237">
100 percent when someone&#39;s hurt or killed and that
</text>
<text start="2553.984" dur="2.803">was the case here, but I think that when you</text>
<text start="2556.787" dur="5.305">recognize that an individual like this loved</text>
<text start="2562.092" dur="3.07">this country so much and deployed over and over</text>
<text start="2565.162" dur="5.005">again because he knew that the mission that he was</text>
<text start="2570.167" dur="2.102">conducting was so important to our</text>
<text start="2572.269" dur="4.038">protection, our freedom, our safety, and I know</text>
<text start="2576.307" dur="3.036">when the President spoke to Karen, his wife, and</text>
<text start="2579.343" dur="3.37">talked about, you know, the three children that he</text>
<text start="2582.713" dur="3.904">
left behind, she continued to be impressed with -- to
</text>
<text start="2586.617" dur="2.269">
impress upon the President rather, that while it was
</text>
<text start="2588.886" dur="2.436">an unbelievably sad and emotional time for her and</text>
<text start="2591.322" dur="3.77">her family, that he loved doing this.</text>
<text start="2595.092" dur="4.438">
And so, you know, again I don&#39;t think you ever call
</text>
<text start="2599.53" dur="3.069">anything 100 percent success, but what he did</text>
<text start="2602.599" dur="3.003">for this nation and we got out of that mission, I</text>
<text start="2605.602" dur="1.969">think -- I truly believe and I know the President</text>
<text start="2607.571" dur="2.536">believes, is going to save American lives.</text>
<text start="2610.107" dur="2.369">With that, let me go to the last question on</text>
<text start="2612.476" dur="1.435">question on the Skype and then we&#39;ll continue.</text>
<text start="2613.911" dur="3.003">

<text start="2616.914" dur="3.336">Publishing in South Central Kentucky. Jeff.</text>
<text start="2620.25" dur="1.102">The Press: Thank you for allowing me to be part of</text>
<text start="2621.352" dur="2.235">today&#39;s White House Press Briefing.</text>
<text start="2623.587" dur="1.635">Clearly anyone paying attention will see that</text>
<text start="2625.222" dur="2.136">President Trump is aggressively acting on his</text>
<text start="2627.358" dur="1.267">campaign promises.</text>
<text start="2628.625" dur="3.204">
This in itself gives hope to my state, particularly
</text>
<text start="2631.829" dur="3.003">the region in which I grew up, Appalachia.</text>
<text start="2634.832" dur="2.869">We&#39;ve seen countless politicians make promises</text>
<text start="2637.701" dur="2.336">
at both state and national levels and not only forget
</text>
<text start="2640.037" dur="2.269">us, but to turn on us.</text>
<text start="2642.306" dur="3.336">So my question is, how soon or when will the</text>
<text start="2645.642" dur="3.304">rules restricting coal mining, coal burning, and</text>
<text start="2648.946" dur="2.502">coal exports be reversed?</text>
<text start="2651.448" dur="0.868">Thank you.</text>
<text start="2652.316" dur="1.668">Mr. Spicer: Thanks, Jeff.</text>
<text start="2653.984" dur="2.536">
I&#39;ve talked about this a couple times so far, but I
</text>
<text start="2656.52" dur="2.669">believe -- or the President has very clearly</text>
<text start="2659.189" dur="3.838">stated, that clean coal in particular is an issue</text>
<text start="2663.027" dur="4.137">
that&#39;s so important to our energy independence as
</text>
<text start="2667.164" dur="2.236">well as our job creation in this country and so</text>
<text start="2669.4" dur="1.501">whether you&#39;re talking about Kentucky or West</text>
<text start="2670.901" dur="2.236">
Virginia or Pennsylvania or so many other places in
</text>
<text start="2673.137" dur="3.503">this country that rely on coal, bringing the</text>
<text start="2676.64" dur="2.703">production of clean coal back is good for our</text>
<text start="2679.343" dur="2.903">
energy independence, it&#39;s good for our economy, it&#39;s
</text>
<text start="2682.246" dur="2.102">
good for job creation, and it&#39;s something that he
</text>
<text start="2684.348" dur="1.368">continues to talk about.</text>
<text start="2685.716" dur="4.204">And I think once we have a Secretary of Energy</text>
<text start="2689.92" dur="2.336">confirmed, that we can continue to take steps and</text>
<text start="2692.256" dur="2.235">move forward with -- Fin Gomez.</text>
<text start="2694.491" dur="0.768">The Press: Thank you.</text>
<text start="2695.259" dur="2.536">Mr. Spicer: Where&#39;s Fin?</text>
<text start="2697.795" dur="0.9">The Press: Two questions for you.</text>
<text start="2698.695" dur="2.036">After the primetime announcement last night it</text>
<text start="2700.731" dur="1.101">seems like the numbers were good.</text>
<text start="2701.832" dur="1.702">Do you have a sense that this President will be</text>
<text start="2703.534" dur="3.703">more aggressive than his predecessors on seeking</text>
<text start="2707.237" dur="5.439">
primetime air play for his announcements and two, top
</text>
<text start="2712.676" dur="1.969">Democrats are asking the defense department to</text>
<text start="2714.645" dur="3.87">
investigate Michael Flynn for possible violations of
</text>
<text start="2718.515" dur="3.17">the Constitution, do you have a -- it sounds like</text>
<text start="2721.685" dur="0.768">you saw that story.</text>
<text start="2722.453" dur="1.935">Do you have a response to that?</text>
<text start="2724.388" dur="1.601">Mr. Spicer: Yeah, I think on the air time issue,</text>
<text start="2725.989" dur="2.57">
that&#39;s something we&#39;re not particularly suffering
</text>
<text start="2728.559" dur="2.502">from when it comes to attention, and I think the</text>
<text start="2731.061" dur="3.904">President does a phenomenal job of getting</text>
<text start="2734.965" dur="1.802">attention and getting his message out.</text>
<text start="2736.767" dur="2.402">His use of social media in particular is something</text>
<text start="2739.169" dur="2.469">
that, when you look at the number of people, I think
</text>
<text start="2741.638" dur="1.936">we did something like 11 million people watching</text>
<text start="2743.574" dur="2.936">the address on Facebook Live last night.</text>
<text start="2746.51" dur="1.635">Obviously, if we have important issues to</text>
<text start="2748.145" dur="2.836">
discuss with the nation or announcements to make or
</text>
<text start="2750.981" dur="2.903">nominations, then we&#39;ll request time.</text>
<text start="2753.884" dur="1.868">
I don&#39;t think that that&#39;s something we&#39;ve spent a
</text>
<text start="2755.752" dur="1.168">ton of time figuring out.</text>
<text start="2756.92" dur="2.469">I think we&#39;re doing pretty well on that front.</text>
<text start="2759.389" dur="1.102">And then I&#39;m sorry, the second question, Mike?</text>
<text start="2760.491" dur="2.636">The Press: The request from Democrats to</text>
<text start="2763.127" dur="2.535">investigate Flynn for a possible violation of the</text>
<text start="2765.662" dur="2.136">Emoluments Clause.</text>
<text start="2767.798" dur="3.036">Mr. Spicer: Yeah, so General Flynn like, I</text>
<text start="2770.834" dur="3.871">
think probably countless if not hundreds of retired
</text>
<text start="2774.705" dur="3.303">flag officers, joined a speaking bureau and has</text>
<text start="2778.008" dur="2.603">given speeches at various places and I think that</text>
<text start="2780.611" dur="2.302">that is something that is kept in practice and the</text>
<text start="2782.913" dur="2.169">
Department of Defense is, you know, the appropriate
</text>
<text start="2785.082" dur="2.569">
place for them to review it, but as I said, I think
</text>
<text start="2787.651" dur="2.97">that when you look at so many countless retired</text>
<text start="2790.621" dur="1.968">flag officers, that&#39;s something that generally</text>
<text start="2792.589" dur="1.402">keeps with in -- Zeke.</text>
<text start="2793.991" dur="1.134">The Press: Thank you, Sean.</text>
<text start="2795.125" dur="1.802">General Flynn, when he was up here, offered some</text>
<text start="2796.927" dur="2.269">
criticism about the Obama Administration&#39;s handling
</text>
<text start="2799.196" dur="1.702">of Iran in particular.</text>
<text start="2800.898" dur="2.002">Is that something we should be expecting to</text>
<text start="2802.9" dur="1.701">hear more for this administration, whether it</text>
<text start="2804.601" dur="2.469">be on foreign policy or other issues, criticism of</text>
<text start="2807.07" dur="3.437">previous administration going forward?</text>
<text start="2810.507" dur="1.769">
Mr. Spicer: I think in areas where there&#39;s going
</text>
<text start="2812.276" dur="2.035">to be a sharp difference, particularly in national</text>
<text start="2814.311" dur="3.103">security, in contrasting the policies that this</text>
<text start="2817.414" dur="2.903">President is seeking to make the country safer,</text>
<text start="2820.317" dur="2.336">
stronger, more prosperous, he&#39;s going to draw those
</text>
<text start="2822.653" dur="3.436">distinctions and contrasts out, but in this</text>
<text start="2826.089" dur="2.937">
particular area, I think that the President when it
</text>
<text start="2829.026" dur="3.336">comes -- came to the Iran nuclear deal was very,</text>
<text start="2832.362" dur="3.804">very adamant in his opposition to the deal and</text>
<text start="2836.166" dur="1.301">to its implications.</text>
<text start="2837.467" dur="2.903">
And so, he&#39;s going to continue to make sure that
</text>
<text start="2840.37" dur="3.904">the American people know that some of these deals,</text>
<text start="2844.274" dur="2.503">you know, things that were left by the previous</text>
<text start="2846.777" dur="3.069">administration that he wants to make very clear</text>
<text start="2849.846" dur="2.236">what his position is and his opposition to them.</text>
<text start="2852.082" dur="2.669">
And you know, the action and the notice that he put
</text>
<text start="2854.751" dur="4.104">
Iran on today is something that is important because
</text>
<text start="2858.855" dur="1.502">I think the American people voted</text>
<text start="2860.357" dur="1.101">on change again.</text>
<text start="2861.458" dur="1.902">
This is another issue that he was very clear about.
</text>
<text start="2863.36" dur="1.168">So, with that, thank you guys.</text>
<text start="2864.528" dur="0.801">I&#39;ll see you tomorrow.</text>
<text start="2865.329" dur="1.268">Take care, have a good day.</text>
