"Mr. Spicer: Good afternoon, everyone.",0,4.671
Thanks for coming out to our first official,4.671,1.768
briefing here in the Brady Room.,6.439,2.002
I was going to start of a little recap of the,8.441,1.802
"inauguration, but I think we&amp;#39;ve covered",10.243,1.335
that pretty well.,11.578,0.667
"By the way, just as I get started, I know that Josh",12.245,4.238
Earnest was voted the Most Popular Press Secretary by,16.483,3.169
"the Press Corp, so after reading and checking my",19.652,2.67
"Twitter feed, I shot Josh an e-mail last night",22.322,2.736
letting him know that he can rest easy that his,25.058,2.035
title is secure for at least the next few days.,27.093,3.504
(laughter),30.597,0.667
Let me begin by saying that the President is,31.264,1.368
closely monitoring the weather in the southeast.,32.632,2.536
He spoke by phone with Governor Deal of Georgia,35.168,2.035
yesterday and offered his condolences and support.,37.203,3.504
Today President Trump is focused on fulfilling his,40.707,2.202
pledge to pursue trade policies that put,42.909,1.902
America first.,44.811,1.501
The President began his day with a breakfast,46.312,2.203
with key U.S.,48.515,0.767
business leaders where the focus of the discussion,49.282,2.402
was on job creation and,51.684,1.368
growing our manufacturing base.,53.052,2.236
Business leaders who attended included Michael,55.288,1.935

the Vice-President Chief of Staff Josh Pitcock; and,91.424,3.17
Senior Advisor Steven Miller.,94.594,2.769
The breakfast was an opportunity for the,97.363,1.902
President to hear directly from America&amp;#39;s top,99.265,2.403
business leaders about the challenges they&amp;#39;re facing,101.668,2.636
and take some suggestions about what policies and,104.304,2.435
action can be taken to help them create jobs and,106.739,3.404
grow our manufacturing base.,110.143,2.235
The meeting included a really great exchange of,112.378,1.836
"ideas, and the President has decided to reconvene",114.214,3.503
the group in a month and then have them meet on a,117.717,2.369
quarterly basis.,120.086,1.502
"As you know, the President&amp;#39;s vision is to",121.588,1.735
"create fair trade deals that create jobs, increase",123.323,2.903
"American wages, and reduce American&amp;#39;s trade deficit.",126.226,4.004
"He&amp;#39;s appointed a tough, and smart number of trade",130.23,3.236
experts who will fight on behalf of,133.466,2.369
American workers.,135.835,1.435
"With that vision in mind, the President has already",137.27,1.935
taken several steps today.,139.205,1.969
"First, he issued a Presidential Memorandum",141.174,2.669
withdrawing the United States from the,143.843,1.502
Transpacific Partnership.,145.345,1.935
TPP is a multi-lateral agreement that includes,147.28,2.636
the United States and eleven other countries.,149.916,3.036
"As the President has said many times, this type of",152.952,2.469
multi-national agreement is not in our best,155.421,2.036
"interest, and he&amp;#39;s moving quickly to advance trading",157.457,2.702
policies that increase the competitiveness of the,160.159,2.536
American worker and manufacturer.,162.695,2.603
This Executive Action ushers in a,165.298,1.568
new era of U.S.,166.866,0.834
trade policy in which the Trump administration will,167.7,2.603
pursue bi-lateral trade opportunities with allies,170.303,3.07
from around the globe.,173.373,1.334
This is a strong signal that the Trump,174.707,1.969
administration wants free and fair trade,176.676,3.136
throughout the world.,179.812,1.268
"Additionally, the President issued a",181.08,1.335
memorandum re-establishing the Mexico City Policy,182.415,2.903
stating that the United States will end the use of,185.318,2.402
taxpayer dollars to fund abortions overseas along,187.72,3.404
with coercive abortion and sterilization practices.,191.124,2.803
"Finally, the President issued a memorandum",193.927,3.169
outlining executive branch hiring.,197.096,3.003
This memorandum counters the dramatic expansion of,200.099,2.336
the federal workforce in recent years.,202.435,2.269
"IN particular, it prevents filling vacant positions",204.704,2.936
and creating new positions except when necessary to,207.64,3.003
meet national or public security responsibilities.,210.643,3.57
"It does not apply to military personnel, and it",214.213,2.77
ensures that the American taxpayers get effective,216.983,2.836
and efficient government.,219.819,2.069
"Earlier in the day, the President spoke with",221.888,1.635
"Egyptian President el-Sisi, and they",223.523,2.035
discussed ways to deepen the bi-lateral,225.558,1.869
relationship and support Egypt&amp;#39;s fight against,227.427,2.068
"terrorism and bolster Egypt&amp;#39;s homegrown,",229.495,2.203
historic economic reform program.,231.698,2.402
President Trump underscored the United,234.1,2.269
States remains strongly committed to the bilateral,236.369,2.135
"relationship, which has helped both countries",238.504,2.103
overcome challenges over decades.,240.607,3.036
The President committed to working continuing with,243.643,2.602
military assistance to Egypt and working with,246.245,2.37
Egypt to ensure that assistance most,248.615,2.002
effectively supports the Egyptian military&amp;#39;s fight,250.617,2.402
against terrorism.,253.019,1.168
The President also commended President,254.187,1.535
el-Sisi for his courageous steps to address Egypt&amp;#39;s,255.722,3.003
economic challenges and offered to discuss ways,258.725,2.602
the United States could support Egypt&amp;#39;s economic,261.327,2.202
reform program.,263.529,0.701
"Finally, the two leaders discussed a visit to the",264.23,2.736
United States in the future.,266.966,2.036

"Also, today, the President signed designations for",280.913,2.236
acting heads of executive departments and agencies,283.149,2.836
to maintain continuity in those critical positions.,285.985,3.303
"At 3 o clock, union leaders and frontline",289.288,2.536

The President has been honored to receive,349.682,1.502
tremendous support from working union men and,351.184,2.736
"women on Election Day, and he&amp;#39;s dedicated to",353.92,2.502
deepening and growing their support.,356.422,1.802
He made it a priority to meet with these union,358.224,2.369
workers on our working day one here in,360.593,2.503
the White House.,363.096,1.101
The offshoring of American jobs and lack of economic,364.197,2.435
growth in recent years has hit American workers,366.632,2.336
"particularly hard, and the President&amp;#39;s top priority",368.968,2.636
"is to retain and attract American jobs, which have",371.604,2.936
"already seen happening on his actions on Carrier,",374.54,2.836
"Sprint, General Motors, and so many more.",377.376,2.803
"At 5 o&amp;#39; clock, the President will host a",380.179,1.435

"Senate majority whip, the Senate minority leader,",388.054,2.602

The purpose of the meeting is to get the President&amp;#39;s,404.971,1.768
agenda moving through Congress.,406.739,1.735
The American people are frustrated with the lack,408.474,1.635
"of progress here in Washington, and the",410.109,1.802
President wants no delay in addressing our,411.911,1.768
pressing issues.,413.679,0.935
He&amp;#39;s taking every step and opportunity to forge,414.614,3.27
strong bonds with Congressional leaders on,417.884,2.135
both sides of the aisle.,420.019,1.535
One of the other subjects that is sure to come up is,421.554,1.668
the status of the nominees during this meeting.,423.222,2.336
It&amp;#39;s important to note that at this point in 2009,425.558,2.703
President Obama had seven of his nominees confirmed,428.261,3.336
on day one and five more in the first week.,431.597,3.437
"As it stands today, we have two.",435.034,2.035
Democrats even held up the confirmation of CIA,437.069,1.335
"Director, Mike Pompeo needlessly leaving one of",438.404,1.335
our most important national security agencies,439.739,1.334
without its top leader on day one.,441.073,1.335
It&amp;#39;s time for Senate Democrats to stop playing,442.408,1.335
political games with the core functions of,443.743,5.005
government and to allow President Trump&amp;#39;s,451.984,2.169
unquestionably qualified and talented group of,454.153,2.369
Cabinet nominees to get to work on behalf of the,456.522,2.703

Paul Ryan.,467.6,0.968
They will discuss the Republican legislative,468.568,1.735
agenda and strategy going forward.,470.303,2.068
"Early in the day, the President nominated former",472.371,2.102
"New Mexico congresswoman, Heather Wilson, as the",474.473,2.47

Air Force Academy class that included women.,482.782,3.003
She earned her Master&amp;#39;s degree and Doctoral,485.785,2.002
degrees as a Rhode&amp;#39;s Scholar in England and,487.787,2.936
then served as an Air Force officer in Europe,490.723,2.069
during the Cold War and,492.792,1.368
on the National Security Office,494.16,1.735
under President George H.W. Bush.,495.895,1.435
"As you know, we are all about big viewerships and",497.33,4.538
"large audiences here, so I want to tell you about an",501.868,2.535
effort that we&amp;#39;re undertaking here in the,504.403,1.502
press briefing room to offer up more access to a,505.905,3.036
group of journalists from around the country.,508.941,2.069
"Beginning later this week, I&amp;#39;m excited to announce",511.01,2.369
that we&amp;#39;re going to have four -- what we call --,513.379,1.468
Skype seats live here in the Briefing Room.,514.847,2.803
This will open up the briefing to journalists,517.65,1.635
who live beyond 50 miles of the Washington,519.285,2.436
D.C. area and to organizations that don&amp;#39;t&amp;#39;,521.721,2.402
currently have a hard pass.,524.123,1.535
"As always, any organization is welcome to",525.658,1.768
"apply for a day pass, but we&amp;#39;re excited to open up",527.426,3.07
into the field and fold here a diverse group of,530.496,2.469
journalists from around the country who may not,532.965,1.835
have the convenience or funding to,534.8,1.602
travel to Washington.,536.402,0.934
I think this can benefit us all by giving a,537.336,2.469
platform to voices that are not necessarily based,539.805,3.037
here in the beltway.,542.842,1.368
"Looking ahead, the President will have a",544.21,1.868

The Press: When will you,595.528,1.168
start building a border law?,596.696,1.167
Mr. Spicer: I think the President has noted that,597.863,2.603
this was a serious priority of his,600.466,1.969
throughout the campaign.,602.435,1.201
He has already started to work with Congress on the,603.636,2.235

Obamacare mandate (inaudible).,618.551,1.835

The President has made it clear that he&amp;#39;s going to,621.153,1.569
"work with Congress to, and part of the discussion",622.722,2.335
that he&amp;#39;s going to have tonight with some of these,625.057,2.436
"leaders and then again with Paul Ryan, is how we",627.493,2.769

"that the President could have taken today, he chose",638.07,3.07
to reinstate the Mexico City policy.,641.14,2.035
What message is he sending here?,643.175,2.036
Does he see the elimination or reduction,645.211,2.369
"of abortions as an American value, and also,",647.58,2.702
"here at home, can pro-life Americans expect him to",650.282,3.037

no secret that he&amp;#39;s made it very clearly that he&amp;#39;s,658.691,2.369
a pro-life President.,661.06,1.101
He wants to stand up for all Americans including,662.161,2.536
"the unborn, and I think the reinstatement of this",664.697,2.736
policy is not just something that echoes that,667.433,3.403
value but respects taxpayer funding as well,670.836,2.536
and ensures that we&amp;#39;re standing up not just for,673.372,2.403
"life, for the life of the unborn, but for also",675.775,4.137
taxpayer funds that are being spent overseas to,679.912,2.102
perform an action that is contrary to the values of,682.014,2.669

Spanish side to be back up?,711.41,1.168
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s -- okay.,712.578,1.401
Two questions.,713.979,0.901
Let me start with the latter first.,714.88,2.102
"As you know, we got the -- we hit the ground running",716.982,4.138
on day one.,721.12,0.701
"There was a lot to do, and we had done a lot of work",721.821,2.302

to get as much information up as fast as possible.,726.892,3.003
We are continuing to build out the website both in,729.895,2.136

piece by piece to get that done.,742.875,1.368
"On the (inaudible), I think the President&amp;#39;s been",744.243,2.569
clear that he was going to prioritize the areas of,746.812,3.971
"dealing with the immigration system, both",750.783,1.568
building the wall and making sure that we,752.351,1.902
address people who are in this country illegally.,754.253,2.169
"First and foremost, the President&amp;#39;s been very",756.422,1.935
clear that we need to direct agencies to focus,758.357,2.336
on those who are in this country illegally and have,760.693,2.469
a record that -- a criminal record or pose a,763.162,4.271
threat to the American people.,767.433,1.201
"That&amp;#39;s where the priority is going to be, and then",768.634,2.002
we&amp;#39;re going to continue to work through the entire,770.636,3.67
numbers that are here illegally.,774.306,1.902
"But right now, the clear focus is on that.",776.208,2.002
The Press: Sean?,778.21,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: Blake Burman, Fox.",778.878,1.368
The Press: I want to ask you two questions.,780.246,3.57
Two questions money-related.,783.816,1.702
"The President campaigned on the rate of 15 percent,",785.518,4.504
"and today, when he met with the business leaders,",790.022,1.535
he had mentioned that the tax rate would drop to,791.557,3.203
somewhere between 15 to 20 percent.,794.76,1.902
Is he moving the goal post there in any way?,796.662,3.003
And my second question is on government spending:,799.665,2.503
there have been reports that he might be looking,802.168,2.235
over ten trillion dollars over the course of ten,804.403,2.736
years.,807.139,0.667
"Is that accurate, and would you be willing to",807.806,2.37
wrap up entitlements to get there?,810.176,1.801
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think first -- well, I&amp;#39;ll take",811.977,2.303
the other one first on entitlements --,814.28,1.468
or spending.,815.748,1.101
"Look, I think you saw this with the hiring freeze.",816.849,2.836
"There&amp;#39;s been, frankly, a lack of respect for",819.685,2.135
"taxpayer dollars in this town for a long time, and",821.82,2.436
I think what the President&amp;#39;s showing,824.256,1.368
"through the hiring freeze, first and foremost today,",825.624,2.77
is that we have to respect the American taxpayer.,828.394,1.935
They&amp;#39;re sending us a ton of money.,830.329,1.335
They&amp;#39;re working real hard.,831.664,1.301
"Some people are working two, three jobs just to",832.965,1.868
"get by, and to see money get wasted in Washington",834.833,2.77
on a job that is duplicative is insulting,837.603,3.003
to the hard work that they do to pay their taxes.,840.606,2.436
And I think that that comes in to your question,843.042,3.303
in overall spending as well.,846.345,1.902
We&amp;#39;ve got to look at how we&amp;#39;re spending the,848.247,1.735
"American people&amp;#39;s tax money, and so what the",849.982,2.936
work - what the landing teams have been doing is,852.918,2.67
going into these agencies and departments and,855.588,2.836
talking about ways that we can create greater,858.424,2.235
"efficiencies, eliminate duplicity, and find",860.659,4.238
maximize the tax dollar.,864.897,2.069
So it&amp;#39;s more a question instead of just cutting.,866.966,3.003
It&amp;#39;s about how do we spend and respect the American,869.969,2.068
taxpayer dollar more going forward.,872.037,2.369
April Ryan?,874.406,1.001
The Press: And the 15 to 20 percent? Sorry.,875.407,2.937
"Mr. Spicer: Oh, I&amp;#39;m sorry.",878.344,2.002
Look - the President&amp;#39;s a very successful,880.346,1.801
businessman and negotiator.,882.147,1.702
He&amp;#39;s going to sit down and work with Congress to get,883.849,1.935
the best deal possible for American businesses so,885.784,2.67
that they can hire more people and we can,888.454,2.969
grow the economy.,891.423,1.235
So he&amp;#39;s going to work with Congress on that rate.,892.658,2.202
But he understands better than anybody how to,894.86,1.535
"negotiate a great deal, and right now, he&amp;#39;s going",896.395,2.269
to negotiate the best deal on behalf of the American,898.664,3.437
worker and on behalf of the American business that,902.101,2.169
are hiring them.,904.27,1.301
That was a lot of the focus that went on today,905.571,2.335
"talking to these companies, and it",907.906,1.469
was interesting.,909.375,0.667
The meeting was only supposed to last an hour.,910.042,1.802
"It overflowed another hour into the Oval Office, and",911.844,2.369
he kept asking them &amp;quot;what ideas do you have to,914.213,2.803
grow this economy?,917.016,1.368
What is preventing you from hiring people?,918.384,2.335
What regulations are stopping you from,920.719,3.07
conducting more business?,923.789,1.735
What are the ways that we can give you more market,925.524,2.402
"access into, you know, other countries",927.926,2.37
around the globe?&amp;quot;,930.296,1.167
And I think that&amp;#39;s what his focus is going to,931.463,1.468
continue to be is how do we create a tax and,932.931,2.636
regulatory environment that grows the economy and,935.567,2.77
"benefits the American worker, so that it&amp;#39;s not",938.337,1.702
"just about creating more jobs, but it&amp;#39;s also about",940.039,2.135
lifting up those jobs through higher wages.,942.174,2.669
April Ryan.,944.843,0.668
"The Press: Sean, I have a couple of questions if",945.511,2.836
you&amp;#39;ll allow me to take them one at a time.,948.347,2.936
Mr. Spicer: I will.,951.283,1.168
"The Press: Elijah Cummins, Maryland Cons, Democratic",952.451,2.035
"American congressman, confirmed that President",954.486,1.468
Doanld Trump talked to him about the luncheon abou,955.954,2.002
the high price of prescription drugs.,957.956,2.636
"When is this meeting going to be set, or is",960.592,2.903
it coming up soon?,963.495,1.001
And will the President be meeting with the full body,964.496,3.504
of the Congressional Black caucus as well as the,968,2.436
Hispanic caucus on issues related to,970.436,2.168
those communities?,972.604,0.735
Mr. Spicer: Okay.,973.339,1.101
Let&amp;#39;s take one at a time.,974.44,2.269
I&amp;#39;m not aware of the conversation -- I&amp;#39;m sure,976.709,2.969
you&amp;#39;ve heard the President the last couple of weeks,979.678,2.002
talk about the price of pharmaceutical drugs and,981.68,2.67
the need to get those prices down and bring,984.35,3.336
manufacturing back in the pharmaceutical industry to,987.686,2.536
benefit the country.,990.222,0.667
So it&amp;#39;s an issue that he&amp;#39;s going to continue,990.889,1.869
to work on.,992.758,0.734
"He understands, as we reform healthcare, as we",993.492,2.669
"repeal and replace Obamacare, the getting the",996.161,2.736
hold of the cost of prescription drugs to give,998.897,2.87
"more people access to them, but also to allow",1001.767,2.336
greater access in health care -- greater plans in,1004.103,2.102
healthcare -- that&amp;#39;s going to be a key part of it.,1006.205,1.701
"So he&amp;#39;s going to -- I mean, that&amp;#39;s",1007.906,1.469
going to happen.,1009.375,0.7
"I mean, look, you&amp;#39;re seeing with respect to the",1010.075,2.002
"other meetings, it&amp;#39;s day one.",1012.077,2.369
Working day one here.,1014.446,2.069
He&amp;#39;s going to start with the leadership.,1016.515,1.568
"He&amp;#39;s going to have a great conversation with them,",1018.083,2.269
but then I think you&amp;#39;re going to see a variety of,1020.352,1.735
meetings: the Congressional Black,1022.087,1.335
"caucus, the Hispanic caucus, small groups of --",1023.422,2.369
he is --.,1025.791,1.835
"You know, he&amp;#39;s someone who really enjoys that",1027.626,1.969
kind of conversation.,1029.595,0.934
I think you&amp;#39;re going to see a lot of meetings,1030.529,1.935
occur like the ones that you did today.,1032.464,2.069
"The business leaders coming in,",1034.533,1.134
these union workers.,1035.667,0.868
And it&amp;#39;s interesting.,1036.535,1.602
I&amp;#39;ve -- we -- the President was asking these,1038.137,2.469
"folks today, &amp;quot;How many of you have been in",1040.606,1.401
the Oval Office?&amp;quot;,1042.007,1.235
Three of them raised their hand.,1043.242,1.968
"We&amp;#39;ve talked to some of these union leaders, and",1045.21,1.835
"we hear, &amp;quot;WE didn&amp;#39;t get a lot of attention.&amp;quot;",1047.045,1.836
"And here we are on working day one, and yoy&amp;#39;ve got",1048.881,2.936
the President reaching out to some of America&amp;#39;s best,1051.817,2.402
"business leaders, and then some of the union workers",1054.219,2.903
and line workers and bringing them in and,1057.122,2.102
"saying, &amp;quot;I want to listen to what&amp;#39;s going on",1059.224,1.835
in your life.,1061.059,1.035
What can we be doing to help you?&amp;quot;,1062.094,2.302
And I think that you&amp;#39;re going to see a lot more of,1064.396,1.802
"that, a listening President who&amp;#39;s engaged in",1066.198,2.603
trying to figure out what policies and actions that,1068.801,2.902
"he can take, that this government can take, that",1071.703,2.369
he can work with Congress to make people&amp;#39;s lives,1074.072,2.703
"better, to make their security better, to make",1076.775,3.137
their economics security better.,1079.912,1.368
But you&amp;#39;re going to see a lot of that.,1081.28,1.701
That&amp;#39;s who he is.,1082.981,1.202
"That&amp;#39;s what he did during the transition, and I",1084.183,1.735
think that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s going to do going forward.,1085.918,1.835
He appreciates the ideas and opinions that come,1087.753,3.87
through the Oval Office or in small groups where he,1091.623,2.503
gets to share their perspective or their ideas,1094.126,2.636
or their opinions.,1096.762,0.867
I think that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s going to continue later,1097.629,1.502
this afternoon.,1099.131,0.667
The Press: I&amp;#39;m not finished.,1099.798,1.301
"Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sorry, April.",1101.099,1.435
The Press: I&amp;#39;m sorry.,1102.534,1.101
I want to go back to what the gentleman said about,1103.635,3.103
"the mandate, the New York Post gentleman.",1106.738,1.969
He said something about the Obamacare --,1108.707,2.002
now and the mandate.,1110.709,1.101
With the numbers that you talked about and has been,1111.81,2.836
in the news from Inauguration Day and the,1114.646,2.77
"numbers Saturday, do you believe that you have the",1117.416,2.502
mandate to be able to force through what you had,1119.918,4.305
talked about replacing Obamacare that really,1124.223,2.602
subsidize the whole piece of it to help low income,1126.825,4.338
people get healthcare?,1131.163,1.301
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think what we have is a mandate",1132.464,4.038
to make healthcare more accessible in lower cost.,1136.502,4.004
That&amp;#39;s what the American people were promised under,1140.506,1.634
"Obamacare, and I think it&amp;#39;s not a question about",1142.14,2.236
"a mandate, and it&amp;#39;s",1144.376,0.734
also not about forcing anything.,1145.11,1.969
It&amp;#39;s about what&amp;#39;s doing the right thing.,1147.079,1.968
It&amp;#39;s about providing people what they&amp;#39;ve been,1149.047,1.669
"promised, which is, you go around this country, and",1150.716,3.036
"you look market after market, and they&amp;#39;re",1153.752,1.368
at one plan.,1155.12,1.402
That&amp;#39;s not what the American people,1156.522,1.334
were promised.,1157.856,0.668
"Not only that, but in many cases, you&amp;#39;re seeing these",1158.524,2.002
"-- the rates go up ten, 15, 20, 30 percent.",1160.526,4.004
"That&amp;#39;s not what they were promised either, and so I",1164.53,1.901
think what the President is doing - and it&amp;#39;s not,1166.431,1.502
just -- I think he&amp;#39;s gotten bi-partisan support,1167.933,2.369
for this -- to work with Congress and to take,1170.302,2.302
executive action where necessary to implement a,1172.604,2.636
healthcare system that provides more people,1175.24,2.002
"healthcare, truly allows them to keep the doctor",1177.242,2.436
"and plan that they&amp;#39;re signing up for, lowers",1179.678,2.135
"cost, creates more competition.",1181.813,2.837
So do I think he has a mandate? Sure.,1184.65,1.968
But it&amp;#39;s not just -- it&amp;#39;s not about -- it&amp;#39;s not,1186.618,2.136
on this issue.,1188.754,0.7
I think that all leaders have a mandate for the,1189.454,2.036
American people: to fix this system and,1191.49,2.369
make it better.,1193.859,1.735
Julie Pace.,1195.594,0.667
"The Press: Sean, I&amp;#39;ve got two more (inaudible).",1196.261,3.07
There&amp;#39;s some discrepancy between what the Russian,1199.331,1.969
is saying and what the Pentagon is saying in,1201.3,2.502
terms of some potential joint action.,1203.802,1.702
Can you clarify that?,1205.504,1.101
"And, generally, is the President open to joint",1206.605,2.235
action in Syria with the Russians?,1208.84,1.669
"Mr. Spicer: On that instance, I know it&amp;#39;s",1210.509,1.835
"still dveoping, and I would refer you back to",1212.344,1.468
the Department of Defense.,1213.812,1.034
"I know that they&amp;#39;re currently monitoring this,",1214.846,3.137
"and I would refer you back to them on that,",1217.983,1.501
and I think --.,1219.484,1.402
The Press: Generally open?,1220.886,1.568
Mr. Spicer: I think that the President has been,1222.454,2.236
very clear that he&amp;#39;s going to work with any country,1224.69,1.368
"that shares our interest in defeating ISIS, not",1226.058,1.334
just on the national security front but on the,1227.392,1.335
economic front.,1228.727,0.667
If we can work with someone to create greater,1229.394,1.335
market access and spur economic growth,1230.729,1.802
and allow U.S.,1232.531,1.101
small business and companies --,1233.632,1.568
The Press: But just on this idea of doing joint,1235.2,1.769
military action with Russia and Syria --,1236.969,1.901
Mr. Spicer: I think if there&amp;#39;s a way that we can,1238.87,1.836
"combat ISIS with any country, whether it&amp;#39;s",1240.706,2.068
"Russia or anyone else, and we have a shared, national",1242.774,2.436
"interest in that, sure, we&amp;#39;ll take it.",1245.21,1.335
The Press: And then the second thing is that when,1246.545,1.334
"he was at the CIA on Saturday, he was talking",1247.879,2.169
about the U.S.,1250.048,0.768
not taking oil during the Iraq War.,1250.816,1.802
And he said that there could be another,1252.618,2.068
chance for that.,1254.686,0.768
What did he mean by that?,1255.454,1.568
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think that what the President",1257.022,2.002
has been very clear about in foreign policy is that,1259.024,2.169
too often the United States is going in with a,1261.193,2.602
"lot of money, a lot of manpower, and in many",1263.795,2.069
"cases, losing both loss of life, and we want to make",1265.864,4.371
sure that our interests are protected.,1270.235,1.335
"And so if we&amp;#39;re going into a country for a cause, I",1271.57,3.103
think he wants to make sure that America is,1274.673,1.802
getting something out of that for the commitment,1276.475,1.535
and the sacrifice that we&amp;#39;re making.,1278.01,1.334
The Press: Was he foreshadowing,1279.344,1.001
upcoming action?,1280.345,0.668
Mr. Spicer: No.,1281.013,0.667
I think he&amp;#39;s been very clear from throughout the,1281.68,2.602
campaign that he is committed to making sure,1284.282,2.703
that America -- the American people and the,1286.985,2.536
American taxpayer -- see some benefit and ensure,1289.521,2.87
that our interest overseas are not just to create,1292.391,2.969
sending blank checks.,1295.36,1.168
That we&amp;#39;re doing something that either protects,1296.528,1.435
America or is in our best interest.,1297.963,2.135
John Roberts.,1300.098,0.668
"John Roberts: Sean, a couple of",1300.766,0.667
things if I could.,1301.433,0.801
"Later this week, in his executive actions, does",1302.234,2.602
the President plan to take action to greenlight the,1304.836,3.704
keystone XL and Dakota access pipelines?,1308.54,3.937
"And on TPP, John McCain says it was a serious",1312.477,3.637
mistake to do what the President did for,1316.114,2.036
America&amp;#39;s economy and for our strategic position in,1318.15,2.035
the Asia Pacific.,1320.185,0.734
Why was TPP the right thing to do?,1320.919,2.035
Mr. Spicer: Why was it the right thing?,1322.954,2.036
John Roberts: Why was it the right thing to,1324.99,1.935
do to repeal TPP?,1326.925,1.668
Mr. Spicer: Oh.,1328.593,1.635
I think -- because I think the multiple -- when you,1330.228,3.337
"enter into these multi-national agreements,",1333.565,2.402
"you&amp;#39;re allowing any country, no matter the",1335.967,1.669
"size, any one of those 12 including us, to basically",1337.636,3.003
have the same stature as the United States,1340.639,1.768
in the agreement.,1342.407,1.235
So we&amp;#39;re basically on par with some very small,1343.642,2.669
companies who are getting access to,1346.311,1.335
an amazing market.,1347.646,1.701
The United States.,1349.347,0.801
And in return we&amp;#39;re negotiating at the lowest,1350.148,2.736
"common denominator, and I think that when you look",1352.884,2.269
"at big, multi-national agreements, multi-lateral",1355.153,2.703
"agreements, they&amp;#39;re not always in the best",1357.856,1.835
interest of the United States.,1359.691,1.502
The beautiful thing about bi-lateral agreement is,1361.193,1.935
that if any one of the two parties in the agreement,1363.128,2.402
"decides that, at any time, they want to get out of",1365.53,2.603
"the agreement, or they&amp;#39;re not being treated fairly,",1368.133,1.602
they can negotiate it much easier.,1369.735,1.368
"In a multi-national agreement,",1371.103,1.868
that&amp;#39;s not the case.,1372.971,0.901
"In many cases, all of the other countries have to",1373.872,3.07
agree to an action or to let somebody out.,1376.942,2.435
That&amp;#39;s not putting the US interest first.,1379.377,1.702
John Roberts: And the question about Keystone,1381.079,2.536
and Dakota access?,1383.615,1.101
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to get in front of the,1384.716,2.803
"President&amp;#39;s executive actions, but I will tell",1387.519,1.335
"you that areas like Dakota and the Keystone pipeline,",1388.854,1.868
"areas that we can increase jobs, increase economic",1390.722,3.47
"growth, and tap into America&amp;#39;s energy supply",1394.192,2.436
"more, that&amp;#39;s something that he has been",1396.628,2.002
very clear about.,1398.63,0.834
"I think he talked about it not only on the campaign,",1399.464,2.136
"but around the Thanksgiving period, he",1401.6,2.035
was talking about that being a big priority.,1403.635,2.169
That&amp;#39;s one of those ones where I think that the,1405.804,3.136
energy sector and our natural resources are an,1408.94,2.77
"area where I think the President is very, very",1411.71,2.135
keen on making sure that we maximize our use of,1413.845,2.937
natural resources to America&amp;#39; benefit.,1416.782,2.302
"It&amp;#39;s good for economic growth, it&amp;#39;s good for",1419.084,1.735
"jobs, and it&amp;#39;s good for American energy.",1420.819,2.502
Jonathan Karl.,1423.321,0.734
"The Press: Sean, thanks for being here, first.",1424.055,1.936
Grateful and great to see you.,1425.991,1.635
Mr. Spicer: Thank you.,1427.626,0.667
"The Press: Before I get to a policy question, just",1428.293,1.335
the question about the nature of your job.,1429.628,2.502
Is it your intention to always tell the truth from,1432.13,3.003
"that podium, and will you pledge never to knowingly",1435.133,3.504
say something that is not factual?,1438.637,2.002
Mr. Spicer: It is.,1440.639,1.368
"It&amp;#39;s an honor to do this, and yes, I believe that we",1442.007,4.437
have to be honest with the American people I think,1446.444,1.702
sometimes we can disagree with the facts.,1448.146,1.902
There are certain things that we may miss -- we may,1450.048,3.804
"not fully understand when we come out, but our",1453.852,1.568
"intention is never to lie to you , Jonathan.",1455.42,2.669
"Our job is to make sure that sometimes, and you&amp;#39;re",1458.089,2.336
in the same boat.,1460.425,0.701
"I mean, there are times when you guys tweet",1461.126,2.502
"something out or write a story, and you",1463.628,2.303
publish a correction.,1465.931,1.268
That doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you were intentionally trying,1467.199,2.135
"to deceive readers and the American people, does it?",1469.334,1.969
And I think that we should be afforded the,1471.303,1.902
same opportunity.,1473.205,1.735
There are times when we believe something to be,1474.94,2.168
"true, or we get something from an agency, or we act",1477.108,2.97
in haste because the information available,1480.078,2.402
"wasn&amp;#39;t complete, but our desire to communicate with",1482.48,2.403
the American people and make sure that you have,1484.883,1.868
"the most complete story at the time, and so we do it.",1486.751,2.803
"But, again, I think that when you look net-net,",1489.554,4.638
we&amp;#39;re going to do our best every time we can.,1494.192,2.269
I&amp;#39;m going to come out here and tell you the facts as,1496.461,1.535
"I know them, and if we make a mistake, we&amp;#39;ll do",1497.996,2.269
our best to correct it.,1500.265,1.602
But I don&amp;#39;t -- I think that it&amp;#39;s -- as I,1501.867,2.268
"mentioned the other day -- it&amp;#39;s a two-way street,",1504.135,2.203
there are many mistakes that the media,1506.338,1.334
makes all the time.,1507.672,1.769
"They misreport something, they don&amp;#39;t report",1509.441,1.835
"something, they get a fact wrong.",1511.276,1.702
"I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s always the, you know, to",1512.978,1.835
"turn around and say, &amp;quot;You were intentionally lying.&amp;quot;",1514.813,2.669
"I think we all go and try to do our best job, but",1517.482,3.103
with a degree of integrity,1520.585,2.97
in our respective industries.,1523.555,1.168
The Press: Do you have any corrections or,1524.723,1.902
clarifications you want to make (inaudible)?,1526.625,1.468
"Mr. Spicer: Sure, I mean -- well,",1528.093,1.668
"ask away, Jonathan.",1529.761,0.734
"The Press: Well, you know, just for instance, I don&amp;#39;t",1530.495,2.403
want to get into it and re-litigate it.,1532.898,1.935
Just take one issue of Metro ridership.,1534.833,1.668
Mr. Spicer: We did.,1536.501,0.968
And at the time the information that I was,1537.469,2.169
provided by the Inaugural Committee came from an,1539.638,2.302
outside agency that we reported on.,1541.94,2.269
"And I think knowing what we know now, we can tell",1544.209,2.436
that Ramada&amp;#39;s numbers are different.,1546.645,2.402
But we were trying to provide numbers that,1549.047,1.468
we were provided.,1550.515,1.602
That wasn&amp;#39;t like we made them up out of thin air.,1552.117,1.635
The Press: And do you stand by your statement,1553.752,1.668
that that was the most watched Inaugural Address?,1555.42,2.603
Mr. Spicer: Sure.,1558.023,0.667
It was the most watched Inaugural.,1558.69,1.335
Look -- when you look at just the one network alone,1560.025,3.737
got 16.9 million people online.,1563.762,3.603
Another couple of them that there were tens of,1567.365,1.535
millions that watched that online.,1568.9,1.835
"Never mind that the audience that was there,",1570.735,2.436
31 million people watched it on television.,1573.171,2.536
Combine that with the tens of millions of people that,1575.707,2.369
watched it online on a device.,1578.076,2.469
There&amp;#39;s -- it&amp;#39;s unquestionable.,1580.545,1.802
"I don&amp;#39;t, I don&amp;#39;t, and I don&amp;#39;t see any numbers that",1582.347,2.302
dispute that.,1584.649,0.901
"When you add up attendants, viewership,",1585.55,2.87
"total audience in terms of tablets, phones, on",1588.42,3.27
"television, I&amp;#39;d love to see any information that",1591.69,2.802
proves that otherwise.,1594.492,1.402
The Press: And then one other -- Mr. Spicer: Do,1595.894,2.736
you dispute that?,1598.63,0.801
"The Press: Well, I don&amp;#39;t want to get into numbers.",1599.431,2.769
"I, I --",1602.2,1.001
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I do.",1603.201,0.667
I mean --,1603.868,0.668
The Press: Okay. Okay.,1604.536,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m just saying...if you&amp;#39;re asking,1605.203,1.335
"to say, &amp;quot;If you add up the network streaming numbers,",1606.538,1.334
"Facebook, YouTube, all of the various livestreaming",1607.872,1.335
"that we have information on so far, I don&amp;#39;t think",1609.207,1.335
there&amp;#39;s any question that it was the largest watched,1610.542,5.038
Inauguration ever.&amp;quot;,1615.58,3.203
The Press: More than Ronald Regan&amp;#39;s in 1981?,1618.783,5.539
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m pretty sure that Reagan didn&amp;#39;t,1624.322,1.769
"have YouTube, Facebook, or the Internet.",1626.091,2.669
I think 41 million people watched his.,1628.76,3.503
41 million watched his.,1632.263,1.969
"So let&amp;#39;s just take the Nielson ratings, which are",1634.232,1.635
"31 million, and add it to CNN, 16.9 million.",1635.867,3.537
That&amp;#39;s a little higher.,1641.806,1.669
So I&amp;#39;m just saying - I&amp;#39;m not.,1643.475,1.401
You&amp;#39;re asking me for numbers.,1644.876,1.001
There&amp;#39;s just two entities together.,1645.877,1.735
The Press: And the approach that you took on,1647.612,2.803
"Saturday, any second thoughts on that?",1650.415,2.903
Mr. Spicer: I think.,1653.318,1.468
"Jonathan, look.",1654.786,0.667
I want this --,1655.453,0.668
The Press: The way you answered questions -,1656.121,1.334
"Mr. Spicer: I came out to read a statement,",1657.455,1.335
and I did it.,1658.79,0.667
We&amp;#39;re here today.,1659.457,0.668
"I&amp;#39;m going to stay here as long as you want, so I",1660.125,3.069
want to make sure that --,1663.194,4.705
(laughter),1667.899,0.834
I think you guys might want to leave before I do.,1668.733,1.802
"But, look, I want to make sure that we have a",1670.535,3.17
healthy relationship.,1673.705,0.667
We saw the other day that -- and I&amp;#39;m not trying to,1674.372,2.302
rehash history -- but you&amp;#39;re asking the,1676.674,1.335
"question, so I&amp;#39;m going to answer it.",1678.009,1.435
"You know, we had a Tweet go out about",1679.444,2.069
Martin Luther King.,1681.513,1.601
Think about how racially charged that is.,1683.114,3.337
And someone rushes out and says to the entire press,1686.451,2.803
corp that the President of the United States has,1689.254,3.17
removed the bust from his office.,1692.424,3.47
"Do you -- I mean, think about what this signal --",1695.894,2.502
hold on. Please.,1698.396,0.868
The Press: Did he correct himself and apologize?,1699.264,3.103
"Mr. Spicer: No, no.",1702.367,1.201
He actually prides to quote &amp;quot;my colleagues.&amp;quot;,1703.568,2.169
That&amp;#39;s the exact quote. Okay?,1705.737,1.501
"That quote, that report, got tweeted out around and",1707.238,3.771
to report where was the apology to the President,1711.009,2.669
of the United States?,1713.678,1.201
Where was the apology to millions of people who,1714.879,2.203
read that and thought how,1717.082,1.267
racially insensitive that was?,1718.349,2.336
Where was that apology?,1720.685,1.001
"The Press: You accepted his apology though, Sean.",1721.686,2.302
Mr. Spicer: Okay -- I&amp;#39;m asking where was that,1723.988,2.002
"apology, and so I&amp;#39;m just saying that when you --",1725.99,2.736
"when things like that happen, when John Lewis",1728.726,2.87
"says that he&amp;#39;s never missed an inauguration,",1731.596,4.104
and we find out he did.,1735.7,0.834
"Actually, he did under -- he skipped",1736.534,1.368
George W. Bush&amp;#39;s.,1737.902,1.835
That there are points at which we have a right to,1739.737,1.635
make sure that we correct the record.,1741.372,1.435
"I mean, you&amp;#39;re talking about integrity, and",1742.807,3.037
you&amp;#39;re talking about telling the,1745.844,1.401
truth and facts.,1747.245,1.869
I don&amp;#39;t know that it wasn&amp;#39;t malicious at all.,1749.114,1.801
And I&amp;#39;m not saying -- but there&amp;#39;s a point at which,1750.915,1.702
we have a right to go out there and correct the,1752.617,2.436
"record, and I think that over and over again, there",1755.053,2.769
is this attempt to go after this President and,1757.822,5.339
"say, &amp;quot;Well, that can&amp;#39;t be true, and that&amp;#39;s not",1763.161,1.835
"right, and the numbers wont&amp;#39; there.&amp;quot;",1764.996,1.869
And there&amp;#39;s a rush to judgment every time.,1766.865,2.669
And it&amp;#39;s a two-way straight.,1769.534,1.001
We want to have a healthy and open dialogue with the,1770.535,2.436
press corps and the American people about what,1772.971,2.269
"he&amp;#39;s doing to help this country and to unite it,",1775.24,2.435
"but at a time when he&amp;#39;s trying to unite this, and",1777.675,1.902
"he keeps talking about uniting this nation,",1779.577,2.102
"bringing people together, and then a Tweet goes out",1781.679,2.336
in a pool report to a few thousand people saying,1784.015,2.136
"that he removed the bust of Martin Luther King, how",1786.151,3.436
do you think hat goes over?,1789.587,1.201
"The Press: Sean, did the media invent the feud",1790.788,3.17
between the President,1793.958,1.936
and the intelligence community?,1795.894,1.201
Mr. Spicer: Look.,1797.095,0.667
I &amp;#39;m not -- I think that you saw from the response,1797.762,1.335
"the other day that he walked into the CIA,",1799.097,2.636
people were hooting and hollering.,1801.733,1.334
They gave him a five minute standing ovation.,1803.067,1.769
That doesn&amp;#39;t look alike a relationship that&amp;#39;s -- I,1804.836,2.135
"mean, that&amp;#39;s -- they were excited.",1806.971,2.369
But you --,1809.34,0.668
The Press: But this about media invention -,1810.008,1.368
(inaudible) --,1811.376,0.667
Mr. Spicer: But there&amp;#39;s a difference between having,1812.043,1.335
differences with intelligence leaders and,1813.378,1.568
leaders of that community who had strong differences,1814.946,2.569
with than the people and the men and women who toil,1817.515,3.203
"every single day in our intelligence community,",1820.718,2.803
and it was reflected at the CIA.,1823.521,1.568
"I mean, they came there.",1825.089,1.836
They were so excited.,1826.925,1.268
"There were 1,000 people that applied for 3-0 plus",1828.193,2.902
"seats, and we ended up taking in 400 people.",1831.095,2.97
That doesn&amp;#39;t sound like a huge feud.,1834.065,1.969
"They were excited, they were clapping, they were",1836.034,1.801
cheering when he walked in.,1837.835,1.736
And to see reports that made it sound like there,1839.571,1.701
"was some fence mending that needed to happen,",1841.272,3.003
that sure didn&amp;#39;t look that way when you walked in.,1844.275,1.669
I&amp;#39;m going to move on. Yeah?,1845.944,1.534
"The Press: Sean, can I ask what is the US strategic",1847.478,3.738
interest in moving the MUSM Embassy to Tel Aviv,1851.216,3.536
from Jerusalem?,1854.752,0.801
"And, also, in the chat with President el-Sisi",1855.553,3.137
"today, was the status of",1858.69,1.468
the Muslim Brotherhood discussed?,1860.158,1.868
Mr. Spicer: I think the readout -- I just gave you,1862.026,2.169
"the readout on the call, and I think that speaks",1864.195,2.236
"for itself what was discussed,",1866.431,3.103
"and then, I&amp;#39;m sorry.",1869.534,1.201
The first part?,1870.735,0.701
The Press: The first part -- what is the US,1871.436,1.334
strategic interest in moving the embassy --,1872.77,1.869
"Mr. Spicer: As I noted yesterday, through several",1874.639,2.369
"press inquiries, there&amp;#39;s no decisions.",1877.008,1.902
We&amp;#39;re at the very early stages of that decision,1878.91,2.703
making process. Yeah?,1881.613,1.234
"The Press: Sean, please.",1882.847,1.635
"Will there be a detailed discussion, when Prime",1884.482,3.27
"Minster May comes on Friday, of the potential",1887.752,3.37
parameters of what a trade deal might look like.,1891.122,2.436
"Is there going to be a Joint Conference, and is",1893.558,1.902
Donald Trump going to get a state visit back to the,1895.46,2.302
UK later in the year?,1897.762,1.001
Mr. Spicer: Look.,1898.763,1.201
We&amp;#39;re here on working day one.,1899.964,1.802
We&amp;#39;re excited that Prime Minister May is,1901.766,2.069
coming on Friday.,1903.835,0.834
We look forward to it.,1904.669,1.168
I&amp;#39;m sure there will be a discussion of trade.,1905.837,1.902
"The degree to which, I don&amp;#39;t know yet.",1907.739,3.169
And I&amp;#39;m sure we&amp;#39;ll have an opportunity to,1910.908,2.236
brief you out.,1913.144,0.667
I don&amp;#39;t believe we have any plans right now for a,1913.811,2.036
"joint press conference, but that&amp;#39;s something that",1915.847,1.902
our team will be working out with Prime Minister,1917.749,1.668
"May, and we&amp;#39;ll keep you updated",1919.417,2.035
on that. Yeah?,1921.452,0.701
"The Press: Sean, (inaudible)",1922.153,1.135
for American News.,1923.288,0.767
After the Executive Order was withdrawn in the US,1924.055,3.003
"from the TPP, what specific steps will",1927.058,2.803
President Trump take to expand US trade,1929.861,2.035
opportunities abroad?,1931.896,0.901
"Mr. Spicer: Well, again, I think that when he talks",1932.797,1.869
"to Prime Minister may, he&amp;#39;s going to have a great",1934.666,1.534
conversation about the potential for greater,1936.2,2.47
trade with the UK.,1938.67,1.568
I mentioned earlier that when he met with these,1940.238,3.47
"manufacturers this morning, that was right up",1943.708,2.235
there at the top of that list.,1945.943,1.402
How can we get greater market access?,1947.345,2.102
What are the specific challenges that these,1949.447,3.103
manufacturers are facing getting market access into,1952.55,2.87
countries around the globe?,1955.42,1.501
And that&amp;#39;s an important issue.,1956.921,1.135
So it&amp;#39;s not - it&amp;#39;s not just other countries but,1958.056,2.602
"within existing trade deals, we can figure out",1960.658,4.438
is there a trade dispute that can be,1965.096,1.335
"settled, the WTO.",1966.431,1.067
Is there a revision to one of the existing trade,1967.498,2.903
treaties that we have now?,1970.401,1.702
But there&amp;#39;s a lot that can be done.,1972.103,1.501
There are things that Congress can update to,1973.604,3.904
make sure that we&amp;#39;re importing and exporting,1977.508,1.702
more to benefit American businesses.,1979.21,1.335
The Press: Does he plan to talk --,1980.545,4.104
thanks. Thanks.,1984.649,1.034
"Has the President, or will the President, have a chat",1985.683,4.505
-- even an informal chat -- the Prime Minster,1990.188,2.235
before she comes here?,1992.423,1.235
Mr. Spicer: There are no plans for that now.,1993.658,1.735
It&amp;#39;s always possible.,1995.393,1.368
He&amp;#39;s been having a tremendous,1996.761,1.935
number of calls.,1998.696,1.068
I think the number is well over 80 now of people that,1999.764,2.302
"have talked to him, congratulated him.",2002.066,2.369
"Prior to being elected, he&amp;#39;s had -- we read out",2004.435,2.202
that he&amp;#39;s met with both Canada and Mexico.,2006.637,2.436
I think he&amp;#39;s talked to -- Prime Minister Netanyahu,2009.073,2.736
"yesterday, President el-Sisi today.",2011.809,2.036
I think there&amp;#39;s going to continue to be a robust,2013.845,2.002
number of world leaders.,2015.847,1.668
Mr. Spicer: To make sure that we&amp;#39;re importing and,2017.515,4.972
exporting more to benefit American businesses.,2025.089,6.14
The Press: Thanks. Thanks.,2031.229,2.636
John Christopher.,2033.865,0.967
You had (inaudible).,2034.832,0.834
Has the President or will the President have a chat,2035.666,5.473
-- even an informal chat -- with the Prime Minister,2041.139,3.67
"before, in fact, she comes here?",2044.809,1.335
Mr. Spicer: There are no plans for that now.,2046.144,1.334
It&amp;#39;s always possible.,2047.478,0.668
He&amp;#39;s been having a,2048.146,0.667
tremendous number of calls.,2048.813,0.667
I think the number is well over 80 now of people that,2049.48,1.335
"have talked to him, congratulated him prior to",2050.815,1.368
being elected.,2052.183,0.667
He&amp;#39;s had -- we ran out the other day -- he&amp;#39;s met with,2052.85,1.335
both Canada and Mexico.,2054.185,0.667
I think he&amp;#39;s talked -- Prime Minister Netanyahu,2054.852,1.335
"yesterday, President el-Sisi today.",2056.187,1.335
I think there&amp;#39;s going to continue to be a robust,2057.522,1.334
number of world leaders.,2058.856,0.668
"There&amp;#39;s a, you know, a tremendous excitement, I",2059.524,1.368
"think, in the diplomatic core and at the world",2060.892,1.334
leader level of people who are excited that President,2062.226,1.335
Trump and this administration,2063.561,0.667
want to engage.,2064.228,0.668
There&amp;#39;s a lot of times where he&amp;#39;s talking to,2064.896,1.334
"these folks and they&amp;#39;re saying, &amp;quot;I have not heard",2066.23,1.335
from anyone in years.&amp;quot;,2067.565,0.701
And I think that there is a genuine excitement to,2068.266,1.334
"reengage the United States, especially in the",2069.6,1.335
"area of trade and other economic interests, but",2070.935,1.335
also in the area of national security.,2072.27,1.334
The Press: (inaudible),2073.604,0.668
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sorry.,2074.272,0.667
The Press: Needless to say this is the big one and,2074.939,1.335
it&amp;#39;s the first special relationship.,2076.274,1.368
The Press: TPP was dead on arrival going to Congress.,2077.642,1.334
So why is this executive order anything more,2078.976,1.335
than symbolic?,2080.311,0.667
And when will President Trump start negotiating,2080.978,1.335
those bilateral deals with the 11 other countries in,2082.313,1.335
the Asia-Pacific?,2083.648,0.667
"Because it takes some time and that could be, some",2084.315,1.368
"would say, giving China, you know, room to",2085.683,1.335
make an in road.,2087.018,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Well, first I would argue that bilateral",2087.685,1.335
deals are mostly what China&amp;#39;s been engaging in,2089.02,1.334
and that&amp;#39;s something that&amp;#39;s been said that I,2090.354,1.335
"just said that we&amp;#39;re going to -- you know, the",2091.689,1.368
President&amp;#39;s going to look,2093.057,0.667
to countries to engage with.,2093.724,0.668
The Press: (inaudible) TPP countries.,2094.392,1.334
Mr. Spicer: Most of them we have existing trade,2095.726,1.335
agreements with or a good chunk of them we have,2097.061,1.335
existing trade agreements to begin with.,2098.396,1.334
This was an expansion of that and in some areas it,2099.73,1.335
"allowed, whether it was in the service industry,",2101.065,1.368
"financial services, additional market access.",2102.433,1.335
"But, I think that this is -- this is not a deal that",2103.768,1.334
was in our country&amp;#39;s best interest.,2105.102,1.335
The President could have come into office -- a,2106.437,1.335
"president could have come into office, renegotiated",2107.772,1.334
"it, and sent people back to the drawing board.",2109.106,1.369
It hadn&amp;#39;t gone to Congress yet because it,2110.475,1.334
wasn&amp;#39;t finalized.,2111.809,0.668
I think this president pulling out of the,2112.477,1.334
"agreement is not just about this one agreement,",2113.811,1.335
but I think it&amp;#39;s symbolic both here in America and,2115.146,1.335
around the world of a new era of trade policy.,2116.481,2.836
One that&amp;#39;s going to put American workers first and,2119.317,2.002
foremost and one that assures the rest of the,2121.319,3.537
world that the way that we negotiate bilateral,2124.856,2.836
agreements is going to ensure that we get,2127.692,2.302
something out of these deals.,2129.994,1.435
"As I mentioned to John a minute ago, the problem",2131.429,2.502
with multilateral agreements is that often,2133.931,2.169
we -- it becomes the lowest common denominator,2136.1,1.835
on so many things.,2137.935,1.168
For the U.S.,2139.103,0.667
what already has low tariffs and other service,2139.77,2.77
"industry benefits for countries, you know, we&amp;#39;ve",2142.54,2.97
got to make sure we&amp;#39;re going out and fighting for,2145.51,2.369
the American worker. Jennifer?,2147.879,1.134
The Press: You&amp;#39;re not going to renegotiate?,2149.013,1.802
To be clear is that what you&amp;#39;re saying?,2150.815,2.269
Mr. Spicer: We pulled out of the TPP.,2153.084,1.368
"The Press: No, but of all the existing",2154.452,1.334
deals (inaudible) --,2155.786,0.668
Mr. Spicer: We&amp;#39;ll have further updates on trade,2156.454,1.334
issues later this week.,2157.788,1.235
Jennifer?,2159.023,0.667
The Press: Does the administration feel like,2159.69,1.435
you still need an executive order to remove,2161.125,2.236
yourself from NAFTA?,2163.361,1.268
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s a great question.,2164.629,1.635
I believe there&amp;#39;s an action that has to be,2166.264,1.635
taken under the provision of NAFTA where you send,2167.899,4.27
"notice to the other countries, the other two",2172.169,2.036
countries.,2174.205,1.568
The exact nature of how that&amp;#39;s described I,2175.773,2.87
don&amp;#39;t know.,2178.643,0.667
"But it is -- there is a trigger within NAFTA, one",2179.31,2.502
of the sections allows the President of the United,2181.812,3.204
States to notify them that we intend to do that.,2185.016,2.903
The Press: (inaudible),2187.919,0.767
"Mr. Spicer: Hold on, Jennifer.",2188.686,1.335
The Press: Will there still be a North American,2190.021,2.369
trade block or something different?,2192.39,1.368
"Mr. Spicer: Again, I think part of it is he&amp;#39;s already",2193.758,2.936
spoken to both the President of Mexico and,2196.694,2.803
Prime Minister of Canada about his,2199.497,2.235
desire to renegotiate.,2201.732,2.436
And I think as he meets with both of these,2204.168,1.602
individuals over the next 30 days or so that&amp;#39;s going,2205.77,2.736
to be a topic.,2208.506,0.667
"Now, if they come in and express a willingness to",2209.173,3.637
do that you could negotiate it within the,2212.81,2.002
current parameters and update it through the,2214.812,3.403
existing structure.,2218.215,1.369
If they don&amp;#39;t and he decides to pull out then,2219.584,2.602
we would have to go back to the drawing table in,2222.186,1.635
the future. Mara? Mara.,2223.821,1.001
Mr. Spicer: I want to make sure Mara gets a,2224.822,3.403
question this time.,2228.225,1.635
The Press: Just to follow up on the China question.,2229.86,3.904
China actually has a regional agreement called,2233.764,2.67
the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and,2236.434,1.968
"now Japan and Australia, two of our great allies,",2238.402,2.937
are talking about joining that.,2241.339,1.668
Just does President Trump see a national security,2243.007,2.536
component to these trade deals?,2245.543,1.535
And is he concerned that now China will write the,2247.078,2.669
rules for Asia-Pacific trade?,2249.747,1.702
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think he has been very, very",2251.449,2.802
clear about China&amp;#39;s place in the -- in the,2254.251,4.438
geopolitical landscape both economically and,2258.689,2.436
national security-wise.,2261.125,2.236
So he understands the need -- that&amp;#39;s part of the,2263.361,2.202
reason that trade is important --,2265.563,1.468
bilateral trade.,2267.031,1.201
It provides a check on a lot of this.,2268.232,1.668
"But again, he&amp;#39;s always going to be fighting for",2269.9,3.104
the interest of the country and the,2273.004,1.334
American worker.,2274.338,0.668
So how we engage and with whom is going to be,2275.006,3.403
decided on whether or whether not we can get a,2278.409,1.335
deal that benefits our country economically and,2279.744,3.103
in terms of national security.,2282.847,1.568
That there are things that we can do economically,2284.415,2.469
that actually end up also benefitting us from a,2286.884,4.371
national security standpoint because of the,2291.255,2.069
economic relationship that exists between,2293.324,2.035
the two countries.,2295.359,0.734
"Yes, sir.",2296.093,0.701
The Press: Can I follow up on another?,2296.794,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: Okay, Mara gets a follow up?",2298.129,1.334
The Press: I&amp;#39;m sorry.,2299.463,0.701
Thank you.,2300.164,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: No, you earned it.",2300.831,0.801
The Press: Just really simple -- what is the,2301.632,2.569
average national unemployment rate?,2304.201,1.335
Mr. Spicer: What&amp;#39;s the average?,2305.536,0.701
"The Press: No, I mean what&amp;#39;s the overall",2306.237,1.835
unemployment rate today?,2308.072,0.701
Mr. Spicer: Are you talking about whether or,2308.773,1.334
not we include the full --,2310.107,1.402
The Press: I&amp;#39;m just asking.,2311.509,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I mean the Bureau of Labor statistics,2312.176,1.602
puts it at --,2313.778,1.001
The Press: You accept the --,2314.779,1.935
"Mr. Spicer: No, it&amp;#39;s not a question of what I accept.",2316.714,2.235
"I mean, there are ways that you can put out",2318.949,1.368
full employment --,2320.317,0.668
The Press: I know the difference.,2320.985,1.334
"Mr. Spicer: Right, but I&amp;#39;m saying -- so there&amp;#39;s a",2322.319,1.335
reason that we put out several versions of that.,2323.654,1.335
One is that it -- the illustrative nature of how,2324.989,2.602
"you count the unemployed, whether or not they&amp;#39;re",2327.591,2.269
"long-term unemployed, or whether or not they&amp;#39;re",2329.86,1.969
still seeking a job.,2331.829,1.501
But there&amp;#39;s a reason that you put out several of,2333.33,1.635
these statistics.,2334.965,0.701
It&amp;#39;s so that economists can view them and decide,2335.666,2.903
-- look at different landscapes on how to make,2338.569,4.004
economic policy.,2342.573,0.868
The Press: (inaudible) during the campaign he had,2343.441,1.568
at one point -- Trump at one point said that it,2345.009,1.668
was 42 percent.,2346.677,0.667
I just want to be clear on where we&amp;#39;re starting.,2347.344,2.336
"Mr. Spicer: But again -- but again, part of it is",2349.68,1.335
his economic team is going to look at a multitude of,2351.015,1.702
statistics and drive economic policies.,2352.717,2.102
His goal is obviously to get as many Americans,2354.819,1.902
working together.,2356.721,0.934
That&amp;#39;s his ultimate goal -- is that when he sees,2357.655,2.202
people that are hurting that haven&amp;#39;t had wages,2359.857,2.069
"lifted up, that are unemployed, that can&amp;#39;t",2361.926,2.469
"save for their kid&amp;#39;s future, that are having",2364.395,2.536
trouble with their healthcare costs -- that&amp;#39;s,2366.931,1.401
what he really cares about.,2368.332,1.268
It&amp;#39;s not just a number to him.,2369.6,1.435
It&amp;#39;s about -- it&amp;#39;s someone getting by.,2371.035,2.469
Are their wages going up?,2373.504,1.301
Can they find a better job?,2374.805,1.602
Do they have access to education whether it&amp;#39;s,2376.407,2.669
"higher education, college, or a voc-technical kind",2379.076,3.27
of school?,2382.346,0.667
So that they can train for the skills of the,2383.013,1.936
next century.,2384.949,0.667
Those are the kind of things the President --,2385.616,2.97
he&amp;#39;s not focused on statistics as much as he,2388.586,2.702
is on whether or not the American people are doing,2391.288,2.369
better as a whole and whether or not a family.,2393.657,1.969
And it was interesting.,2395.626,0.834
I know when we talked about Carrier at one point,2396.46,1.669
"or something -- well, that&amp;#39;s 1,000 jobs.",2398.129,1.501
"When you talk about those 1,000 jobs and their",2399.63,2.102
families -- during the holiday season I would beg,2401.732,2.936
to differ that those people were unbelievably,2404.668,2.336
ecstatic that the President and the Vice,2407.004,1.969
President intervened.,2408.973,1.401
"And so, every one of these meetings that you saw",2410.374,2.269
happen at Trump Tower and then now -- it&amp;#39;s all,2412.643,2.736
"about, you know, whether it&amp;#39;s 2,000 jobs or",2415.379,2.069
"20,000 jobs.",2417.448,1.868
That&amp;#39;s the focus.,2419.316,1.602
It&amp;#39;s making sure that we have -- that small,2420.918,2.169
businesses have greater opportunity to be,2423.087,2.135
"successful, that American workers can have their",2425.222,1.835
"wages lifted up, that the benefits that they receive",2427.057,2.737
in terms of healthcare and education are something,2429.794,2.402
that provide them the support that they need.,2432.196,2.769
Because that&amp;#39;s what this is all about.,2434.965,2.002
I think for too often in Washington we get our,2436.967,1.602
heads wrapped around a number and a statistic and,2438.569,2.803
we look at and we forget the faces and the families,2441.372,2.702
and the businesses that are behind those numbers.,2444.074,2.47
And so I think that&amp;#39;s where his head&amp;#39;s at -- is,2446.544,2.335
trying to look at those people that come to his,2448.879,1.702
"rallies, that have come to his events, that he&amp;#39;s met",2450.581,1.835
"with in person that are struggling and say, &amp;quot;Mr.",2452.416,2.369
"Trump, I&amp;#39;m working as hard as I can.",2454.785,2.603
I&amp;#39;m working two jobs.,2457.388,1.501
I&amp;#39;m doing everything by the rules and I keep,2458.889,2.336
getting screwed.&amp;quot;,2461.225,1.335
That&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s fighting for is that man or woman,2462.56,2.202
"out there that&amp;#39;s doing everything they can right,",2464.762,3.336
but can&amp;#39;t catch a break.,2468.098,1.602
And I think he addressed that in his inaugural,2469.7,1.768
speech when he talked about shifting power,2471.468,2.336
"outside of Washington, D.C. back to",2473.804,2.169
the American people.,2475.973,1.301
"Because for too long it&amp;#39;s been about stats, Mara.",2477.274,2.269
And it&amp;#39;s been about what number are we looking at,2479.543,2.169
as opposed to what face are we looking at.,2481.712,1.902
Yeah. David.,2483.614,0.734
The Press: I have two questions.,2484.348,2.135
"One on -- back on DACA, I was just curious about the",2486.483,2.269
message from this administration from the,2488.752,1.368
White House to young people who may qualify and,2490.12,2.937
not yet have the protection should they,2493.057,1.468
enroll going forward?,2494.525,2.836
And those who are in the program now seek renewal?,2497.361,2.336
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think -- yeah, what those people",2499.697,3.203
should know is that the President&amp;#39;s laid out a,2502.9,1.835
list of priorities.,2504.735,0.801
And the priorities are focused on making sure,2505.536,3.003
that people who can do harm or have done harm and,2508.539,2.736
have a criminal record are the focus.,2511.275,2.069
"And as he said throughout the campaign, we&amp;#39;ve got a",2513.344,2.502
series of individuals who we&amp;#39;ve got to figure out --,2515.846,2.069
"people who have overstayed their Visas, people who",2517.915,1.635
have committed crime.,2519.55,0.667
And we&amp;#39;re going to go through that in a very,2520.217,1.635
systematic and methodical way.,2521.852,1.835
So for now that&amp;#39;s not -- the focus is going to be,2523.687,2.536
on people who&amp;#39;ve done,2526.223,1.035
harm to our country. Yes.,2527.258,1.001
The Press: (inaudible) 2016 was the hottest year,2528.259,2.936
on record and the last three years have been the,2531.195,3.103
hottest on record.,2534.298,0.934
Scientists are saying that we&amp;#39;re getting dangerously,2535.232,2.169
close to the point where human civilization is,2537.401,2.469
being threatened.,2539.87,0.667
How does President Trump plan to address this?,2540.537,2.436
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think -- I think he&amp;#39;s going to",2542.973,2.569
meet with his team and figure out what policies,2545.542,2.737
are best for the environment.,2548.279,2.035
But I think that there&amp;#39;s -- one of the things that,2550.314,2.069
he talked about during the campaign is there is a,2552.383,1.935
balance and he&amp;#39;s trying to make sure we use our,2554.318,2.469
"resources appropriately, that we maximize things to",2556.787,3.036
make sure that we don&amp;#39;t do so at the detriment of,2559.823,2.036
economic growth and job creation.,2561.859,2.069
So there&amp;#39;s a balance and I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s an either,2563.928,1.701
or situation.,2565.629,1.302
We can ensure that we&amp;#39;re doing things that are,2566.931,1.534
smart for the environment and smart for our,2568.465,2.203
longevity as well as making sure that we&amp;#39;re,2570.668,2.302
doing things that create economic growth and,2572.97,2.436
"job creation. Yes, sir. Yeah.",2575.406,1.034
"The Press: Sean, what is the President&amp;#39;s message to",2576.44,3.103
the millions of people here in Washington and,2579.543,2.202
around the country who were protesting on,2581.745,2.236
Saturday?,2583.981,0.667
And a follow up after that.,2584.648,1.869
Mr. Spicer: Okay.,2586.517,1.134
That is very polite of you.,2587.651,0.934
I think he has a healthy respect for the First,2588.585,3.904
"Amendment and he -- this is, you know, this is what",2592.489,4.338
makes our country so beautiful.,2596.827,1.735
Is that on one day you can inaugurate a President.,2598.562,1.835
On the next day people can occupy the same space to,2600.397,3.07
protest something.,2603.467,0.767
But he&amp;#39;s also cognizant to the fact that a lot of,2604.234,3.504
these people were there to protest an issue of,2607.738,3.503
concern to them and not against anything.,2611.241,1.969
I remember -- this morning Debbie Dingle was on,2613.21,3.103
"television and, you know, she&amp;#39;s talking about -- let",2616.313,2.169
me just -- I don&amp;#39;t want to inaccurately quote her.,2618.482,2.169
I know Jonathan&amp;#39;s a stickler for that.,2620.651,2.002
(laughter),2622.653,0.667
"She said, &amp;quot;Different women were there for different",2623.32,2.736
"reasons, but they were all there to make sure that",2626.056,1.835
their core American values are going to be protected.,2627.891,2.036
And I think many people like me were there for,2629.927,2.769
positive reasons.&amp;quot;,2632.696,0.768
And I think the President shares Debbie Dingle&amp;#39;s,2633.464,2.302
views that there were people that came to the,2635.766,1.835
mall as they do all the time.,2637.601,2.302
Sometimes in smaller numbers and --,2639.903,1.936
(inaudible),2641.839,0.667
I think he reaches out to them in the way that he,2642.506,2.436
"started on the night that he won the election, on",2644.942,2.803
the way that he did on inauguration day by,2647.745,2.669
sending a message that talks about,2650.414,1.501
fighting for them.,2651.915,1.001
But more importantly I think the President&amp;#39;s,2652.916,1.702
going to show through action and through success,2654.618,2.035
that he&amp;#39;s fighting for them and fighting for,2656.653,2.136
every American.,2658.789,1.268
One of the things that we&amp;#39;ve seen so often in,2660.057,2.536
this town is a lot of soaring rhetoric about how,2662.593,2.402
much people care.,2664.995,0.868
And I think the President is going to show through,2665.863,2.402
deed and action and success that he wants to,2668.265,2.97
"fight for people&amp;#39;s healthcare, he wants to",2671.235,2.435
"have a better education system, he wants a",2673.67,2.069
stronger America.,2675.739,0.901
He wants to go in and fix our inner cities.,2676.64,2.569
"He wants to make sure that our infrastructure, our",2679.209,1.936
roads and our bridges -- so I think more than,2681.145,2.202
anything showing people through action and deed,2683.347,2.602
and success is where he&amp;#39;s going to prove to the,2685.949,1.936
American people how much he cares to unite us and,2687.885,3.17
how much he cares to make this America better,2691.055,2.402
and safer. Yeah?,2693.457,0.934
"The Press: On the other side of this, another",2694.391,2.436
group that&amp;#39;s coming to Washington --,2696.827,1.802
"Mr. Spicer: I forgot, you did ask.",2698.629,1.334
"The Press: I did, thank you for remembering.",2699.963,1.502
Another group -- and this is a follow up on CBN&amp;#39;s,2701.465,2.102
question a moment ago.,2703.567,0.734
"You know, when we have the March for Life here in",2704.301,2.569
"Washington, you&amp;#39;ve said that this is",2706.87,1.802
pro-life president.,2708.672,0.667
What concrete promises is he making?,2709.339,2.103
We haven&amp;#39;t heard a lot about what that policy is,2711.442,3.036
going to look like.,2714.478,1.001
Mr. Spicer: It&amp;#39;s day one.,2715.479,1.068
"The Press: Yeah, but you&amp;#39;ve had a lot of time",2716.547,1.334
to make those promises.,2717.881,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: I know, but I think --",2718.549,1.501
The Press: What should their expectations be?,2720.05,1.835
Mr. Spicer: Their expectations should be,2721.885,1.402
that he&amp;#39;s going to stand up and value life,2723.287,2.435
born or unborn.,2725.722,1.302
Same as he said throughout the last year and a half.,2727.024,2.569
"That he&amp;#39;s going to stand up and protect life,",2729.593,1.568
"promote it, and instill policies that promote",2731.161,3.57
"life, that promote adoption, that help",2734.731,1.936
"support young women, that help support funding of",2736.667,3.57
agencies and clinics that support women&amp;#39;s health.,2740.237,3.503
I think that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s going to talk about is,2743.74,1.669
"supporting all of life -- the born, the unborn.",2745.409,2.969
Throughout life making sure that we have,2748.378,1.569
healthcare that can support the American,2749.947,2.502
people and American families.,2752.449,1.902
That&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s going to fight for and that&amp;#39;s what,2754.351,1.802
he&amp;#39;s going to be clear on. Anita?,2756.153,1.335
The Press: I have two questions.,2757.488,1.635
Mr. Spicer: Okay.,2759.123,0.934
The Press: I&amp;#39;m putting it out there right now.,2760.057,2.836
The first one with the Congressional meeting,2762.893,2.202
"today and also at the retreat, you said talking",2765.095,2.803
about his legislative agenda.,2767.898,1.268
"Besides healthcare, can you give us one, two, or",2769.166,2.836
three legislative things that he wants to get,2772.002,2.002
through right away?,2774.004,0.968
"So not the executive actions, legislation.",2774.972,1.935
Mr. Spicer: Right.,2776.907,0.968
Immigration&amp;#39;s obviously going to be high,2777.875,1.968
on that list.,2779.843,0.968
"Tax reform, regulatory reform is three and four.",2780.811,2.569
The Press: Immigration is not an overhaul though.,2783.38,3.504
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think he&amp;#39;s going to work with",2786.884,1.334
Congress to get the,2788.218,0.668
appropriations process going.,2788.886,1.568
But it&amp;#39;s not -- it&amp;#39;s not just building the wall.,2790.454,2.169
That&amp;#39;s through the appropriations process.,2792.623,1.368
It&amp;#39;s how do we enact policies to make sure that,2793.991,3.503
what we have now doesn&amp;#39;t happen again?,2797.494,2.036
And so it&amp;#39;s -- it is -- it is working with them.,2799.53,2.202
It&amp;#39;s a comprehensive look at how we&amp;#39;re keeping,2801.732,3.136
"people out of this country that shouldn&amp;#39;t be here,",2804.868,2.403
that people who are coming to visit are leaving when,2807.271,1.635
"they&amp;#39;re supposed to, to make sure that we&amp;#39;re",2808.906,2.068
"tailoring immigration policies, that make sure",2810.974,2.87
"we&amp;#39;re not, you know, an open door for just anyone",2813.844,2.936
"to walk in, that the people who are here to",2816.78,1.335
visit our country safely or who come here to bring,2818.115,2.302
jobs or to support our economy are coming in.,2820.417,2.503
But I think we have to do immigration smartly and,2822.92,1.735
that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s looking at.,2824.655,1.034
The Press: And then I had a second one.,2825.689,2.336
"Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sorry, you&amp;#39;re right.",2828.025,1.568
The Press: I haven&amp;#39;t heard that you all -- you have,2829.593,2.803
said or someone else has said specifically -- will,2832.396,2.702
the President -- has the President spoken to any of,2835.098,3.037
the intelligence agencies about the investigation,2838.135,1.835
into the Russian connections?,2839.97,1.235
And will he allow that to go on?,2841.205,2.435
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t believe he has spoken to,2843.64,1.936
anyone specifically about that and I don&amp;#39;t know that,2845.576,2.402
we -- he has not made any indication that he would,2847.978,2.035
stop an investigation of any sort.,2850.013,1.669
"Yes, sir?",2851.682,0.667
The Press: Thanks.,2852.349,0.701
Just a clarification -- you said you&amp;#39;re willing to,2853.05,2.068
work with anybody to defeat the,2855.118,2.136
Islamic State group.,2857.254,1.301
Does that include Bashar al-Assad?,2858.555,1.568
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think -- I think what it&amp;#39;s going",2860.123,2.87
-- what we&amp;#39;re doing -- we&amp;#39;re -- we are going to,2862.993,2.135
smartly do this.,2865.128,1.168
"I mean, let&amp;#39;s be clear.",2866.296,0.834
Part of it is to make sure that they have America&amp;#39;s,2867.13,1.869
interest in what they&amp;#39;re doing and who they are.,2868.999,2.903
So we&amp;#39;re not going to get together with people under,2871.902,1.935
the guise of defeating ISIS if that&amp;#39;s not truly,2873.837,2.136
their guise or if they&amp;#39;re not -- so let&amp;#39;s not take,2875.973,4.304
that too far.,2880.277,0.901
Thank you. Yeah.,2881.178,0.734
"The Press: Sean, will the President release",2881.912,2.269
documents showing that he has left his businesses?,2884.181,2.569
Mr. Spicer: I believe we have.,2886.75,1.435
The Press: They&amp;#39;re not public at this time.,2888.185,3.637
"Mr. Spicer: But yeah, he has resigned from the",2891.822,2.469
company as he said he would before,2894.291,2.202
he took office.,2896.493,0.901
Don and Eric are fully in charge of the company.,2897.394,2.936
He&amp;#39;s taken extraordinary steps to ensure that,2900.33,2.002
that&amp;#39;s happened. Yeah?,2902.332,1.368
The Press: The President is (inaudible) alignment,2903.7,4.038
to the political priorities.,2907.738,2.435
What would be the message for the Hispanic community,2910.173,2.97
in the U.S.,2913.143,1.668
taking into consideration one of the priorities has,2914.811,2.803
been the wall.,2917.614,0.701
What would be the relation between this,2918.315,3.57
administration and the Hispanic community,2921.885,3.47
in the U.S.?,2925.355,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think his relationship with the",2926.023,1.668
Hispanic community is going to be great.,2927.691,1.335
"I think he&amp;#39;s -- as I said, I think that whether it&amp;#39;s",2929.026,2.769
jobs or education or healthcare the President&amp;#39;s,2931.795,2.569
committed to uniting all Americans and working,2934.364,2.97
"towards a better, safer, more secure, more",2937.334,2.936
prosperous America that benefits everybody.,2940.27,2.302
"And I think, you know, whether -- regardless of",2942.572,2.169
your background that&amp;#39;s something that he&amp;#39;s,2944.741,2.136
committed to. Yeah?,2946.877,0.667
The Press: Does Mr. Trump agree with Rex Tillerson,2947.544,4.271
that the U.S.,2951.815,0.667
should try and prevent China from accessing the,2952.482,2.503
islands in the South China Sea where it&amp;#39;s building,2954.985,2.002
runways and other kinds of facilities?,2956.987,1.902
Mr. Spicer: I think areas in the South China Sea,2958.889,2.235
that are part of international waters and,2961.124,2.002
international activities -- I think the U.S.,2963.126,1.535
is going to make sure that we protect our,2964.661,1.335
interests there.,2965.996,0.667
"So it&amp;#39;s a question of if those islands are, in",2966.663,4.271
"fact, in international waters and not part of",2970.934,2.403
"China proper then yeah, we&amp;#39;re going to make sure",2973.337,1.601
that we defend international territories,2974.938,3.27
from being taken over by one country.,2978.208,1.535
Does that answer?,2979.743,1.301
The Press: Would you prevent China from,2981.044,1.368
actually reaching those islands?,2982.412,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to -- look, I&amp;#39;m not -- I",2983.747,1.835
think I answered the question.,2985.582,1.034
I think as we develop further we&amp;#39;ll have more,2986.616,2.036
information on that.,2988.652,0.667
John Gizzi?,2989.319,0.667
The Press: Thank you Sean.,2989.986,1.202
Thank you Sean.,2991.188,0.934
"Mr. Spicer: Hold on, I&amp;#39;ll get to you, I promise.",2992.122,1.768
The Press: And welcome to your first day on the job.,2993.89,3.404
Mr. Spicer: Thank you.,2997.294,1.568
"The Press: Very simply, there was an earlier",2998.862,3.003
question about Jerusalem and the U.S.,3001.865,2.269
Embassy there and a lot of talk about,3004.134,2.102
executive orders.,3006.236,0.767
Is this something the President can accomplish,3007.003,3.204
by executive order?,3010.207,1.368
"Mr. Spicer: It is, but I think as I noted, John,",3011.575,2.602
it&amp;#39;s very early in this process.,3014.177,1.702
We&amp;#39;re at the beginning stages of this decision,3015.879,1.869
making process and his team&amp;#39;s going to continue,3017.748,2.535
to consult with stakeholders as,3020.283,1.202
we get there.,3021.485,0.7
"Yes, ma&amp;#39;am?",3022.185,0.668
The Press: (inaudible).,3022.853,0.667
"Thank you, Sean.",3023.52,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Of course.,3024.187,0.668
The Press: And welcome here.,3024.855,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Thank you.,3025.522,0.667
The Press: So I have a follow up on the,3026.189,1.468
housekeeping question about NAFTA.,3027.657,1.769
Are we not to expect then an executive order today,3029.426,2.97
to renegotiate NAFTA?,3032.396,1.368
Or will he wait till he meets with President Pena,3033.764,2.902
Nieto next week?,3036.666,1.202
And on the other -- the other question I had is he,3037.868,3.27
"didn&amp;#39;t mention Latin America at all in his, you",3041.138,2.569
"know, in his inauguration speech.",3043.707,2.869
Does he plan to visit Latin America this year?,3046.576,2.169
"Mr. Spicer: So, on the first part I think we&amp;#39;ll",3048.745,3.604
have further announcements on trade,3052.349,1.935
throughout the week.,3054.284,0.701
The Press: It&amp;#39;s not going to happen today.,3054.985,1.401
Mr. Spicer: I think we&amp;#39;re done with executive orders,3056.386,1.869
"for the day, but as I always say, stand by.",3058.255,3.637
But we do not have any intention to have,3061.892,2.402
additional executive orders today.,3064.294,1.902
But I believe there could be some additional ones,3066.196,2.269
throughout the week on trade and we&amp;#39;ll have,3068.465,2.135
further updates for you on there.,3070.6,1.769
And then the second part?,3072.369,1.101
The Press: If he plans to travel to Latin America,3073.47,2.035
given that he left them,3075.505,1.602
out of his inauguration speech.,3077.107,1.234
Mr. Spicer: Right.,3078.341,0.668
"Well, I don&amp;#39;t think he -- I don&amp;#39;t think he",3079.009,2.402
left them out.,3081.411,0.801
"I think he was focused on this country,",3082.212,2.069
our American workers.,3084.281,1.801
I don&amp;#39;t think he got into detail on any countries,3086.082,2.236
that I&amp;#39;m aware of or that I can recall.,3088.318,2.936
But I also think that we&amp;#39;re here on the first,3091.254,2.836
working day.,3094.09,1.035
We&amp;#39;re announcing Theresa May coming this Friday.,3095.125,2.502
We&amp;#39;re excited to have the prime minister here.,3097.627,2.102
"As I said, we&amp;#39;ve already talked about setting up a",3099.729,2.369
meeting with Canada and Mexico.,3102.098,2.036
He&amp;#39;s talked to Prime Minister Netanyahu about,3104.134,2.002
having him come over.,3106.136,1.568
"And then as I mentioned, President el-Sisi.",3107.704,2.069
So we&amp;#39;ll get there.,3109.773,1.501
We&amp;#39;ve got a lot of calls to return.,3111.274,1.802
There&amp;#39;s a lot of excitement throughout the,3113.076,1.335
"world, and a lot of people who are really excited",3114.411,2.269
both to come here and have the President visit them.,3116.68,2.769
"Yes, sir?",3119.449,0.667
"The Press: Sir, last week on LGBT rights, the Log",3120.116,3.07
Cabin republicans -- a gay republican group --,3123.186,2.87
delivered a white paper to the Trump team urging the,3126.056,3.67
President to maintain an executive order from,3129.726,2.569
President Obama barring anti-LGBT workplace,3132.295,1.835
discrimination among federal contractors.,3134.13,1.469
The President has said he&amp;#39;s going to rescind the,3135.599,1.902
executive orders from President Obama that are,3137.501,1.868
"unconstitutional, but will he maintain this executive",3139.369,1.969
order barring anti-LGBT?,3141.338,1.301
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know on that one.,3142.639,1.635
I&amp;#39;ll have to get back to you on that one.,3144.274,1.368
I don&amp;#39;t know that we&amp;#39;ve gotten that far in the,3145.642,1.835
"list of executive orders, but I&amp;#39;ll be glad to get",3147.477,1.535
back to you.,3149.012,0.667
The Press: The President won&amp;#39;t rescind them?,3149.679,1.335
Mr. Spicer: What&amp;#39;s that?,3151.014,0.667
"Again, it&amp;#39;s not -- I just don&amp;#39;t know the answer.",3151.681,1.635
I&amp;#39;ll try to get back to you on that one.,3153.316,1.969
"Yes, sir?",3155.285,0.767
The Press: Two quick things.,3156.052,1.902
"One immigration, the Chief of Staff, I think, had",3157.954,3.437
said over the weekend -- seemed to suggest that an,3161.391,3.837
executive order shutting down the DACA program has,3165.228,2.503
been ruled out.,3167.731,0.901
Is that officially ruled out as you guys,3168.632,2.435
go forward?,3171.067,0.668
And does the -- and does the President support,3171.735,2.669
action in Congress that would essentially,3174.404,1.835
permanently establish those protections,3176.239,1.335
for those --,3177.574,0.801
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, I think I don&amp;#39;t have anything",3178.375,2.869
"further on the executive action front, but what I",3181.244,1.568
can -- I think I&amp;#39;ve asked and answered the DACA,3182.812,2.77
piece of this in terms of his priorities right now.,3185.582,1.935
The Press: Does he support a legislation?,3187.517,1.335
Mr. Spicer: I think that we&amp;#39;ll have to -- we don&amp;#39;t,3188.852,1.902
have anything in front of us right now,3190.754,1.701
to sign on that.,3192.455,1.102
So give us a little bit of time.,3193.557,1.768
We&amp;#39;ll see what Congress moves forward with and,3195.325,1.902
then I&amp;#39;m sure we&amp;#39;ll have a further read out on both,3197.227,1.535
the executive order piece and on the legislation.,3198.762,2.302
"Yes, sir?",3201.064,0.667
The Press: What is the status of the refugee,3201.731,1.869
resettlement program?,3203.6,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know.,3204.267,0.934
I&amp;#39;ll have to get back to you on that one right now.,3205.201,1.736
Or I think the best thing to do would probably be,3206.937,1.635
contact the Department of State.,3208.572,1.434
"Yes, sir, in the back?",3210.006,0.668
The Press: Regarding access for American,3210.674,2.702
companies to the national markets will the President,3213.376,2.403
try to improve the access to the largest market in,3215.779,3.036
"the world, the European one by taking up TTIP",3218.815,2.736
negotiations or by any other means?,3221.551,1.835
"Mr. Spicer: Well, look, I don&amp;#39;t -- I think he&amp;#39;s",3223.386,2.203
going to increase market access wherever he can.,3225.589,2.268
He&amp;#39;s in the -- he&amp;#39;s in the process of reviewing all,3227.857,3.337
of our current trade agreements and looking at,3231.194,2.436
potential bilateral options going forward.,3233.63,2.936
"Whether it&amp;#39;s in the EU or in the Asia-Pacific arena,",3236.566,2.236
or in the Middle East he&amp;#39;s going to figure out where,3238.802,2.068
we can expand,3240.87,1.135
U.S. market access.,3242.005,1.201
"And that&amp;#39;s, I think, what today&amp;#39;s decision really",3243.206,3.67
starts to show is that it&amp;#39;s not about,3246.876,3.237
multilateral agreements,3250.113,1.568
under a Trump administration.,3251.681,1.068
It&amp;#39;s about bilateral agreements where we can,3252.749,2.236
figure out country to country how can we fight,3254.985,2.636
for the American worker; gain them access to,3257.621,2.402
another market that&amp;#39;s going to benefit our large,3260.023,1.868
and small businesses who want to sell additional,3261.891,2.036
goods and services. Yes?,3263.927,0.967
The Press: (inaudible) News.,3264.894,1.502
Why did the President choose the British Prime,3266.396,3.07
Minister as the first foreign leader,3269.466,2.269
for him to meet?,3271.735,1.601
And can we take from that that he intends to make,3273.336,3.404
the relationship even closer?,3276.74,1.635
Mr. Spicer: I think we&amp;#39;ve always had that special,3278.375,2.402
relationship with Britain and he&amp;#39;s going to -- and,3280.777,3.27
that reflects in his first visit -- in the Prime,3284.047,3.003
Minister&amp;#39;s first visit here.,3287.05,1.368
He&amp;#39;s had a great conversation with her and,3288.418,2.135
he looks forward to having her here.,3290.553,1.335
But we can always be closer.,3291.888,2.536
"Yes, ma&amp;#39;am?",3294.424,0.667
The Press: Jane with (inaudible) News.,3295.091,1.769
What kind of relationship is Trump looking for to,3296.86,2.936
build with China after he withdraws from TPP?,3299.796,2.636
"And on Taiwan&amp;#39;s issue, what kind of stance he is",3302.432,3.27
going to make on cross trade relations?,3305.702,2.302
Thank you.,3308.004,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: What&amp;#39;s the last part, please?",3308.672,1.568
"The Press: Taiwan, cross trade regulation.",3310.24,2.469
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think on China he understands",3312.709,3.537
what a big market that is for U.S.,3316.246,1.735
goods and services.,3317.981,0.767
When he met with the head of Alibaba a couple weeks,3318.748,2.736
ago that was part of the point.,3321.484,1.402
There&amp;#39;s a huge market issue there.,3322.886,1.868
But in a large -- in many cases it&amp;#39;s not,3324.754,2.069
a two-way street.,3326.823,1.368
There&amp;#39;s so many Chinese businesses and,3328.191,2.102
"individuals, frankly, who can have ease of access in",3330.293,3.137
the United States to sell their goods or services.,3333.43,2.769
And I think that whether or not you&amp;#39;re talking,3336.199,1.368
"about they financial services or the banking,",3337.567,2.436
"you know, the other service industries or our",3340.003,2.035
"manufacturing goods and service, or some of the",3342.038,2.469
"IP problems that we have in China, that it really is",3344.507,3.237
not a two-way street.,3347.744,1.101
And so he understands the market that China has and,3348.845,3.837
our desire to further penetrate that market.,3352.682,2.403
But also recognizes there&amp;#39;s a lot of concerns,3355.085,2.102
with how we are treated,3357.187,1.668
entering into China&amp;#39;s market.,3358.855,1.568
And we need to review that.,3360.423,1.502
"Yes, ma&amp;#39;am.",3361.925,0.667
I think we&amp;#39;re going to have further,3362.592,1.735
updates on that.,3364.327,0.667
"Yes, ma&amp;#39;am.",3364.994,0.668
The Press: Jessica Silva from CDTN. Welcome.,3365.662,1.701
Mr. Spicer: Thank you.,3367.363,1.202
The Press: Question follow on what she was,3368.565,2.435
asking about TPP.,3371,0.901
"You know, part of the thinking of TPP was to",3371.901,3.003
encircle China economically.,3374.904,0.935
And I wonder if the President has thought a,3375.839,2.702
little bit about what kind of bilateral relationships,3378.541,2.436
in the region -- the trade relationships would,3380.977,2.402
accomplish a similar goal.,3383.379,1.235
"And secondly, I think I heard you talking about",3384.614,2.703
"NAFTA and a trigger, but I didn&amp;#39;t hear you say you",3387.317,3.336
had triggered the trigger.,3390.653,1.202
Mr. Spicer: We have no triggered the trigger.,3391.855,2.435
(laughter),3394.29,0.668
It hasn&amp;#39;t happened.,3394.958,0.834
"But again, I think we have existing relationships",3395.792,2.102
with many of the countries that were part of the,3397.894,2.636
12-nation make up of TPP.,3400.53,2.97
And I think we&amp;#39;re going to continue to explore how we,3403.5,1.735
"can, in some cases, strengthen those",3405.235,1.434
relationships or look for bilateral agreements with,3406.669,2.436
nations that we didn&amp;#39;t have one through TPP.,3409.105,2.436
"Yes, sir? Yeah.",3411.541,1.134
"The Press: Sean, congratulations.",3412.675,1.469
Mr. Spicer: Thank you.,3414.144,1.501
The Press: My name is Bob Wiener; I&amp;#39;m a writer,3415.645,3.737
(inaudible) radio network.,3419.382,1.101
Social security and infrastructure.,3420.483,1.502
"On social security, the President will be meeting",3421.985,2.969
tonight with Congressional leaders.,3424.954,1.669
What&amp;#39;s he going to do given his campaign promise,3426.623,2.235
on not touching social security when Paul Ryan,3428.858,2.469
and Mitch McConnell send a bill that includes in a,3431.327,2.837
funding package various cuts in social security?,3434.164,2.836
"And on infrastructure, has it fallen off the radar",3437,2.235
screen or is it going to stay a priority for the,3439.235,2.736
President?,3441.971,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: Social security, he&amp;#39;s going to",3442.639,1.368
talk to them.,3444.007,0.667
I think he&amp;#39;s been very clear with his priorities,3444.674,1.702
in terms of preserving and protecting this really,3446.376,2.736
important benefit to our seniors.,3449.112,2.803
He understands.,3451.915,0.667
"I mean, the -- Mr. Trump&amp;#39;s employed so many people",3452.582,3.27
over the years he understands the struggle,3455.852,2.402
that people have later in life to continue,3458.254,2.069
to make ends meet.,3460.323,1.001
And I think that he is a -- keenly aware of how,3461.324,3.67
important this program is to so many people in,3464.994,2.436
their later years.,3467.43,0.801
And so he&amp;#39;s going to continue to fight to make,3468.231,2.769
sure that that&amp;#39;s a program that is preserved,3471,2.436
and protected.,3473.436,1.001
And then on the give me --,3474.437,2.736
The Press: Infrastructure.,3477.173,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: Infrastructure, of course.",3477.841,1.368
"Yes, that definitely -- I mean, he&amp;#39;s continued",3479.209,1.635
to bring that up.,3480.844,0.667
He talked with the business executives today,3481.511,2.002
about how so many of our airports that are so,3483.513,2.302
important to our commerce system -- getting planes,3485.815,2.403
"to land in and out, roads and their ability to truck",3488.218,2.669
"things across the country, even our freight system.",3490.887,2.803
That if our infrastructure is not strong it inhibits,3493.69,2.936
"our ability to have free commerce, it inhibits --",3496.626,2.569
it dries up the costs of goods and services when,3499.195,3.404
someone&amp;#39;s got to take a different route or is,3502.599,1.768
limited in the opportunities that they,3504.367,1.335
have because a runway might be closed or it,3505.702,2.235
can&amp;#39;t be expanded or a rail line breaks down.,3507.937,2.703
"Or, you know, a highway&amp;#39;s just not -- the wear and",3510.64,3.337
tear it puts on trucks or shutdowns.,3513.977,2.035
So infrastructure continues to be a huge,3516.012,1.602
priority for him.,3517.614,0.967
"Yes, sir?",3518.581,0.668
"The Press: Yeah, two questions.",3519.249,1.401
"The National Security Council, the staffing of",3520.65,2.669
the National Security Counsel -- when do you,3523.319,2.369
expect to have that -- those positions filled?,3525.688,2.336
Mr. Spicer: We&amp;#39;ve gotten many of them filled.,3528.024,1.602
The Press: Many of them are?,3529.626,1.034
"Mr. Spicer: I have to get back to you on the number,",3530.66,1.501
but it&amp;#39;s actually fairly robust right now.,3532.161,1.802
"There are a lot of holdovers, but General",3533.963,2.603
Flynn has been working diligently with Kate D,3536.566,2.436
"McFarland, his deputy, and others to make sure that",3539.002,2.602
"that&amp;#39;s filled out, ready to go.",3541.604,1.502
He&amp;#39;s had countless meetings with counterparts,3543.106,4.204
and had several folks detailed over.,3547.31,2.135
"But it&amp;#39;s a very, very robust efforts",3549.445,2.369
from day one.,3551.814,0.668
The Press: And a follow up to John Carl&amp;#39;s question.,3552.482,2.569
So are you retracting your claim on Saturday that it,3555.051,2.936
was the largest crowd in person,3557.987,1.201
for an inauguration?,3559.188,0.668
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s not what I said.,3559.856,1.334
"The Press: Well, you said that this was the largest",3561.19,2.002
"audience to ever witness an inauguration period,",3563.192,2.503
both in person and around the globe.,3565.695,2.302
Mr. Spicer: Right.,3567.997,0.734
The Press: To both in person it was the largest --,3568.731,2.603
Mr. Spicer: Witness and around the globe.,3571.334,1.668
"Yes, in total audience it was.",3573.002,1.435
"The Press: In total audience, but not",3574.437,1.668
simply in person.,3576.105,0.734
"Mr. Spicer: But that -- right, but again, I didn&amp;#39;t",3576.839,2.336
say in person.,3579.175,0.934
Both in person and around the globe to witness it.,3580.109,2.937
The Press: You&amp;#39;re saying those together?,3583.046,1.668
"Mr. Spicer: No, that&amp;#39;s actually what I said.",3584.714,3.37
It&amp;#39;s not what I -- I don&amp;#39;t know how you can interpret,3588.084,2.536
it differently.,3590.62,0.667
That&amp;#39;s literally what I said.,3591.287,1.969
To witness it in person and around the globe.,3593.256,2.969
Total audience yes.,3596.225,1.035
The Press: But not in person.,3597.26,1.702
"Mr. Spicer: Hold on, let him just --",3598.962,1.568
The Press: But not -- but you&amp;#39;re saying here -- just,3600.53,2.302
to clarify -- you&amp;#39;re not saying and you weren&amp;#39;t,3602.832,2.336
saying on Saturday that it was the largest inaugural,3605.168,1.968
crowd in person?,3607.136,0.734
Mr. Spicer: I am not.,3607.87,1.202
I&amp;#39;m saying that it was the total largest audience,3609.072,4.504
witnessed in person and around the globe.,3613.576,3.337
"Yes, sir?",3616.913,0.667
The Press: (inaudible) CBS News.,3617.58,1.335
Just go back to one other thing for a second.,3618.915,2.502
Mr. Spicer: Yes.,3621.417,0.801
The Press: Sources are telling CBS News -- those,3622.218,2.369
with knowledge of who was in the room and had,3624.587,2.636
lobbied the CIA -- that senior were not among,3627.223,2.402
those hooting and hollering and that there,3629.625,1.869
were some 40 people who were in the first front,3631.494,2.302
rows who were brought in by Trump and Pence and,3633.796,2.503
Pompeo.,3636.299,0.667
I&amp;#39;d like to give you a chance to respond to that,3636.966,2.336
recording.,3639.302,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s accurate at all.,3639.969,1.735
"In fact, I think if you listen to the audio of it",3641.704,1.902
you can hear the excitement,3643.606,2.236
that exists there.,3645.842,0.734
There was some people that had to be off camera for,3646.576,1.868
"obvious reasons, but I think when you looked at",3648.444,2.269
the number of people that were there the audio alone,3650.713,2.803
"tells, you know, speaks volumes to",3653.516,2.169
what had happened.,3655.685,1.435
I don&amp;#39;t -- I don&amp;#39;t think that there&amp;#39;s any,3657.12,1.534
question about that.,3658.654,0.801
The Press: So the people in the front who were seen,3659.455,2.136
"on camera, those were CIA employees?",3661.591,1.401
"Mr. Spicer: Honestly, I don&amp;#39;t have a",3662.992,1.935
seating chart.,3664.927,0.668
I think we had a very small footprint going,3665.595,2.269
over there.,3667.864,0.667
"I don&amp;#39;t know exactly who went over, but, I don&amp;#39;t",3668.531,3.003
know.,3671.534,0.667
Maybe 10 people at most?,3672.201,1.535
Sarah was there.,3673.736,1.602
"Ten where in the travel going over, so 10",3675.338,4.337
of 400-plus.,3679.675,1.902
The Press: But the people in the front rows -- those,3681.577,1.502
were CIA employees?,3683.079,0.734
The Press: Some probably were.,3683.813,1.568
Mr. Spicer: Some.,3685.381,0.968
The Press: Some?,3686.349,0.934
So some were not?,3687.283,1.301
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sure we seated -- I don&amp;#39;t -- I,3688.584,1.602
can&amp;#39;t say.,3690.186,0.667
I&amp;#39;m not really sure why this matters.,3690.853,1.802
"I mean, 10 people didn&amp;#39;t yell that loud.",3692.655,2.336
"The Press: Yes, but, you know, you just said that",3694.991,3.236
they were hooting and hollering.,3698.227,1.368
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, I did.",3699.595,1.068
The Press: And there&amp;#39;s not this rift between the,3700.663,1.969
intelligence community and the President.,3702.632,1.334
Because senior authorities within the intelligence,3703.966,1.435
community are telling CBS news that they&amp;#39;re,3705.401,1.802
uncomfortable with that portrayal.,3707.203,1.335
And the notion of people within the CIA (inaudible) --,3708.538,2.936
Mr. Spicer: All I can do is tell you to listen to,3711.474,2.002
the tape alone.,3713.476,0.801
I think you can,3714.277,0.901
hear a lot of that. Yes?,3715.178,1.368
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",3716.546,1.134
A couple questions if I could.,3717.68,1.368
I know you&amp;#39;ve been here for a while.,3719.048,1.802
Has the President formally requested or received,3720.85,1.602
Pentagon advice on how he could change the campaign,3722.452,2.035
against the Islamic State?,3724.487,0.901
Mr. Spicer: I think he has ordered it.,3725.388,2.769
He&amp;#39;s going to -- as I mentioned he&amp;#39;ll be at the,3728.157,1.635
Department of Defense on Friday to swear in General,3729.792,3.203
"Mattis as the next Secretary -- well, you",3732.995,2.47
"know, of -- go through the ceremony of that.",3735.465,2.636
He is obviously the Secretary of Defense.,3738.101,1.901
"And so, you know, at that time he will continue to",3740.002,4.605
have conversations about what he wants from them,3744.607,3.237
and the joint chiefs. Jim?,3747.844,1.067
The Press: Just a follow up.,3748.911,1.735
Mr. Spicer: Yes.,3750.646,0.868
The Press: I don&amp;#39;t -- I don&amp;#39;t mean to beat a dead,3751.514,1.702
horse on the issue of the U.S.,3753.216,2.502
"Embassy in Israel, but can you -- at the end of the",3755.718,2.87
"President&amp;#39;s first four years, assuming he&amp;#39;s -- at",3758.588,4.037
the end of the next four years -- will the United,3762.625,1.602
States Embassy be in Jerusalem?,3764.227,1.268
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think I&amp;#39;ve answered",3765.495,1.968
it twice now.,3767.463,1.635
We are at the early stages in this decision,3769.098,2.102
making process.,3771.2,0.834
"The Press: It&amp;#39;s not whether, it&amp;#39;s",3772.034,1.368
when and how.,3773.402,0.668
Mr. Spicer: I -- there&amp;#39;s a reason you go through a,3774.07,1.968
decision making process and that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re in,3776.038,2.369
the process of starting right now.,3778.407,1.402
So I just don&amp;#39;t want to get ahead of -- if it was,3779.809,2.502
already a decision then we wouldn&amp;#39;t be going,3782.311,1.869
through a process.,3784.18,0.867
I just answered the,3785.047,0.668
"-- thanks, Julie. Jim?",3785.715,0.667
"The Press: First of all, congratulations and thanks",3786.382,1.335
for taking the question.,3787.717,0.667
Getting back to Saturday at the CIA and your,3788.384,1.335
"statement here at the podium, why make this",3789.719,1.334
crowd side issue -- or crowd size issue something,3791.053,1.368
to talk about at all?,3792.421,0.668
"I mean, why get into it?",3793.089,0.667
Did it bother the President that much that,3793.756,5.005
he felt that you needed to come out here and,3808.604,2.57
straighten that out for us?,3811.174,1.901
And why did he choose the CIA as the venue to talk,3813.075,3.637
about that?,3816.712,1.268
"Mr. Spicer: So two things -- one, I just got",3817.98,2.169
handed a note.,3820.149,0.667
All of the people were not -- no one in the front row,3820.816,2.269
"was Trump, they were all CIA.",3823.085,1.402
The Press: Front row?,3824.487,0.701
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s what you asked.,3825.188,1.334
The Press: So the first three rows.,3826.522,1.335
Mr. Spicer: (laughs) I&amp;#39;l find out who the,3827.857,1.902
other two were.,3829.759,0.934
I&amp;#39;m sorry; I just got you the front row.,3830.693,1.635
Give me a second I&amp;#39;ll get the second and the third.,3832.328,2.002
Are we going to get to the fourth and the fifth?,3834.33,2.069
"Okay, so let me see what I can do.",3836.399,3.37
"Look, I think one of the things that happened, Jim,",3839.769,2.335
was that he kept hearing about this rift,3842.104,2.47
that existed.,3844.574,0.7
He talked about it a couple of weeks ago after,3845.274,3.037
his briefing -- how proud he is and how much he,3848.311,3.403
respects the intelligence community.,3851.714,1.335
And I think when he walked into that and he saw it he,3853.049,3.303
wanted to make sure that people knew that what,3856.352,1.435
you&amp;#39;re hearing on television or in reports,3857.787,2.469
about this rift -- I have,3860.256,1.969
the utmost respect for you.,3862.225,2.002
I honor your service.,3864.227,1.634
I&amp;#39;m proud of what you&amp;#39;re doing and the sacrifices,3865.861,2.002
that you&amp;#39;re making.,3867.863,1.202
And I think that he wanted them to know that you see,3869.065,2.002
and hear all this stuff on TV about this rift that,3871.067,3.236
so-called exists.,3874.303,1.502
And clearly it doesn&amp;#39;t matter.,3875.805,1.368
Like don&amp;#39;t believe what you&amp;#39;re hearing.,3877.173,1.768
Know that I have a tremendous amount of,3878.941,2.403
respect for you.,3881.344,1.067
I appreciate everything that you&amp;#39;re doing.,3882.411,1.869
And I think that&amp;#39;s why he wanted to do it.,3884.28,1.435
Is to make sure that they understand and they heard,3885.715,1.768
"first hand how much he respects them, how much he",3887.483,3.003
wanted to dispel the myth that there was a &amp;quot;rift.&amp;quot;,3890.486,2.336
"The Press: But in terms of the crowd size issue, why",3892.822,3.069
bring that up at the CIA and why did you come out,3895.891,2.77
Saturday afternoon to talk about that?,3898.661,1.335
"Did he tell you, &amp;quot;Sean, I&amp;#39;m upset about this?",3899.996,2.269
I want you to come out and set the record straight.&amp;quot;,3902.265,2.068
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to get into conversations,3904.333,1.702
"that I had with the President, but I will tell",3906.035,1.335
you that it&amp;#39;s not -- it&amp;#39;s not just about,3907.37,1.334
a crowd size.,3908.704,0.668
"It&amp;#39;s about this constant, you know, &amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s not",3909.372,2.435
going to run.&amp;quot;,3911.807,0.668
"Then, &amp;quot;If he runs he&amp;#39;s going to drop out.&amp;quot;",3912.475,1.368
"Then, &amp;quot;If he runs he can&amp;#39;t win.",3913.843,1.034
There&amp;#39;s no way he can win Pennsylvania.,3914.877,1.335
There&amp;#39;s no way he can win Michigan.&amp;quot;,3916.212,1.401
"Then, &amp;quot;If he won it&amp;#39;s, &amp;quot;Oh he didn&amp;#39;t --&amp;quot; There is",3917.613,1.869
this constant theme to undercut the enormous,3919.482,3.837
support that he has.,3923.319,1.568
And I think it&amp;#39;s just unbelievable frustrating,3924.887,2.636
"when you&amp;#39;re continually told, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not",3927.523,2.302
big enough.,3929.825,0.668
It&amp;#39;s not good enough.,3930.493,0.667
You can&amp;#39;t win.&amp;quot;,3931.16,0.767
The Press: And if I may --,3931.927,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: Hold on, because I think",3932.595,2.002
it&amp;#39;s important.,3934.597,1.068
He&amp;#39;s gone out there and defied the odds over and,3935.665,2.636
over and over again.,3938.301,1.634
And he keeps getting told what he can&amp;#39;t do by this,3939.935,2.97
"narrative that&amp;#39;s out there and he exceeds it every,",3942.905,2.302
single time.,3945.207,1.435
And I think there&amp;#39;s an overall frustration when,3946.642,2.403
you turn on the television over and over again and,3949.045,2.269
"get told that that there&amp;#39;s this narrative that,",3951.314,2.569
&amp;quot;You didn&amp;#39;t win.,3953.883,0.734
You weren&amp;#39;t going to run.,3954.617,0.967
You can&amp;#39;t pick up this state.,3955.584,1.335
"That&amp;#39;s not -- you know, that&amp;#39;s a fool&amp;#39;s errand to",3956.919,2.536
go to Pennsylvania.,3959.455,0.701
Why is he in Michigan?,3960.156,1.434
How silly.,3961.59,0.901
They&amp;#39;ll never vote for him.,3962.491,0.801
A republican hasn&amp;#39;t won that state since &amp;#39;88.&amp;quot;,3963.292,2.002
And then he goes and he does it and then what&amp;#39;s,3965.294,1.468
the next narrative?,3966.762,0.668
"&amp;quot;Well, it must have been because of this.",3967.43,1.635
He didn&amp;#39;t win that.&amp;quot;,3969.065,1.701
"And then, &amp;quot;Oh, people",3970.766,0.901
aren&amp;#39;t attending your thing.,3971.667,0.768
Or John Lewis is the first person to skip his,3972.435,2.802
inauguration.&amp;quot;,3975.237,0.668
Not true.,3975.905,0.967
And over and over again -- the MLK bust.,3976.872,2.269
I think over and over again there&amp;#39;s this,3979.141,1.902
constant attempt to undermine his credibility,3981.043,4.038
and the movement that he represents and it&amp;#39;s,3985.081,1.968
"frustrating for not just him, but I think so many",3987.049,2.703
of us that are trying to work to get,3989.752,2.302
this message out.,3992.054,0.668
And it -- and it -- and so I mentioned this to,3992.722,1.768
"Jonathan, but part of this is a two-way street.",3994.49,2.536
"Like, we want to -- we want to have a healthy",3997.026,3.37
"dialog, not just with you, but with the",4000.396,1.401
American people.,4001.797,1.302
Because he&amp;#39;s fighting for jobs.,4003.099,1.268
He&amp;#39;s fighting to make this country safer.,4004.367,1.901
"But when you&amp;#39;re constantly getting told,",4006.268,1.569
&amp;quot;That can&amp;#39;t be true.,4007.837,1.601
We doubt that you can do this.,4009.438,1.502
This won&amp;#39;t happen.&amp;quot;,4010.94,1.334
And that&amp;#39;s the narrative when you turn on,4012.274,1.669
television every single day.,4013.943,1.868
It&amp;#39;s a little frustrating.,4015.811,1.635
"And I think that for those people around him, his",4017.446,2.069
"senior team especially, but so many of the other",4019.515,2.202
folks that are either here in the administration that,4021.717,2.736
gave up their time during the transition -- they,4024.453,1.835
left a job to work for three or four weeks,4026.288,2.203
because they&amp;#39;re so committed to having his,4028.491,2.002
nominees get through -- it&amp;#39;s a little demoralizing,4030.493,2.836
"to turn on the TV day after day and hear,",4033.329,2.235
&amp;quot;Can&amp;#39;t do this.,4035.564,0.701
This guy&amp;#39;s not going to get confirmed.,4036.265,1.502
No way they&amp;#39;re going to go through.&amp;quot;,4037.767,1.334
The Press: But isn&amp;#39;t that just part of the,4039.101,1.869
conversation that happens in Washington?,4040.97,1.735
"Mr. Spicer: No, it&amp;#39;s not.",4042.705,1.134
The Press: And the scrutiny that comes with,4043.839,1.335
being President of the United States and living,4045.174,1.335
at the White House?,4046.509,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: No, look, I&amp;#39;ve been doing this",4047.176,1.368
a long time.,4048.544,0.667
You&amp;#39;ve been doing this too.,4049.211,0.734
"I&amp;#39;ve never seen it like this, Jim.",4049.945,1.936
"I&amp;#39;ve never -- and again, I&amp;#39;m not -- I&amp;#39;m not looking",4051.881,3.169
"to go back and forth, but you&amp;#39;re asking for",4055.05,2.036
an explanation.,4057.086,1.168
And I think that it&amp;#39;s important to understand,4058.254,2.335
"that whether it&amp;#39;s the President himself, the",4060.589,3.204
"Vice President, the senior team, the volunteers.",4063.793,3.637
"Or the people who are out there just, you know, in",4067.43,2.602
America that vote for him or walked the streets,4070.032,2.102
or put up a sign.,4072.134,1.468
"That to constantly told, &amp;quot;No, no, no.&amp;quot;",4073.602,3.037
"And to watch him go, &amp;quot;Yes, yes, yes,&amp;quot; every time and",4076.639,2.769
to come up to the next hurdle and see someone put,4079.408,1.635
a block up gets a little frustrating.,4081.043,2.269
"And I think that we are -- and so, you see this",4083.312,3.47
historic thing and he stands there at the,4086.782,1.535
"Capitol -- and I was not that close, but you know,",4088.317,2.736
on the platform and you look out and all you&amp;#39;re --,4091.053,2.836
it&amp;#39;s an amazing view.,4093.889,2.269
And it&amp;#39;s just so many people who got in long,4096.158,2.803
"lines, who had to go around all this",4098.961,1.935
stuff to get in.,4100.896,1.835
"And that was, for the first time, that we did",4102.731,1.502
have to go through fencing that far out -- and then,4104.233,5.038
"to hear, &amp;quot;Well, look at this shot.",4109.271,1.936
And it&amp;#39;s not that -- it wasn&amp;#39;t that big.&amp;quot;,4111.207,1.835
It&amp;#39;s a little demoralizing.,4113.042,1.201
Because when you&amp;#39;re sitting there and you&amp;#39;re,4114.243,1.335
looking out and you&amp;#39;re in awe of just how awesome,4115.578,2.936
that view is and how many people are there and you,4118.514,2.569
go back and you turn on the television and you see,4121.083,2.436
shots of comparing this and that.,4123.519,1.568
"I mean, you know, and then you look at the stuff",4125.087,2.803
"that&amp;#39;s happening, the nominees that get put out.",4127.89,2.235
The democrats stopping -- there are two cabinet,4130.125,3.003
"officials, ladies and gentlemen, that are taking",4133.128,2.103
their office today.,4135.231,1.001
He visited the CIA and a director that was,4136.232,2.535
considered a consensus candidate wasn&amp;#39;t approved.,4138.767,3.804
Where&amp;#39;s the story?,4142.571,1.702
"And I think that, so --",4144.273,1.034
The Press: Isn&amp;#39;t it a fair criticism that you&amp;#39;ve got,4145.307,2.036
bigger fish to fry?,4147.343,0.834
Like why worry about a couple of tweets about,4148.177,2.836
crowd sizes?,4151.013,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Because it&amp;#39;s not -- that&amp;#39;s,4151.68,1.335
what I&amp;#39;m saying.,4153.015,0.667
"You&amp;#39;re minimizing the point here, Jim.",4153.682,1.368
It&amp;#39;s not about one tweet.,4155.05,1.569
It&amp;#39;s not about one picture.,4156.619,2.602
It&amp;#39;s about a constant theme.,4159.221,2.403
"It&amp;#39;s about sitting here every time and being told,",4161.624,3.336
"&amp;quot;No, well we don&amp;#39;t think he can do that.",4164.96,2.036
He&amp;#39;ll never accomplish that.,4166.996,1.635
He can&amp;#39;t win that.,4168.631,1.067
It won&amp;#39;t be the biggest; it&amp;#39;s not going,4169.698,1.535
to be that good.,4171.233,0.901
The crowds aren&amp;#39;t that big.,4172.134,1.435
He&amp;#39;s not that successful.&amp;quot;,4173.569,1.301
The narrative and the -- the default narrative is,4174.87,3.07
always negative.,4177.94,1.668
And it&amp;#39;s demoralizing.,4179.608,1.468
And I think when you sit here and you realize the,4181.076,2.002
"sacrifice the guy made of leaving a very, very",4183.078,3.07
successful business because he really cares,4186.148,2.536
about this country and he wants to -- despite your,4188.684,2.769
partisan differences he cares about making this,4191.453,2.77
country better for everybody.,4194.223,1.768
He wants to make it safer for everybody.,4195.991,1.769
And so when you wake up every say and that&amp;#39;s what,4197.76,2.335
you&amp;#39;re seeing over and over again and you&amp;#39;re not,4200.095,1.969
seeing stories about the cabinet folks that he&amp;#39;s,4202.064,3.337
putting in or the success that he&amp;#39;s having trying to,4205.401,1.868
keep American jobs here?,4207.269,1.168
"Yeah, it is a little disappointing.",4208.437,2.436
"So, I just -- it&amp;#39;s, you know --",4210.873,3.003
The Press: It&amp;#39;s not always going to be positive.,4213.876,3.336
Sometimes negative stories --,4217.212,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: No, it&amp;#39;s not.",4217.88,0.667
"And sometimes we&amp;#39;ll make mistakes,",4218.547,1.335
I promise you that.,4219.882,0.667
"But it&amp;#39;s not always got to be negative, Jim.",4220.549,1.335
Some days we do do the right thing.,4221.884,1.334
Some days we are -- we are successful.,4223.218,3.304
So it&amp;#39;s not -- part of this is saying when we&amp;#39;re,4226.522,3.17
"right, say we&amp;#39;re right.",4229.692,1.735
"When we&amp;#39;re wrong, say we&amp;#39;re wrong.",4231.427,2.335
But it&amp;#39;s not always wrong and negative.,4233.762,3.103
There are things -- there&amp;#39;s a lot of things,4236.865,1.569
that he&amp;#39;s done already.,4238.434,1.301
"A lot of amazing people he&amp;#39;s appointed, a lot of",4239.735,2.069
success that he&amp;#39;s having.,4241.804,1.535
And it would be once -- nice once in a while for,4243.339,2.235
someone just to say -- report it straight up.,4245.574,2.703
"He appointed this person, here&amp;#39;s their background",4248.277,2.803
not why they&amp;#39;re not going to get nominated.,4251.08,2.435
Not why it&amp;#39;s not going to happen.,4253.515,1.535
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",4255.05,1.669
Mr. Spicer: Hold on.,4256.719,1.701
"One last thing, hold on.",4258.42,2.102
"I can&amp;#39;t -- I know we&amp;#39;re getting really into,",4260.522,1.936
"like, facts.",4262.458,0.667
"So just to be clear, there were no Trump or",4263.125,3.003
Whitehouse folks sitting down.,4266.128,2.002
They were all in the CIA (inaudible).,4268.13,1.902
So not in rows one through anything from,4270.032,3.003
what I&amp;#39;m told.,4273.035,0.667
"I appreciate Julie&amp;#39;s effort, but I want --",4273.702,2.503
"Hallie, John, you got one.",4276.205,0.967
Give me a second.,4277.172,1.168
"The Press: So Sean, a couple -- a couple of",4278.34,1.335
questions for you if you don&amp;#39;t mind.,4279.675,1.335
Mr. Spicer: Yeah.,4281.01,0.8
The Press: First one on Russia.,4281.81,2.036
The administration was asked about multiple,4283.846,1.935
interactions between National Security Advisor,4285.781,1.435
Mike Flynn and a Russian ambassador.,4287.216,1.701
"I believe you, at the time, the administration",4288.917,2.303
at the time said the calls were related to setting up,4291.22,3.136
a discussion later between President Trump and,4294.356,2.002
Vladimir Putin.,4296.358,0.668
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s right.,4297.026,1.034
The Press: Were those conversations about,4298.06,1.735
anything else other than setting,4299.795,1.435
up that discussion?,4301.23,0.834
And why has that discussion not yet,4302.064,2.002
happened between the,4304.066,0.867
President and President Putin?,4304.933,1.135
"Mr. Spicer: So, there&amp;#39;s been one call.",4306.068,2.235
I talked to General Flynn about this,4308.303,2.169
again last night.,4310.472,1.535
One call talked about four subjects.,4312.007,2.77
One was the loss of life that occurred in the plane,4314.777,4.237
"crash that took their military choir, two was",4319.014,3.037
"Christmas and holiday greetings, three was to",4322.051,2.602
facilitate -- or to talk about a conference in,4324.653,2.369
"Syria on ISIS, and four was to set up a -- to talk",4327.022,3.504
about after the inauguration setting up a,4330.526,2.569
call between President Putin and President Trump.,4333.095,2.769
That -- I don&amp;#39;t believe that that has been set up,4335.864,3.337
yet because the call was to say after -- sorry.,4339.201,2.636
They did follow up two days ago about how to,4341.837,3.036
facilitate that call once again.,4344.873,2.002
So there have been a total of two calls with the,4346.875,3.17
Ambassador and General Flynn and the second call,4350.045,2.97
"came, I think it&amp;#39;s now three days ago, that was",4353.015,2.302
to say once he gets into office can we,4355.317,2.369
set up that call?,4357.686,1.368
It hasn&amp;#39;t -- to my knowledge --,4359.054,1.235
hasn&amp;#39;t occurred yet.,4360.289,1.368
The Press: Any other conversations between,4361.657,1.368
General Flynn and the Russian members,4363.025,1.334
of the government?,4364.359,0.668
Mr. Spicer: Not that I&amp;#39;m aware of.,4365.027,1.334
"And when I say that, what I&amp;#39;m saying is during the",4366.361,1.335
transition I asked General Flynn that -- whether or,4367.696,2.202
not there were any conversations beyond the,4369.898,1.969
"Ambassador and he said, &amp;quot;No.&amp;quot;",4371.867,1.568
The Press: And then one more follow up on Julie&amp;#39;s,4373.435,1.335
question from earlier on a statement that the,4374.77,1.501
President made on Saturday.,4376.271,1.035
Can you -- and I just want to clarify,4377.306,2.069
your answer here.,4379.375,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Yeah.,4380.042,0.701
The Press: Can you unequivocally state that,4380.743,1.601
this administration will not send more troops into,4382.344,1.835
"Iraq to, as the President has put it,",4384.179,1.835
&amp;quot;Take the oil.&amp;quot;,4386.014,0.668
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to talk about what we may,4386.682,2.102
or may not do.,4388.784,0.701
I think the President&amp;#39;s been very clear that he,4389.485,1.801
doesn&amp;#39;t telegraph forward what -- taking options,4391.286,2.536
off the table.,4393.822,0.668
That&amp;#39;s not a good negotiating skill.,4394.49,1.701
That&amp;#39;s not how he works.,4396.191,1.135
There&amp;#39;s a reason he&amp;#39;s been successful at negotiating.,4397.326,2.068
It&amp;#39;s because he does it in a way that doesn&amp;#39;t,4399.394,1.902
telegraph to people what he&amp;#39;s going to take on,4401.296,1.769
or off the table.,4403.065,1.334
Jeff Mason?,4404.399,0.668
The Press: Where is the President&amp;#39;s thinking now,4405.067,2.703
on the Supreme Court?,4407.77,1.401
Is he closer to naming some nominees?,4409.171,2.469
And in a follow up to -- a nominee -- narrowing down,4411.64,4.204
his nominees I should have said.,4415.844,2.236
And at the end of the Obama administration the,4418.08,2.369
number of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay was,4420.449,1.802
reduced to about 40.,4422.251,1.001
What are the President&amp;#39;s plans for that prison?,4423.252,2.002
Mr. Spicer: Right.,4425.254,0.8
"So, on the first, I think that in the next week or",4426.054,3.104
so we should have an update on a nominee for,4429.158,2.836
the Supreme Court.,4431.994,0.7
The Press: (inaudible) nomination or?,4432.694,1.936
Mr. Spicer: It does.,4434.63,1.601
I think we will have a nomination within the,4436.231,2.069
next couple weeks.,4438.3,1.301
He continues to make that a priority of his.,4439.601,1.735
"On GTMO, I think you&amp;#39;re",4441.336,3.137
going to see further action.,4444.473,1.268
"I don&amp;#39;t want to get ahead of the President, but this",4445.741,1.535
is something that has been discussed and it is in his,4447.276,3.47
current decision making process how he wants,4450.746,2.469
to handle that. Yeah?,4453.215,0.667
"The Press: This is a follow up to the CIA, if I",4453.882,2.303
could just ask one more (inaudible).,4456.185,1.368
That the President disagreed with the,4457.553,1.468
characteristic of a rift,4459.021,1.001
with the intelligence community.,4460.022,1.334
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s right.,4461.356,0.901
"The Press: Do you dispute, though, his Tweet about",4462.257,2.002
comparing the intelligence community to Nazi Germany?,4464.259,1.769
"Mr. Spicer: I -- no, I think how -- what he was",4466.028,2.335
talking about was the process not the people.,4468.363,2.369
And that&amp;#39;s a very,4470.732,0.668
different thing. Shane?,4471.4,0.901
Mr. Spicer: I want to ask -- three months ago then,4472.301,2.135
candidate Trump was in Gettysburg and he made a,4474.436,1.935
whole list of day one promises.,4476.371,2.703
He called it the Contract of the American Voters.,4479.074,2.136
A bunch of them are not going to get done today,4481.21,3.236
because you said he&amp;#39;s done with,4484.446,1.769
making executive orders.,4486.215,0.867
"Labor in China a currency manipulator, imposing",4487.082,2.069
"Congressional term limits, imposing that -- I wanted",4489.151,2.335
to ask you why not pursue all those on day one as he,4491.486,2.937
promised in a contract with the voters?,4494.423,1.368
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think he is -- we&amp;#39;re going to",4495.791,2.002
continue to sequence those out.,4497.793,1.802
I think part of it is to make sure that we don&amp;#39;t,4499.595,2.168
spend our entire day signing executive orders,4501.763,2.303
and bringing you in.,4504.066,1.067
There is a way that we can do this to make sure that,4505.133,2.103
we&amp;#39;re getting all of those things that he promised,4507.236,2.302
the American people done in short haste and doing,4509.538,3.136
it in a way that doesn&amp;#39;t just jam a knot,4512.674,2.036
in a fire hose.,4514.71,0.667
And I think part of this is ensuring that,4515.377,2.336
we sequence these.,4517.713,1.168
It gives the American people the proper -- the,4518.881,2.535
issue the proper attention that they deserve.,4521.416,3.003
Because part of it is that when -- if we put them all,4524.419,1.969
out on one day they lose president-- they get lost,4526.388,3.17
"in the ether, I think.",4529.558,0.767
And I think he made these promises and,4530.325,2.403
pledges to the American,4532.728,0.934
people because they&amp;#39;re important to him. So --,4533.662,2.035
The Press: He still plans to do everything on that,4535.697,2.736
day one list though?,4538.433,0.734
"Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s his intention, yeah.",4539.167,1.502
He&amp;#39;s very clear about that.,4540.669,0.934
"Yes, sir?",4541.603,0.668
The Press: Is the President going to shake,4542.271,1.334
up the leadership of CFPD before the director&amp;#39;s,4543.605,2.269
term is up?,4545.874,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to -- no decision has been,4546.541,2.136
made at this time on that.,4548.677,0.968
Kristen Walker?,4549.645,0.667
"The Press: Thank you very much, Sean.",4550.312,1.802
One on Obamacare -- has he finished his plan,4552.114,2.435
on Obamacare?,4554.549,0.668
When will the American people see that?,4555.217,1.802
"And then on NAFTA, can you just clarify; I know he&amp;#39;s",4557.019,2.969
going to meet with the leaders of,4559.988,1.902
Mexico and Canada.,4561.89,0.834
Has he started to have discussions with them,4562.724,2.169
currently about renegotiating that?,4564.893,1.335
He indicated on Sunday --,4566.228,1.101
Mr. Spicer: Yeah.,4567.329,1.001
"On Obamacare, I think he&amp;#39;s going to continue the",4568.33,2.135
discussion tonight with speaker Ryan in particular,4570.465,2.97
at the meeting that he&amp;#39;s going to have,4573.435,3.403
after the reception.,4576.838,1.268
"When it comes to the -- I&amp;#39;m sorry, the",4578.106,2.703
other part was?,4580.809,0.667
The Press: NAFTA.,4581.476,0.701
Mr. Spicer: NAFTA.,4582.177,0.901
There&amp;#39;s -- he discussed on the phone with both,4583.078,4.738
leaders his desire to reform it.,4587.816,2.402
But obviously his goal was to have that discussion,4590.218,3.437
when they come in person and I think I mentioned,4593.655,1.502
"yesterday, the foreign minister of Mexico is",4595.157,1.868
"going to come on the 25th, 26th, to sort of set the",4597.025,3.27
table and have some of those meetings ahead of,4600.295,3.303
President Pena Nieto&amp;#39;s meeting here.,4603.598,1.669
The Press: (inaudible) now that he&amp;#39;s officially,4605.267,2.703
in office?,4607.97,0.767
Don&amp;#39;t they deserve to see that?,4608.737,2.336
"Mr. Spicer: Well, again, he&amp;#39;s been -- this is his",4611.073,3.87
first working day.,4614.943,1.268
"I think it&amp;#39;s been pretty busy and robust, not just",4616.211,1.969
"today, but in the two and a half other days",4618.18,2.302
that we had.,4620.482,0.667
And I think you&amp;#39;re going to see a lot,4621.149,2.67
more come out.,4623.819,1.368
"But, you know, there&amp;#39;s a lot of things that have to",4625.187,2.068
get done and a lot of things that we&amp;#39;re working,4627.255,2.103
on as a staff to get him prepared.,4629.358,1.334
"He&amp;#39;s going to continue to have very,",4630.692,1.335
very robust weeks.,4632.027,1.234
Thank you guys.,4633.261,0.801
I appreciate it.,4634.062,0.901
This was a good first one.,4634.963,1.101
"The Press: One more question, Sean?",4636.064,2.436
"One more, please?",4638.5,1.201
Mr. Spicer: Go ahead.,4639.701,1.635
"The Press: Thank you, sir.",4641.336,2.002
"Mr. Spicer: Well, he&amp;#39;s --",4643.338,2.036
"The Press: First of all, congratulations.",4645.374,2.435
(inaudible) coming from the business community.,4647.809,2.436
My question -- last Tuesday I have gone to a,4650.245,4.037
number of nation (inaudible) including the,4654.282,2.436
national American and Indian American,4656.718,2.036
(inaudible).,4658.754,0.667
And most of those people were supporting Trump,4659.421,2.97
supporting the actions and also trade.,4662.391,2.435
But the most important (inaudible) from U.S.,4664.826,2.836
"India Business Council, (inaudible).",4667.662,1.635
He present for 500 fortune companies to,4669.297,2.837
and from India.,4672.134,1.201
The Press: Question.,4673.335,1.234
The Press: And he said -- his company,4674.569,3.237
starts supporting.,4677.806,0.801
So my question is where do we go after U.S.-India and,4678.607,4.471
U.S-Asia -- U.S.-India business relations,4683.078,2.035
are concerned?,4685.113,0.801
"Mr. Spicer: Look, thank you for the question.",4685.914,3.237
(laughter),4689.151,0.934
I think that whether it&amp;#39;s India or other countries,4690.085,3.136
"throughout the globe today, as I mentioned, the",4693.221,1.869
goal is to figure out countries and markets that,4695.09,2.903
we want to access that benefit the American,4697.993,1.835
"worker, help us grow manufacturing, the",4699.828,1.935
services industry.,4701.763,1.302
And so that&amp;#39;s one area that we&amp;#39;ll continue to,4703.065,1.735
work with the Prime Minister there on.,4704.8,1.468
But we&amp;#39;ve got a very robust agenda.,4706.268,1.668
Thank you guys; it&amp;#39;s been a pleasure.,4707.936,1.902
God Bless.,4709.838,0.667
See you tomorrow.,4710.505,0.968
