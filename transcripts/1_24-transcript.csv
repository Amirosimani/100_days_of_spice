Mr. Spicer: Okay. Good.,11.077,0.801
"As you know, we&amp;#39;ve had a tremendous amount of",11.878,1.835
activity here in the last 24 hours.,13.713,1.502
Really focused on the American worker.,15.215,2.169
Buy America and hire America is at the core of,17.384,2.869
the president&amp;#39;s plan to create an economy that,20.253,2.202
works for everyone.,22.455,1.335
"And I think, by every indication, you&amp;#39;ve seen",23.79,1.602
that focus in the past 24 and 36 hours.,25.392,3.603
Before we begin going through the events of,28.995,2.236
"today, I want to start off with a quick rundown of",31.231,2.969
all that the president and his administration have,34.2,1.669
done with just one official working,35.869,2.035
day under our belts.,37.904,1.401
"I don&amp;#39;t know about everyone else, but I think",39.305,1.902
it&amp;#39;s been a pretty impressive first and,41.207,2.236
second full days here.,43.443,2.102
President Trump&amp;#39;s meetings yesterday with top,45.545,1.802
business and union leaders -- including front-line,47.347,2.702
"union workers -- went very well, and I think it was a",50.049,2.403
signal to every American worker that jobs and the,52.452,2.436
economy are truly the president&amp;#39;s top priority.,54.888,3.77
"A few of the participants noted afterwards, in each",58.658,2.069
"one of these groups that we meet with, that this",60.727,2.102
"was the first time -- in some cases, ever -- that",62.829,2.002
they&amp;#39;ve been reached out to -- in almost every,64.831,2.002
"case, the first time they were invited",66.833,1.335
into the Oval Office.,68.168,1.468
And I really think that when you look at the level,69.636,4.237
of concern and interest that he has in the,73.873,1.969
"American worker, it&amp;#39;s been clearly on display in the",75.842,2.97
last 24 -- 36 hours.,78.812,2.268
"In addition to these productive meetings, the",81.08,1.602
president also took major steps towards fulfilling,82.682,2.603
some of his biggest campaign promises to,85.285,2.102
the American people.,87.387,1.368
He ushered in a new era of U.S.,88.755,1.501
trade policy by withdrawing from the,90.256,2.069
Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement and restored,92.325,2.836
respect for taxpayers by instituting a hiring,95.161,2.836
freeze on the executive branch.,97.997,1.769
He also re-affirmed his commitment to life by,99.766,3.07
re-establishing the Mexico City policy.,102.836,2.502
And the president ended his day yesterday with a,105.338,2.035
"bipartisan, bicameral meeting of Congressional",107.373,2.103
"leaders, where he made it clear that he expects",109.476,3.103
there to be no delay in getting an agenda through,112.579,2.769
-- his agenda through Congress and action,115.348,2.035
out of Washington.,117.383,1.502
"This morning, the president began his day",118.885,1.969
"with a breakfast, listening to key",120.854,1.935
automobile executives.,122.789,1.702
They spoke about the importance of increasing,124.491,1.768
manufacturing capabilities,126.259,2.169
specific to the automotive industry.,128.428,2.836
They touched on the need for regulatory reform and,131.264,2.369
"modernized safety standards, which will",133.633,2.269
"advance the industry, leading to technology and",135.902,2.936
job creation here in the United States.,138.838,1.835
"I think you&amp;#39;ve been briefed on the attendees,",140.673,1.602
but real quickly -- Mary Barra was the -- is the,142.275,2.402
head of General Motors -- was here.,144.677,1.635

"Chrysler, Zio Jakki, the head of government",160.126,3.504

Kushner was on-hand.,167.5,1.168
"Reince Priebus, Steve Bannon, Stephen Miller,",168.668,2.603
"Gary Cohn, and Hope Hicks.",171.271,2.035
Then the president signed a series of executive,173.306,2.369
actions that will move our country towards energy,175.675,2.536
"independence, but more importantly, really",178.211,2.035
continue to get Americans back to work.,180.246,2.603
The president started by signing a memorandum to --,182.849,2.903
fulfilling a major promise to secure swift approval,185.752,2.569
for the Keystone Pipeline.,188.321,1.702
The memorandum invites Trans-Canada to resubmit,190.023,2.435
their proposal and directs agencies to approve,192.458,2.803
it without delay.,195.261,1.835
There&amp;#39;s an energy revolution that&amp;#39;s going to,197.096,1.635
"happen in this country, and in spite of the",198.731,2.636
bureaucratic and political barriers that have been in,201.367,1.835
"place in the past, we&amp;#39;re ready to move forward.",203.202,3.27
Oil and gas production is up significantly in the,206.472,2.036
"last decade, and our imports have been",208.508,2.069
cut in half.,210.577,1.401
The president&amp;#39;s actions today will create tens of,211.978,2.369
"thousands of new jobs for the American workers, and",214.347,3.203
"move us greater towards energy independence, while",217.55,2.903
at the same time ensuring that we keep the,220.453,1.969
environment as a top priority.,222.422,2.702
The president also signed a memorandum regarding the,225.124,2.236
Dakota Access Pipeline.,227.36,1.768
This memorandum directs agencies to expedite,229.128,2.236
reviews and approvals for the remaining portions of,231.364,2.669
"this pipeline, which the previous administration",234.033,2.903
held up for political reasons.,236.936,1.468
"The $3.8 billion pipeline, already 90 percent",238.404,3.671
"complete, will carry over 500,000 barrels a day of",242.075,4.304
crude oil from areas in North Dakota to oil,246.379,2.703
markets in the U.S.,249.082,0.967
"And in both of these areas, as the president",250.049,2.036
"remarked this morning, he&amp;#39;s going to ensure that",252.085,2.202
we continue to negotiate in both areas to provide,254.287,2.736
the best deal for the American taxpayer.,257.023,2.97
The president signed an executive order,259.993,1.635
establishing a framework for expediting,261.628,2.068
environmental review for high-priority,263.696,2.036
infrastructure projects.,265.732,1.635
Delays and other inefficiencies in the,267.367,2.035
environmental review and permitting process are,269.402,2.369
severely impeding critically important,271.771,2.603
projects that will help us re-modernize and rebuild,274.374,3.47
our nation&amp;#39;s infrastructure.,277.844,1.735
This order will help put an end to the crippling,279.579,1.902
delays caused by bureaucratic red tape.,281.481,3.303
The president also signed a memorandum requiring the,284.784,2.402
Commerce Secretary to submit a report,287.186,2.77
recommending how best to,289.956,1.301
streamline manufacturing permitting.,291.257,2.97
The president has been hearing from manufacturing,294.227,2.369
"-- manufacturers, rather -- that excessive",296.596,1.868
regulation are driving them out of the U.S.,298.464,3.103
As part of his commitment to making America work,301.567,1.969
"again, the president has directed the Commerce",303.536,2.402
Secretary to reach out to manufacturers and the,305.938,1.902
public to identify regulations that are,307.84,2.436
hurting them from moving forward.,310.276,1.935
The president also signed a memorandum directing the,312.211,1.902
Commerce Secretary to lead a study looking into,314.113,2.403
building the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines as,316.516,3.503
well as any other future pipeline with U.S.-made,320.019,4.004
"steel, and pipe, and accessories.",324.023,2.803
This is the first step in the president really,326.826,1.768
delivering on his campaign promise to put American,328.594,2.069
steel back at the backbone of the U.S. economy.,330.663,2.569
The U.S. has lost nearly one-third of its manufacturing,333.232,3.27
"base since 1997, even though the country&amp;#39;s population",336.502,3.938
has increased by 50 million people.,340.44,2.369
We&amp;#39;re going to rebuild our infrastructure and we&amp;#39;re,342.809,1.668
going to do it with American workers and with,344.477,2.069
American resources.,346.546,1.868
"As many of you recall, the &amp;quot;buy American&amp;quot; theme was a",348.414,3.437
major part of the president&amp;#39;s,351.851,1.235
inaugural address.,353.086,1.434
This is clearly an immediate action and,354.52,2.036
extension of that promise that he made to the,356.556,1.935
American people last Friday.,358.491,2.402
"We sorely need these infrastructure jobs,",360.893,1.869
according to the National Association,362.762,1.335
of Manufacturers.,364.097,1.267
Without improvements to our transportation,365.364,1.969
"systems, quote, &amp;quot;The United States will lose",367.333,1.902
more than 2.5 million jobs by 2025.&amp;quot; Creating jobs,369.235,5.873
"and boosting wages is the president&amp;#39;s top priority,",375.108,3.036
and it has been made very clear over the past 36,378.144,2.736
hours that he&amp;#39;s -- this is an area where he&amp;#39;s taking,380.88,2.302
immediate action.,383.182,1.502
"At 1:00, the president will speak -- was speaking",384.684,3.203
with Indian Prime Minister Modi.,387.887,1.335
We&amp;#39;ll have a read-out as soon as that&amp;#39;s available.,389.222,1.334
"If we can get it to you during the briefing,",390.556,1.335
we will.,391.891,0.667
"This afternoon, the president will hold a",392.558,1.335
"bipartisan meeting with key Senate leadership,",393.893,1.368
"including the Majority Leader, the Minority",395.261,1.335
"Leader, the Majority Whip, and the Minority Whip, to",396.596,5.005
discuss his nomination for Justice -- Associate,403.97,2.602
Justice of the United States Supreme Court.,406.572,2.203
"As he noted earlier today, he intends to have a",408.775,2.135
decision by the end of the week and an announcement,410.91,2.502
early next week.,413.412,1.335
The president has made it incredibly clear that he,414.747,2.002
will appoint justices who protect our liberty and,416.749,2.569
hold the highest regards for the Constitution.,419.318,2.803
He continues to carefully consider potential future,422.121,2.369
justices based on their commitment to upholding,424.49,3.07
these principles.,427.56,1.268
This meeting is an important opportunity for,428.828,1.768
the president to consult with Senate leaders from,430.596,2.203
both sides of the aisle on his potential choices for,432.799,2.502
the bench.,435.301,1.168
"As you may have heard, Speaker Ryan extended an",436.469,1.968
invitation to the president to address a,438.437,2.37
joint session of Congress on February 28th.,440.807,2.068
I&amp;#39;m pleased to inform you that the president has,442.875,2.569
"accepted that invitation, and he looks forward to",445.444,2.57
sharing his plans for,448.014,0.867
moving the country forward.,448.881,1.602
"I have a feeling, by the time we get to February",450.483,2.035
"28th, we will have a lot to talk about.",452.518,2.836
"It was great to see the nominations of Dr. Carson,",455.354,2.269
"Secretary Chao, Mr. Ross, and Governor Haley were",457.623,2.937
advanced out of committee today.,460.56,1.768
"Just as a reminder, by the end of the first week of",462.328,2.769
"President Obama&amp;#39;s first week in office, he had 12.",465.097,2.336
"So, the Senate&amp;#39;s got a little catching up to do,",467.433,2.035
and I hope the Senate Democrats do their job and,469.468,3.938
help us catch up that number.,473.406,1.802
One quick follow-up on our storm relief efforts that,475.208,3.003
have plagued the Southeast.,478.211,1.534
White House staff is in touch with officials in,479.745,2.269
the states and will continue to provide,482.014,1.468
assistance to the recovery.,483.482,1.736
"A FEMA team is on the ground in Atlanta, Georgia",485.218,2.268
to support response and recovery activities.,487.486,2.47
FEMA liaison officers have been deployed to emergency,489.956,2.869
support centers in both Mississippi and Georgia,492.825,2.87
for reponse activities.,495.695,2.536
"With that, I&amp;#39;ll be glad to take a few questions.",498.231,2.002
The Press: Sure.,500.233,1.267
"Mr. Spicer: Jim Stimson, Lifezette.",501.5,2.403
"The Press: Today, immigration enforcement",503.903,2.369
organizations and activists expressed,506.272,1.935
concern that they haven&amp;#39;t seen immediate action on,508.207,3.804
DACA and DAPA.,512.011,1.435
And I was just wondering -- that was a key campaign,513.446,5.272
plan of President Trump on the campaign trail.,518.718,3.837
When can people expect action on that?,522.555,3.337
It wouldn&amp;#39;t require -- it would only require,525.892,3.837
stopping renewing the applications.,529.729,1.902
It wouldn&amp;#39;t actually,531.631,1.434
be retroactive against anyone.,533.065,1.902
"So, what&amp;#39;s the hold-up?",534.967,1.936
"Mr. Spicer: Well, as I think I mentioned",536.903,2.268
"yesterday, I think when it comes to immigration and",539.171,2.47
the promises that the president made during the,541.641,2.569
campaign to both ensure that we build a wall and,544.21,3.437
"enforce our southern border, as well as reform",547.647,2.335
"our entire immigration system, his priority is",549.982,1.902
first and foremost focused on people who pose a,551.884,2.736
threat to people in our country -- to,554.62,1.435
"criminals, frankly.",556.055,1.301
And that&amp;#39;s where he wants ICE to,557.356,1.435
focus their efforts.,558.791,1.301
"With respect to DACA, I think he&amp;#39;s considering to",560.092,2.102
make sure that his Cabinet-level team starts,562.194,2.57
to organize and create a plan to move forward with,564.764,2.435
respect to that issue.,567.199,0.735
And that&amp;#39;s where we are right now.,567.934,2.002
David Jackson.,569.936,0.667
"The Press: Sean, there are stories out there that the",570.603,3.47
EPA officials have been gagged from talking to the,574.073,2.002
"press, talking to the media.",576.075,1.468
"The -- basically, there&amp;#39;s a gag order, the same kind",577.543,2.169
of thing we had from the Interior Department,579.712,1.768
over the weekend.,581.48,0.701
"First of all, is that true?",582.181,0.801
"And secondly, why is that being done if it is?",582.982,1.668
"Mr. Spicer: Well, yeah, I don&amp;#39;t know.",584.65,1.335
That story literally is breaking as we were,585.985,1.368
entering the briefing room.,587.353,1.268
We&amp;#39;re looking into it.,588.621,1.034
I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s any surprise that when there&amp;#39;s,589.655,2.703
"an administration turnover, that we&amp;#39;re going",592.358,2.235
to review the policies.,594.593,1.001
"But with respect to the question you&amp;#39;re asking, I",595.594,2.57
don&amp;#39;t have any information at this time.,598.164,1.701
We asked the team to go look into it as we were,599.865,2.069
entering the briefing room.,601.934,0.768
"And if I have an update while we&amp;#39;re here, I&amp;#39;ll be",602.702,2.168
glad to get back to you.,604.87,1.735
The Press: And what about the Interior Department?,606.605,3.27
Did they have the same kind of thing,609.875,1.335
over the weekend?,611.21,0.701
Supposedly they were banned from Tweet,611.911,1.334
-- Twitter?,613.245,0.668
Mr. Spicer: I read that.,613.913,0.667
My understanding is is that because they had,614.58,1.335
inappropriately violated their own social media,615.915,1.334
"policies, there was guidance that was put out",617.249,1.335
to the Department to act in compliance with the,618.584,1.735
rules that were set forth.,620.319,0.901
The Press: [inaudible].,621.22,1.101
Mr. Spicer: All right.,622.321,1.435
Steve Holland.,623.756,0.734
"The Press: Oh, well, in signing the orders on",624.49,2.803
"Keystone and Dakota Access this morning, he said he",627.293,2.602
would like to renegotiate some of the terms.,629.895,2.336
What exactly was he talking about there?,632.231,1.735
"Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s a great question, Steve.",633.966,1.735
I think one of the things that the American people,635.701,2.303
clearly know about Donald Trump is he is a,638.004,2.268
successful businessman and a successful negotiator.,640.272,2.87
"And as he looks at these deals, what he&amp;#39;s trying to",643.142,2.97
ensure is that these projects -- that are great,646.112,3.703
in the sense they&amp;#39;re going to create jobs and help,649.815,2.203
"our economy -- but in a lot of cases, they&amp;#39;re",652.018,1.601
going to make these organizations,653.619,1.702
a lot of money.,655.321,0.667
And what he&amp;#39;s ensuring is that the American taxpayer,655.988,2.569
gets the best deal possible.,658.557,1.969
"So, he&amp;#39;s asking his team to review those deals and",660.526,2.736
to make sure that we&amp;#39;re going to do all of these,663.262,2.302
things to expedite these projects that go over or,665.564,3.27
"under a piece of, you know, U.S.",668.834,1.402
"soil, that the American taxpayer is considered in",670.236,2.736
"this process, and that we get the best deal for our",672.972,2.169
"country -- not just in terms of jobs, and future",675.141,2.235
"economic growth, and a little bit more energy",677.376,1.769
"security, but also in terms of making sure that",679.145,2.702
"the taxpayers, writ large, who own some of these",681.847,2.403
"lands or access to these lands, and waters, and",684.25,3.27
rivers -- in the case of Dakota -- are -- get the,687.52,4.337
best deal possible.,691.857,1.068
Charlie Spiering.,692.925,0.734
"The Press: As you know, the March for Life is on",693.659,3.036
"Friday, and the President George W.",696.695,2.57
Bush had a tradition of addressing the marchers,699.265,3.67
through a phone call on the mall.,702.935,1.768
Will he be -- will the president be continuing,704.703,3.037

Mr. Spicer: I know Kellyanne is going to,709.208,2.669
attend the event.,711.877,1.669
I think we&amp;#39;re still working through details.,713.546,2.068
But we&amp;#39;ll have further update for you on the,715.614,1.936
president&amp;#39;s potential participation on that.,717.55,1.635
I think it&amp;#39;s no secret the president has campaigned,719.185,3.169
as a pro-life president.,722.354,2.403
"It&amp;#39;s something that is very important to him, as",724.757,2.202
evidenced by the Mexico City policy reinstatement,726.959,2.836
that he issued yesterday.,729.795,1.001
"Obviously, we&amp;#39;re going to have heavy administration",730.796,3.037
presence there.,733.833,0.867
It&amp;#39;s no secret that this administration and this,734.7,2.903
president are going to do what they can to,737.603,1.401
fight for life.,739.004,1.001
With -- the exact participation level of the,740.005,1.902
"president, we&amp;#39;ll find out whether it&amp;#39;s a greeting of",741.907,2.036
"some sort, or a call.",743.943,0.767
I&amp;#39;ll have a further,744.71,1.101
update for you. Cecilia?,745.811,1.435
"The Press: Sean, does the president believe that",747.246,1.401
millions voted illegally in this election?,748.647,2.336
And what evidence do you have of widespread voter,750.983,3.47
"fraud in this election, if that&amp;#39;s the case?",754.453,1.902
Mr. Spicer: The president does believe that.,756.355,1.869
He has stated that before.,758.224,1.001
I think he stated his concerns of voter fraud,759.225,3.003
and people voting illegally during the,762.228,1.768
"campaign, and he continues to maintain that belief",763.996,2.769
based on studies and evidence that people have,766.765,1.769
presented to him.,768.534,0.667
The Press: But exactly what evidence?,769.201,4.138
Mr. Spicer: I --,773.339,0.667
"The Press: Well, Speaker Ryan today said",774.006,1.368
there&amp;#39;s no evidence.,775.374,0.667
The National Association of Secretaries of State,776.041,1.335
say that they don&amp;#39;t agree,777.376,0.667
with the president&amp;#39;s assessment.,778.043,1.335
What evidence do you have?,779.378,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: I -- as I said, I think the",780.045,1.335
"president has believed that for a while, based on",781.38,1.535
studies and information he has.,782.915,1.602
John Roberts.,784.517,0.667
The Press: In the waning hours of the Obama,785.184,2.336
"administration, they quietly transferred a lot",787.52,2.102
"of money out of the country, including $221",789.622,1.501
million to the Palestinian Authority.,791.123,3.904
Does the president -- is the president okay with,795.027,3.437
that transfer?,798.464,0.801
"And if he is not, would he seek to claw back some",799.265,1.835
of that money?,801.1,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think, when it comes to how U.S.",801.767,2.236
"taxpayer money is spent in general, whether it&amp;#39;s",804.003,2.602
"overseas or here at home, you&amp;#39;ve seen through the",806.605,2.336
hiring freeze and other actions that he&amp;#39;s going to,808.941,1.735
"take -- you know, I just mentioned to Steve, I",810.676,2.369
"mean, he is very concerned about how taxpayer money",813.045,3.003
"is spent, whether it&amp;#39;s sent overseas and what we",816.048,3.837
"get for it, in terms of the relationship or our",819.885,2.002
"support, for democracy, or aid to another country",821.887,3.203
for their defenses.,825.09,1.235
But he&amp;#39;s going to be examining all aspects of,826.325,1.468
"the budget, and how we look at all money --",827.793,1.402
because I think that there is a newfound respect for,829.195,2.902
how the American people&amp;#39;s tax dollars are spent in,832.097,2.903
this administration.,835,0.734
"And I think, with his background as it is -- as",835.734,2.736
a businessman -- and one who scrutinizes projects,838.47,3.104
"to bring them under budget, on time, he&amp;#39;s",841.574,2.168
"bringing that business acumen to the White House,",843.742,3.003
to the benefit of the American taxpayer.,846.745,1.402
The Press: Is he okay with that particular transfer?,848.147,3.003
"Mr. Spicer: No, I don&amp;#39;t think I want to",851.15,2.602
go any further.,853.752,0.835
Just say that he is going to make sure that every,854.587,2.369
"deal, every dollar that is spent on behalf of the --",856.956,1.334
by the government is done in a way that respects the,858.29,1.335
American taxpayer.,859.625,0.667
The Press: Sean?,860.292,1.835
"When you were talking about that voter fraud,",862.127,2.103
are you going to ask for an investigation?,864.23,1.568
Is the White House going to formally ask for a,865.798,1.935
probe into this alleged --,867.733,0.968
Mr. Spicer: I think we --,868.701,1.167
The Press: -- voter fraud?,869.868,0.968
"Mr. Spicer: -- he -- won very handily, with 306",870.836,1.902
electoral votes.,872.738,0.667
The Press: Right.,873.405,0.668
Mr. Spicer: Thirty-three states.,874.073,1.368
"He&amp;#39;s very comfortable with his win, but I think --",875.441,1.401
The Press: But it seems to trouble him if he&amp;#39;s,876.842,1.335
bringing it up.,878.177,0.667
That&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m asking --,878.844,1.101
Mr. Spicer: I think he was having a discussion with,879.945,2.036
"some folks and mentioned something in passing,",881.981,1.334
which has been a long-standing belief that,883.315,1.368
he&amp;#39;s maintained.,884.683,0.668
This isn&amp;#39;t the first time they&amp;#39;ve heard,885.351,1.434
this concern of his. Trey?,886.785,0.801
"The Press: It&amp;#39;s not, but I think it&amp;#39;s --",887.586,1.335
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",888.921,0.701
"The Press: -- worth clarifying, whether",889.622,1.334
illegal ballots or illegal immigrants --,890.956,1.368
Mr. Spicer: I think there&amp;#39;s been studies --,892.324,1.335
The Press: -- are [inaudible] --,893.659,1.335
Mr. Spicer: There&amp;#39;s one that came out of Pew in,894.994,1.334
2008 that showed 14 percent of people who have,896.328,1.402
voted were not citizens.,897.73,1.535
There&amp;#39;s other studies.,899.265,0.934
"Mr. Spicer: -- that have been presented to him,",900.199,1.334
it&amp;#39;s a belief he maintains.,901.533,1.335
I don&amp;#39;t -- I mean --,902.868,0.667
The Press: It&amp;#39;s just that they were counted,903.535,1.535
"improperly, as Dick Durbin says the President",905.07,1.735
personally told him last night.,906.805,1.035
It was that the people who (inaudible) --,907.84,1.668
Mr. Spicer: I think -- I think I&amp;#39;ve asked an answer,909.508,2.269
to -- it&amp;#39;s a belief that he&amp;#39;s maintained for a,911.777,2.069
"while, a concern that he has about voter fraud, and",913.846,3.236
that&amp;#39;s based on,917.082,0.768
information that&amp;#39;s provided.,917.85,0.867
"Mr. Spicer: Thanks, Sean .",918.717,1.502
Following President Trump&amp;#39;s executive actions,920.219,1.968
"earlier today, is he concerned about",922.187,1.469
large-scale protests surrounding the,923.656,1.568
construction of the (inaudible) access and,925.224,1.868
"Keystone XL Pipelines like they saw at Standing Rock,",927.092,2.636
and how will he address the concerns of those who,929.728,1.969
oppose those plans?,931.697,0.701
Mr. Spicer: I think he&amp;#39;s going to make sure that he,932.398,2.202
"is looking -- or, working with all parties involved,",934.6,3.17
and that&amp;#39;s part of the -- (inaudible) question.,937.77,2.435
There&amp;#39;s a way that you can continue to negotiate,940.205,1.902
"that, whether it&amp;#39;s Native Americans -- concerns that",942.107,3.37
they have on some of the lands in the Dakota,945.477,3.47
"Pipeline -- I mean, you&amp;#39;re 93% there with Dakota, and",948.947,3.27
I think that the President has shown through his,952.217,3.237
business life that he knows how to negotiate a,955.454,2.002
"great deal where parties come out ahead, and he is",957.456,2.569
willing to sit down with all of the individuals,960.025,2.603
that are involved in the Dakota Pipeline to make,962.628,2.202
sure that it&amp;#39;s a deal that benefits every -- all of,964.83,2.469
"the -- all of the parties of interest, or at least",967.299,2.603
gets them something that they want.,969.902,1.334
"So, that&amp;#39;s part of it. Margaret.",971.236,1.368
"The Press: Oh, say &amp;quot;Mara&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Margaret&amp;quot;?",972.604,1.335
"The Press: No, Margaret.",973.939,0.768
"Mr. Spicer: All right, one at a time. Margaret.",974.707,1.735
(laughter),976.442,0.667
Mr. Spicer: We&amp;#39;ll stick with the M&amp;#39;s for a while.,977.109,1.468
"The Press: I&amp;#39;d like to ask you about Tim Comi , but I",978.577,1.902
also quickly want to follow up on Steve,980.479,2.035
Hollins&amp;#39;s question about the pipelines,982.514,1.402
and the renegotiation.,983.916,0.867
"The President, I think, sort of suggested that",984.783,2.269
some of those renegotiations might -- or,987.052,2.269
"-- negotiations might already be happening, or",989.321,1.735
"that they would start happening, and I&amp;#39;m just",991.056,2.269
"wondering if you could clarify, like, are the",993.325,2.002
mechanisms for that set?,995.327,1.268
Have the discussions already begun?,996.595,1.802
"Mr. Spicer: Well, he just signed the executive order",998.397,2.169
"today, and part of it was that, as he moves things",1000.566,2.502
"forward, he wants to make sure that he gets the best",1003.068,2.269
"deal for the American taxpayer, and works with",1005.337,2.169
"the parties involved, to ensure that people who",1007.506,2.836
might have concerns have an opportunity to come,1010.342,1.735
back to the table and see if there&amp;#39;s a way to --,1012.077,2.67
"The Press: So, for the record, it&amp;#39;s still",1014.747,1.334
being fleshed out --,1016.081,0.668
Mr. Spicer: Yes.,1016.749,0.667
The Press: -- but the negotiations have not,1017.416,1.368
started yet.,1018.784,0.667
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s correct.,1019.451,0.668
"The Press: Jim Comey -- what I wanted to ask was,",1020.119,1.334
could you make it official what was reported by U.S.,1021.453,2.036
"officials all day long, which is that the",1023.489,1.902
President has asked -- has decided he wants Jim Comey,1025.391,2.369
"to stay on, that Jim Comey has confirmed that",1027.76,2.102
he will stay on.,1029.862,0.967
Did they discuss kind of the Russian investigations,1030.829,1.869
and the parameters for that?,1032.698,1.201
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t have anything for that; I don&amp;#39;t,1033.899,1.902
know what the status is.,1035.801,0.901
I&amp;#39;ll have to follow up with the President.,1036.702,1.334
Mara.,1038.036,0.668
The Press: Okay.,1038.704,0.834
Just to question about the executive -- the hiring,1039.538,2.069
freeze yesterday --,1041.607,0.901
Mr. Spicer: Yeah.,1042.508,0.867
"The Press: It doesn&amp;#39;t exempt the V.A., and there",1043.375,2.636
"are 41,500 unfilled medical jobs at the V.A. --",1046.011,2.669
Mr. Spicer: Yeah.,1048.68,0.868
The Press: -- which is really an,1049.548,2.069
extremely large number.,1051.617,0.867
Mr. Spicer: Right.,1052.484,0.868
The Press: The V.A.,1053.352,1.134
was one of his top --,1054.486,1.001
Mr. Spicer: Right.,1055.487,0.768
"The Press: -- priorities, so he&amp;#39;s --",1056.255,1.701
"Mr. Spicer: (inaudible), it&amp;#39;s a freeze.",1057.956,1.535
"And part of it is to ensure it&amp;#39;s -- hold on,",1059.491,2.069
"hold on, hold on.",1061.56,0.667
"What part of it is, is to get our V.A.",1062.227,1.769
"secretary in there, and to figure out how we can best",1063.996,3.036
-- because hiring people when you have a system,1067.032,2.536
"that&amp;#39;s not working, and then just going out and",1069.568,2.035
hiring additional people doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be the,1071.603,2.603
most efficient way of solving the problem.,1074.206,2.502
What we need to do -- whether it&amp;#39;s the V.A.,1076.708,1.902
or any other agency -- is make sure that were hiring,1078.61,2.469
smartly and effectively and efficiently.,1081.079,2.703
And I think the V.A.,1083.782,0.701
in particular -- if you look at the problems that,1084.483,2.502
have plagued people -- hiring more people isn&amp;#39;t,1086.985,2.503
the answer.,1089.488,0.667
"It&amp;#39;s hiring the right people, putting the",1090.155,1.602
procedures in place that ensure that our veterans,1091.757,1.968
"-- whether it&amp;#39;s healthcare, mortgages, or",1093.725,1.769
the other services that the V.A.,1095.494,1.368
"provides to those who have served our nation, get the",1096.862,3.003
services that they&amp;#39;ve earned.,1099.865,1.868
"And right now, the system&amp;#39;s broken.",1101.733,1.969
"So, the freeze is meant to pause, allow there to be",1103.702,3.103
an analysis of what can make this better.,1106.805,2.202
"And it&amp;#39;s not just the V.A., although obviously",1109.007,1.836
that&amp;#39;s high on the president&amp;#39;s list.,1110.843,1.801
But it&amp;#39;s making sure that all of the services of,1112.644,2.403
"government are done in a way that, A, respects the",1115.047,2.469
taxpayer -- what gives the American people the,1117.516,2.002
services or benefit that they truly deserve. So --,1119.518,2.569
The Press: Just to follow up on (inaudible) --,1122.087,2.169
Mr. Spicer: Yeah.,1124.256,0.734
The Press: -- if three to five million people voted,1124.99,2.803
"illegally, that is a scandal of",1127.793,1.435
astronomical proportions.,1129.228,0.667
Doesn&amp;#39;t he want to restore Americans&amp;#39; faith in their,1129.895,1.935
ballot system?,1131.83,0.668
Wouldn&amp;#39;t he want an investigation of this?,1132.498,1.434
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I --",1133.932,1.201
"The Press: I mean, this is a huge, huge scandal.",1135.133,2.37
"Mr. Spicer: -- you know -- but Mara, it&amp;#39;s -- you --",1137.503,2.002
"as I&amp;#39;ve noted several times now, he&amp;#39;s believed",1139.505,2.335
"this for a long time, and I think he won fairly",1141.84,2.336
"overwhelmingly, so he&amp;#39;s not --",1144.176,1.268
"The Press: Well, I&amp;#39;m not",1145.444,1.601
questioning his belief at all.,1147.045,1.569
Mr. Spicer: Well --,1148.614,1.268
The Press: (inaudible) that.,1149.882,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: And -- look, we&amp;#39;ll work --",1150.549,1.335
"The Press: I&amp;#39;m asking you, why not investigate",1151.884,1.368
something that is --,1153.252,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Well, look, maybe we will.",1153.919,1.335
The Press: -- the biggest scandal in American,1155.254,1.334
electoral history?,1156.588,0.668
Three to five million people voting illegally?,1157.256,1.334
Mr. Spicer: And I think that I -- we -- I -- we&amp;#39;ll,1158.59,1.335
"see where we go from here, but right now, the focus",1159.925,1.335
that the president has is on putting Americans,1161.26,1.368
back to work.,1162.628,0.667
It was a comment that he made on a long-standing,1163.295,1.335
belief into that.,1164.63,0.667
Yeah. Yes.,1165.297,0.667
"The Press: During Mr. Trump&amp;#39;s campaign, he",1165.964,2.102
talked a lot about banning Muslims from coming into,1168.066,3.204
"the country, and extreme vetting in this process.",1171.27,2.535
When can we expect him to take action on this?,1173.805,1.869
Mr. Spicer: I think that&amp;#39;s going to be one of the,1175.674,1.568
things that he looks at.,1177.242,1.068
His Department of State -- when Rex Tillerson gets,1178.31,3.237
confirmed -- and some of the other departments and,1181.547,4.137
Homeland Security are trying to put together a,1185.684,1.768
place that enacts this extreme vetting.,1187.452,2.336
But I think the interesting thing about,1189.788,1.401
the question that you&amp;#39;re asking is that we&amp;#39;re,1191.189,3.17
"sitting here today with two confirmed -- or, three",1194.359,3.971
Cabinet -- with Mike Pompeo last night -- we&amp;#39;re,1198.33,2.336
sitting here asking whether the President&amp;#39;s,1200.666,1.434
agenda&amp;#39;s moving forward at a time when Senate,1202.1,2.269
"Democrats are holding up, you know, a massive amount",1204.369,3.037
of this Cabinet.,1207.406,0.667
The Press: Do you think they&amp;#39;re doing,1208.073,1.335
it purposefully?,1209.408,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Oh, absolutely.",1210.075,0.701
There&amp;#39;s no question about it.,1210.776,0.901
"We look at -- look, I -- let&amp;#39;s walk back a second",1211.677,2.869
and remember that the -- Chuck Schumer put out a,1214.546,2.669
statement saying that they had an issue with eight or,1217.215,2.169
nine of them.,1219.384,0.668
"So, that leaves about 12 of them -- 13 -- that they",1220.052,3.169
didn&amp;#39;t have a problem with.,1223.221,0.968
"They were consensus candidates, and while I",1224.189,1.602
think every one of the people that the President,1225.791,2.235
has nominated to serve in his Cabinet is,1228.026,1.769
"unbelievably qualified, even the Democrats",1229.795,2.669
"admitted that, you know, 12 to 13 of them were what",1232.464,3.237
"they called &amp;quot;consensus candidates&amp;quot;, and that they",1235.701,1.801
wouldn&amp;#39;t oppose them.,1237.502,1.135
"And yet here we are, two days in --",1238.637,1.401
The Press: (inaudible) --,1240.038,0.668
Mr. Spicer: Hold on.,1240.706,0.667
The Press: Do you have a message for,1241.373,1.335
those democrats?,1242.708,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Let&amp;#39;s get it done.,1243.375,0.667
"I mean, our country&amp;#39;s economy and safety",1244.042,2.269
is at stake.,1246.311,0.968
We have a continuity of government in place to,1247.279,2.969
ensure that we can continue to protect and,1250.248,1.736
"preserve this country and move business forward, but",1251.984,2.569
"the reason you have a confirmed secretary, or",1254.553,2.169
"director, or administrator, is to make",1256.722,1.902
sure that you can enact the agenda that the,1258.624,1.735
president campaigned on.,1260.359,1.401
And I think that every minute that we stall is a,1261.76,3.136
moment that the Democrats should have to answer for.,1264.896,1.836
Yeah. (inaudible),1266.732,1.468
Mr. Spicer: Okay.,1268.2,1.902
"I&amp;#39;m Anthony Harper , the Intermountain Christian",1270.102,1.635
"Newspaper, and the",1271.737,0.7
Christian Newspaper Association.,1272.437,2.136
"And Israel leaders in the Knesset that I&amp;#39;m aware of,",1274.573,3.07
are concerned about the misuse of U.S.,1277.643,2.102
tax dollars that are going to U.N.,1279.745,2.602
schools that are inciting kids&amp;#39; violence against the,1282.347,5.005
Jews.,1290.255,0.667
What do you think President Trump -- how,1290.922,1.335
would he respond to these Israel leaders --,1292.257,1.635
their M.K.,1293.892,0.667
"leaders, Sharren Haskel, (inaudible), and Dr. Liza",1294.559,1.569
Lebis -- I met -- recently had interviews with them.,1296.128,2.469
Their concerns are very serious -- want to -- they,1298.597,2.469
"would want to know what President Trump -- or, how",1301.066,2.502
he would respond to,1303.568,1.001
the misuse of these (inaudible).,1304.569,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think I would go to what I said",1305.904,2.402
"to John a minute ago, which is that he has",1308.306,2.336
"tremendous respect for how tax dollars are spent, but",1310.642,3.037
"I would mention again -- I mean, we need",1313.679,2.035
a U.N. ambassador.,1315.714,1.201
We need a Secretary of State.,1316.915,1.268
There&amp;#39;s a lot of these things that can start to,1318.183,2.102
happen under the direction of the new leadership,1320.285,2.269
that&amp;#39;s being held up right now.,1322.554,1.135
Mr. Spicer: Thank you.,1323.689,0.934
Mr. Spicer: Tara .,1324.623,0.967
The Press: Is the President open to the idea,1325.59,2.436
"of choosing a mainstream candidate, like some of",1328.026,2.403
the Democratic Congressional leaders are,1330.429,1.401
urging him to do today?,1331.83,1.301
Mr. Spicer: For what?,1333.131,1.201
The Press: For -- sorry -- Supreme Court nominee.,1334.332,2.703
Mr. Spicer: I think that defines -- I think he&amp;#39;s,1337.035,2.336
going to -- he&amp;#39;s been very clear about,1339.371,2.803
his priorities.,1342.174,0.734
He&amp;#39;s put out a list during the campaign of,1342.908,1.535
individuals that he would consider.,1344.443,2.102
"But, I mean, I think it&amp;#39;s pretty mainstream to",1346.545,1.902
"support the Constitution, pretty mainstream to",1348.447,2.769
"respect -- to follow the law, and not to create",1351.216,4.438
laws from the bench.,1355.654,1.868
That&amp;#39;s what I think the majority of Americans,1357.522,1.468
"would agree, and I think, you know, when it comes to",1358.99,1.969
the candidates that he&amp;#39;s put up for his cabinet --,1360.959,2.436
"you know, again, look at the quality can caliber of",1363.395,1.768
these individuals.,1365.163,0.668
That&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s kind of continuing to look for:,1365.831,1.768
"people of high quality, of high caliber, that have",1367.599,2.436
"gone, you know, that fit the philosophy that he",1370.035,3.003
campaigned on.,1373.038,0.801
April.,1373.839,0.667
"The Press: Sean, I&amp;#39;m going to ask you a couple of",1374.506,1.935
"questions, one starting off with Sessions, this",1376.441,2.236
delay in a vote.,1378.677,1.768
Primarily because of concerns about issues of,1380.445,2.603
"civil rights with Sessions, as well as",1383.048,2.069
voting rights.,1385.117,1.234
"Yesterday you talked about issues of race, on dealing",1386.351,4.171
with Congressman John Lewis and his statements --,1390.522,2.302
Mr. Spicer: (affirmative),1392.824,0.701
The Press: -- and also the bus.,1393.525,0.667
What do you say when people are once again,1394.192,1.835
"bringing up the issue of race and voter fraud, when",1396.027,2.503
"it comes to Jeff Sessions, this man that President",1398.53,2.603
Trump has so much faith in to lead the,1401.133,2.602
Justice Department?,1403.735,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think Senator Sessions&amp;#39;s record",1404.402,2.303
on voting and civil rights is exemplary.,1406.705,2.502
He has fought very hard as both an attorney general,1409.207,3.571
"in Alabama, as a U.S.",1412.778,1.368
"attorney, and then as a senator.",1414.146,2.435
"For voting rights, for civil rights, on areas of",1416.581,2.937
"minority rights he has pushed for -- and so, when",1419.518,3.203
"you look at his entire record, the people he",1422.721,1.835
"prosecuted, as both a U.S.",1424.556,2.769
"attorney and an Alabama attorney general, he&amp;#39;s",1427.325,2.937
been very forceful when it comes to making sure that,1430.262,2.636
voting rights and civil rights are enforced,1432.898,3.203
and protected.,1436.101,0.667
"And not just that, but advanced.",1436.768,1.468
"When the Voting Rights Act came up for renewal, he",1438.236,3.07
was a huge champion of it.,1441.306,1.168
"So, it&amp;#39;s not just his record as an attorney, but",1442.474,2.569
as a United States senator he&amp;#39;s been a very forceful,1445.043,3.537
advocate of the -- of the continuation of the,1448.58,3.103
Voting Rights Act. Yes.,1451.683,0.834
"The Press: (inaudible), I&amp;#39;m going to ask a",1452.517,2.069
couple questions.,1454.586,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Oh, okay, I&amp;#39;m sorry.",1455.253,1.402
The Press: Yes. Okay. So --,1456.655,1.568
(laughter),1458.223,0.667
"The Press: I know we&amp;#39;re new to these together, so --",1458.89,2.436
(laughter),1461.326,0.667
The Press: All right.,1461.993,0.734
"So, on the -- on the issue of race, going back -- as",1462.727,2.436
you made a -- you talked a long time yesterday on the,1465.163,2.97
"issue of race, and I wanted to ask you a",1468.133,2.602
couple things.,1470.735,0.701
And I talked to the former head -- excuse me -- the,1471.436,4.037
"current head of the NAACP, who is accusing this",1475.473,3.037
administration of something called,1478.51,1.368
"&amp;quot;stereotyping by omissions&amp;quot;, saying that",1479.878,1.668
the President has met with athletes and entertainers,1481.546,2.703
but yet has not met with civil rights leaders.,1484.249,3.036
"And during his inauguration speech, he",1487.285,2.036
talked about inner cities -- urban areas being,1489.321,2.702
"riddled with gangs, violence, and drugs.",1492.023,2.036
What is the agenda?,1494.059,1.334
What are you planning when it comes to --,1495.393,3.037
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I just -- I -- April, I mean,",1498.43,2.235
"just the other day, he sat down with Martin Luther",1500.665,2.069
"King, Jr. I would call him a civil rights leader.",1502.734,2.503
The Press: And of course his dad was the,1505.237,1.334
(inaudible) --,1506.571,0.668
Mr. Spicer: The third.,1507.239,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think he has done a -- I mean, I",1507.906,1.335
think has done a lot for that.,1509.241,0.667
He -- there&amp;#39;s the pastors that he&amp;#39;s met with.,1509.908,1.368
He has met with a lot of individuals on that issue,1511.276,1.335
throughout the campaign.,1512.611,0.667
"They&amp;#39;ve come up and down the Tower, he&amp;#39;s brought",1513.278,1.335
them in and out of the -- during the campaign and,1514.613,1.334
during the transition.,1515.947,0.668
"They&amp;#39;ve been -- he&amp;#39;s with (inaudible) the other day,",1516.615,1.334
during the prayer service.,1517.949,0.668
There&amp;#39;s a ton of individuals that he&amp;#39;s met,1518.617,1.368
with to talk about this issue.,1519.985,0.667
And I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s something that,1520.652,4.972
he takes lightly.,1533.798,1.068
He talks about it tremendously because it&amp;#39;s,1534.866,1.702
"important to him, both in terms of where this",1536.568,3.637
country must move forward and some of the issues,1540.205,1.702
that face some of minority communities in terms of,1541.907,2.235
"the -- not just education, but jobs and hiring and",1544.142,2.369
healthcare and access to small business lending.,1546.511,2.302
Those are all areas that he&amp;#39;s been very concerned,1548.813,1.836
"with, and that he&amp;#39;s talked about the need to address --",1550.649,2.969
The Press: (inaudible) a whole lot planned.,1553.618,1.669
I mean --,1555.287,0.667
Mr. Spicer: We&amp;#39;re on day two.,1555.954,0.968
The Press: I (inaudible) --,1556.922,0.8
Mr. Spicer: I know you&amp;#39;re all anxious.,1557.722,1.335
I appreciate it.,1559.057,0.701
The Press: -- hundred days.,1559.758,0.734
Mr. Spicer: Huh?,1560.492,0.667
The Press: He made this statement during,1561.159,1.335
the inauguration.,1562.494,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I understand it.,1563.161,0.667
"And we&amp;#39;re on day two, and look what he&amp;#39;s doing.",1563.828,1.335
But I think that you -- when you look at the jobs,1565.163,1.368
"programs -- the Dakota Pipeline, the Keystone",1566.531,2.569
"Pipeline, the things that are going to bring jobs",1569.1,1.869
"back, and good-paying jobs with benefits -- those",1570.969,2.869
"benefit every American, regardless of the",1573.838,1.936
color of your skin.,1575.774,1.234
"And I think that -- you know, he talked to the",1577.008,1.635
labor leaders today about apprenticeships and how we,1578.643,2.803
"can grow the economy,",1581.446,1.468
bring back training centers.,1582.914,1.502
Those benefit every American.,1584.416,1.701
And I think that those are the kind of things that,1586.117,1.869
he&amp;#39;s committed to.,1587.986,0.667
"It&amp;#39;s figuring out, how do we -- how do we look at",1588.653,2.303
"the educational piece to ensure that, as people",1590.956,2.369
"transfer out of one job to another, as technology",1593.325,2.702
"evolves, we prepare people who might have had a",1596.027,2.236
blue-collar job to transfer into a,1598.263,2.302
technology-based job?,1600.565,1.702
But there&amp;#39;s a lot of things that we can do in,1602.267,1.535
"terms of training and retraining, vo-tech, and",1603.802,2.402
"other areas of society that help people advance,",1606.204,2.97
"whether or not -- whether their background or not,",1609.174,1.768
and that&amp;#39;s the kind of stuff that I think will,1610.942,1.735
"help move -- yes, sir.",1612.677,1.869
Mr. Spicer: (inaudible) John.,1614.546,1.368
"The CVO (inaudible) report this morning that said,",1615.914,2.736
"you know, that if the current spending levels",1618.65,2.736
"stay as they are, the government&amp;#39;s going to",1621.386,2.436
spend a -- put the country in another ten trillion,1623.822,2.602
dollars in debt over the next ten years.,1626.424,2.503
Does that reinforce for the President the need to,1628.927,2.803
"cut spending, and if so --",1631.73,1.868
Mr. Spicer: Absolutely.,1633.598,0.934
"Mr. Spicer: I mean, where in the government can he",1634.532,2.436
cut spending enough to make a dent on that?,1636.968,1.668
"Mr. Spicer: Well, look, I think that this is -- the",1638.636,2.036
American people elected the right guy,1640.672,1.468
at the right time.,1642.14,1.835
This is somebody who understands how to cut a,1643.975,2.002
"good deal, how to negotiate a good deal, and",1645.977,2.269
how to watch a -- manage a budget.,1648.246,2.069
You look at how he&amp;#39;s managed himself and his,1650.315,2.169
projects: under budget and under -- either on time or,1652.484,3.503
ahead of time.,1655.987,0.868
That&amp;#39;s the kind of philosophy that he&amp;#39;s,1656.855,1.334
"bringing into this government, into this",1658.189,2.57
"White House, is making sure that not only to we",1660.759,3.436
respect taxpayers and figure out whether or not,1664.195,2.403
we&amp;#39;re talking about the hiring freeze or how we do,1666.598,2.402
"business or how much money we may send in aid, that",1669,2.302
we make sure that the money that we send is,1671.302,1.902
"being used well, the programs that we&amp;#39;re",1673.204,1.936
implementing are done in a way that -- are done in,1675.14,2.836
the most efficiently and effective ways.,1677.976,1.835
But it&amp;#39;s a whole of government process.,1679.811,2.502
"It&amp;#39;s trying to make sure that -- you know, look at",1682.313,1.569
what he did with Boeing and Lockheed,1683.882,1.668
on the plains.,1685.55,1.134
"It&amp;#39;s going in and saying, &amp;quot;We can lower",1686.684,1.736
that price more.,1688.42,0.734
We can negotiate further.&amp;quot;,1689.154,1.568
"It&amp;#39;s why, when Steve asked about the two pipelines,",1690.722,3.17
that he wanted to make sure that he inserted,1693.892,1.668
pieces to say we can negotiate further.,1695.56,1.935
If we can get a better deal out of the American,1697.495,1.769
"taxpayer, if someone&amp;#39;s getting you some of our",1699.264,2.302
lands or our waterways to build something that,1701.566,2.302
"they&amp;#39;re going to profit for, can we find a way to",1703.868,3.137
ensure that the American,1707.005,0.901
taxpayer receives a benefit?,1707.906,2.002
That would go to,1709.908,0.667
the U.S. Treasury.,1710.575,0.667
And there&amp;#39;s a lot of ways that he&amp;#39;s going to,1711.242,1.802
"continue to look at this, whether it&amp;#39;s the, you",1713.044,2.202
"know, money coming in or the money going out.",1715.246,2.036
How do we get a handle on this?,1717.282,1.601
But you couldn&amp;#39;t -- I think that we have the,1718.883,1.569
"right guy at the helm of the country right now,",1720.452,1.635
when it comes to ensuring that our tax dollars are,1722.087,2.769
spent well and our deficits addressed.,1724.856,2.236
One last piece: When it comes to energy,1727.092,1.801
"exploration, it&amp;#39;s not just about energy, not just",1728.893,3.571
about finding new ways to bring energy into this,1732.464,2.636
country.,1735.1,0.767
It&amp;#39;s about new ways of creating economic growth;,1735.867,2.169
looking at ways that our natural resources cannot,1738.036,2.335
just benefit us to become more energy-independent,1740.371,2.937
but can bring money into the treasury to either,1743.308,1.835
"reduce the deficit, create jobs, or whatever -- but",1745.143,2.336
there&amp;#39;s a lot of new ways and a lot of new thinking,1747.479,1.935
that&amp;#39;s going on that he is empowering his team and,1749.414,2.769
"his cabinet to look at and to create jobs, to grow",1752.183,4.505
"the economy, and to bring the deficit down.",1756.688,1.802
"Yes, sir.",1758.49,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Two questions, and both -- I",1759.157,1.835
know you love us.,1760.992,1.268
"But if there are protests again, if the pipeline",1762.26,3.237
"goes through -- last time, during the protests, there",1765.497,2.669
were independent journalists that were,1768.166,2.002
arrested and detained.,1770.168,1.134
Same question I asked the Obama Administration.,1771.302,2.036
Will this administration at least support reporters,1773.338,2.602
in trying to do their job in gathering facts?,1775.94,1.902
Mr. Spicer: You guys know I&amp;#39;m a huge fan.,1777.842,1.568
Mr. Spicer: All right.,1779.41,0.801
God love you.,1780.211,0.668
(laughter),1780.879,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;d like that on the record.,1781.546,1.435
"And then, number two: new congressman, Jane, you",1782.981,2.903
"were asking, out of Maryland, is proposing",1785.884,2.035
that he will sponsor legislation for a national,1787.919,2.903
shield wall.,1790.822,0.901
Your vice president in the past has supported a,1791.723,1.935
national shield wall for reporters.,1793.658,1.802
Will this administration support a national shield,1795.46,1.902
wall for reporters?,1797.362,0.734
Mr. Spicer: I -- that&amp;#39;s a great question.,1798.096,1.334
I know --,1799.43,0.668
-- then-Congressman Pence was a champion of that,1800.098,1.835
when he was in the House.,1801.933,1.201
I have not asked.,1803.134,1.235
That&amp;#39;s a great question.,1804.369,0.834
I&amp;#39;d be glad to follow up with you on that.,1805.203,1.802
"Yes, sir.",1807.005,0.667
"The Press: Richard (inaudible), TV Canada.",1807.672,2.97
"On the Keystone, the initial process took up to",1810.642,3.203
10 years.,1813.845,0.667
How fast does the President want this --,1814.512,1.568
Mr. Spicer: As quick as possible.,1816.08,1.335
"He&amp;#39;s already -- I mean, that&amp;#39;s why this was done",1817.415,1.702
the day it was done.,1819.117,0.767
He wants to make sure that we get this process back,1819.884,2.569
on track and get it moving.,1822.453,1.535
It&amp;#39;s too important for the jobs and economy,1823.988,2.002
of our country.,1825.99,0.668
The Press: But he spoke,1826.658,0.667
with Prime Minister Trudeau.,1827.325,1.001
Did he talk -- did they talk about Keystone?,1828.326,2.236
Mr. Spicer: They talked about setting up an agenda,1830.562,2.402
that would include NAFTA.,1832.964,1.268
I&amp;#39;m sure that will come up in their conversation when,1834.232,1.902
they meet.,1836.134,0.7
"The call that they had was more congratulatory,",1836.834,3.037
setting up the meeting.,1839.871,1.034
"I&amp;#39;m sure when they sit down and meet, and the",1840.905,1.368
"teams meet, that will definitely be",1842.273,1.568
on the agenda.,1843.841,0.668
"Yes, sir.",1844.509,0.667
The Press: One more question.,1845.176,0.667
"Very, very last; promise.",1845.843,1.035
Mr. Spicer: Okay.,1846.878,1.101
"The Press: You know, there&amp;#39;s a tradition the",1847.979,1.868
very first trip outside the country for the,1849.847,1.869
"President, a new President, is",1851.716,1.168
Mexico/Canada.,1852.884,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Right.,1853.551,0.701
The Press: Will this tradition be maintained?,1854.252,1.601
Mr. Spicer: We&amp;#39;ll have further updates.,1855.853,1.335
I&amp;#39;ve announced we&amp;#39;re excited to have Theresa,1857.188,1.335
May come this Friday.,1858.523,0.901
We&amp;#39;ve set up a meeting with both the Prime,1859.424,1.735
"Minister of Canada, the President of Mexico.",1861.159,2.069
I mentioned yesterday Prime Minister,1863.228,1.334
Netanyahu is coming.,1864.562,1.502
We&amp;#39;ve got a lot of interest of people coming.,1866.064,2.068
When we have an update on the President&amp;#39;s first,1868.132,2.57
"foreign trips, we&amp;#39;ll let you know.",1870.702,2.202
"Yes, sir?",1872.904,0.701
The Press: (inaudible).,1873.605,0.834
Mr. Spicer: Okay.,1874.439,0.901
"The Press: Oh, I&amp;#39;m sorry.",1875.34,1.568
A couple follow-ups to yesterday.,1876.908,2.002
"First, you said that the phone call between the",1878.91,2.969
leaders of the U.S.,1881.879,1.402
and Russia is not scheduled yet.,1883.281,2.102
Has it been scheduled?,1885.383,1.435
Mr. Spicer: Not that I&amp;#39;m aware of.,1886.818,2.436
"The Press: Secondly, you also were asked about the",1889.254,3.169
"mil-to-mil (inaudible) in Syria and coordination,",1892.423,2.236
"and you referred us to the Pentagon, which said there",1894.659,2.336
was no such coordination.,1896.995,0.834
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s right.,1897.829,0.834
The Press: Is there any new guidance to that?,1898.663,1.868
"Mr. Spicer: No, I believe that the Pentagon has",1900.531,2.603
fully read that out and stand by.,1903.134,2.302
The Press: (inaudible).,1905.436,0.968
"Mr. Spicer: Come on, that was two.",1906.404,4.071
(laughter),1910.475,0.667
The Press: (inaudible) got one more.,1911.142,1.335
"The Press: No, my real question is --",1912.477,2.335
(laughter),1914.812,0.668
The Press: My real question is a basic one.,1915.48,2.235
We know that the President --,1917.715,1.735
Mr. Spicer: (inaudible) easy one.,1919.45,1.435
The Press: Those were easy.,1920.885,1.468
The President has been what I can only describe,1922.353,2.369
"as viciously, viciously attacked for his attitude",1924.722,4.138
to Russia by his opponents here.,1928.86,2.235
He has withstood those attacks.,1931.095,1.635
But I&amp;#39;m from Russia --,1932.73,1.769
Mr. Spicer: No?,1934.499,1.034
(laughter),1935.533,0.667
The Press: (inaudible).,1936.2,0.734
Mr. Spicer: I couldn&amp;#39;t tell.,1936.934,1.769
The Press: Please explain to us why -- what&amp;#39;s his,1938.703,3.837
logic?,1942.54,0.667
Why&amp;#39;s he doing this?,1943.207,0.935
Why&amp;#39;s he standing firm on wanting to improve -- we,1944.142,4.237
"are happy that he stands firm on that, but please",1948.379,3.137
explain to my audience his reasoning for believing,1951.516,3.637
that we can do it together.,1955.153,1.168
Mr. Spicer: Because I think he&amp;#39;s a good -- a,1956.321,1.634
great dealmaker and he&amp;#39;s going to do what he can to,1957.955,3.137
fight on behalf of this country.,1961.092,1.335
"And if a deal can be found, whether it&amp;#39;s",1962.427,1.801
fighting for American taxpayers or working with,1964.228,2.136
"another country, to protect our national",1966.364,3.57
"security interests or economic interests, he&amp;#39;s",1969.934,2.169
going to make a deal that&amp;#39;s in the best,1972.103,1.335
interest of this country.,1973.438,1.034
Thank you.,1974.472,0.667
"Yeah, Jeff?",1975.139,0.668
The Press: You said that the President believes,1975.807,2.602
that there was voter fraud.,1978.409,1.001
I wonder if you believe that.,1979.41,1.268
You were at the Republican National Committee at the,1980.678,1.702
time and Chief of Staff Reince Priebus was the,1982.38,1.802
Chairman of the RNC at the time.,1984.182,1.334
Do you believe there was widespread voter fraud?,1985.516,1.502
"Mr. Spicer: Listen, my job is not --",1987.018,1.535
The Press: And do you -- how can he be comfortable,1988.553,1.868
with his win if he believes --,1990.421,1.135
Mr. Spicer: He&amp;#39;s very comfortable with his win.,1991.556,1.334
The Press: -- there was three million votes --,1992.89,1.335
maybe he didn&amp;#39;t win (inaudible).,1994.225,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: No, he&amp;#39;s very comfortable with his win.",1995.56,1.735
It&amp;#39;s an electoral-based system.,1997.295,0.667
He got 306 electoral votes; 33 of 50 states,1997.962,2.903
voted for him.,2000.865,0.868
"I think -- look, Jeff, I&amp;#39;ve asked and answered",2001.733,1.768
this question twice.,2003.501,0.868
He believes what he believes based on the,2004.369,1.501
information he&amp;#39;s provided.,2005.87,0.667
"Yes, ma&amp;#39;am?",2006.537,0.668
FeThe Press: (inaudible) --,2007.205,0.7
"The Press: What does that mean for democracy,",2007.905,1.335
"though, Sean?",2009.24,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Thanks, Jeff. Ma&amp;#39;am?",2009.907,1.335
"The Press: If he does believe that, what does",2011.242,1.335
that mean for democracy?,2012.577,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: It means that -- yeah, I&amp;#39;ve answered",2013.244,1.368
your question.,2014.612,0.667
FeThe Press: (inaudible) --,2015.279,0.668
The Press: Have you?,2015.947,0.667
FeThe Press: (inaudible) Perry from (inaudible),2016.614,1.335
Television.,2017.949,0.7
The President&amp;#39;s been meeting with business,2018.649,1.335
leaders.,2019.984,0.667
Are there any plans to target U.S.,2020.651,1.335
multinationals that have significant operations,2021.986,1.402
abroad with more favorable tax regimes?,2023.388,2.202
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think a lot of these countries",2025.59,2.369
you saw yesterday -- and even our automotive,2027.959,3.27
"industry has a lot of presence overseas, if",2031.229,1.935
that&amp;#39;s what you mean.,2033.164,0.667
"I mean, the company -- the first priority that he has",2033.831,3.237
is on U.S.-based companies that are trying to bring,2037.068,2.769
more jobs back or grow here.,2039.837,1.669
"But most of these companies -- I mean,",2041.506,1.334
Johnson and Johnson is clearly a multinational,2042.84,1.569
company; Dow.,2044.409,1.034
You go down the list of the individuals that he,2045.443,2.169
met with yesterday and then you take the auto,2047.612,2.035
industry that was here today -- Ford; Chrysler;,2049.647,2.169
GM -- they all have massive overseas,2051.816,3.07
"investments, and I think part of the problem that",2054.886,5.238
he was talking about is greater market access for,2060.124,2.002
"them, the ability to get into markets that we might",2062.126,1.869
not want -- they may have trouble with.,2063.995,1.935
Yes? Yeah?,2065.93,0.934
(crosstalk),2066.864,0.668
"FeThe Press: Sorry, small follow-up.",2067.532,2.335
Are there any plans to still -- has the President,2069.867,1.936
issued his official invitation to the Prime,2071.803,1.368
Minister of Ireland to come here for the,2073.171,1.534
traditional St. Patrick&amp;#39;s Day celebration?,2074.705,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: No, but I&amp;#39;m going to get on that right",2076.04,1.902
away.,2077.942,0.734
(laughter),2078.676,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Thank you for bringing that up.,2079.343,1.368
I just -- that&amp;#39;s on the list.,2080.711,1.302
Can we write that one down?,2082.013,1.101
Hold on.,2083.114,1.034
Blake?,2084.148,0.668
"The Press: So, to piggyback off that,",2084.816,2.168
yesterday the President met with --,2086.984,1.936
Mr. Spicer: More Irish.,2088.92,0.834
The Press: Not of the Irish.,2089.754,1.301
"Yesterday, the President met with CEOs,",2091.055,2.503
"broad-based; met with union leaders,",2093.558,1.801
broad-based.,2095.359,0.935
"Today, though, he specifically met with auto",2096.294,2.035
leaders.,2098.329,1.335
Why was that his choice as the first industry to meet,2099.664,3.57
"with, and then, taking it broader from that, what is",2103.234,3.203
"the criteria or the policy that the President, the",2106.437,2.269
"administration, has or might develop that will",2108.706,2.936
determine which leaders are brought here to the,2111.642,2.736
White House to meet with the President?,2114.378,1.635
"Mr. Spicer: Well, look, I appreciate the question.",2116.013,2.069
"I think -- again, I keep reminding, we&amp;#39;re",2118.082,1.702
on day two.,2119.784,1.034
We can only have so many meetings in a day and I,2120.818,2.736
think when you look -- just stop and remember,2123.554,2.436
what you just said for a second.,2125.99,1.335
"Yesterday, union leaders, business leaders, a",2127.325,2.169
"bicameral group of folks, executive order action --",2129.494,3.536
his day one is pretty darn robust.,2133.03,2.97
I&amp;#39;m not going to try to -- I&amp;#39;ve gotten out of the,2136,1.635
quantifying game.,2137.635,1.301
"But I think when you compare that to the past,",2138.936,2.636
I bet you that we probably put that up there.,2141.572,2.236
The amount of action that he took and the number of,2143.808,2.736
"folks, that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re going to see a lot more",2146.544,1.735
of.,2148.279,0.667
Today he wanted to sit down with the auto,2148.946,1.402
industry in particular because he thinks that&amp;#39;s,2150.348,2.302
"vital to our manufacturing base, but he&amp;#39;s going to",2152.65,3.637
have a lot of meetings and he&amp;#39;s going to meet with a,2156.287,1.902
lot of folks from a lot of backgrounds who he thinks,2158.189,2.736
have an interest in working with him to enact,2160.925,2.336
an agenda that grows jobs and the economy.,2163.261,1.668
That&amp;#39;s basically -- to your point on the,2164.929,2.135
"criteria, that&amp;#39;s what it is, yeah.",2167.064,1.969
The Press: Does the President have any plans,2169.033,3.103
to change U.S.,2172.136,1.101
policy towards Cuba?,2173.237,1.035
There were a lot of changes that took place in,2174.272,2.802
the last administration.,2177.074,0.868
Any executive orders as it relates to U.S./Cuba,2177.942,2.269
relations?,2180.211,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I would have to follow up with you.,2180.878,1.902
We&amp;#39;ve got nothing that we&amp;#39;re ready to announce,2182.78,1.568
at this point.,2184.348,0.801
"The Press: One more question, Sean, if I may.",2185.149,1.568
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, since I&amp;#39;m doing two.",2186.717,1.602
The Press: That&amp;#39;s right.,2188.319,0.667
"Picking up on what April said, are there any plans",2188.986,2.102
in the near future for the President to meet with,2191.088,3.437
leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus,2194.525,1.935
or the Congressional Hispanic Caucus?,2196.46,1.669
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, I -- as I mentioned -- I think it",2198.129,2.569
might have even been April that asked this yesterday.,2200.698,1.602
But I think that the President started with the,2202.3,3.236
"leadership, as he should -- I think you start with",2205.536,3.137
them.,2208.673,0.667
"Today, the group that he&amp;#39;s meeting is part of the",2209.34,2.769
advice and consent role in the Constitution with,2212.109,2.603
respect to appointing a Supreme Court justice.,2214.712,2.502
"So he&amp;#39;s going through the motions of that, but he is",2217.214,2.336
going -- you are going to see a lot of meetings with,2219.55,3.103
a lot of individuals.,2222.653,1.201
"He welcomes the input, ideas, and advice that",2223.854,2.636
these people are coming in with about how to move his,2226.49,2.203
agenda forward.,2228.693,1.501
This is something that he has really enjoyed not,2230.194,3.103
just during the transition but in the last few days,2233.297,2.136
"of his administration, of hearing the feedback, and",2235.433,3.27
one of the things that&amp;#39;s interesting about the,2238.703,1.501
"meetings is, with the exception of the pool",2240.204,2.269
"spray that opens them up, the President has largely",2242.473,2.736
"just sat and listened, asked questions, tried to",2245.209,2.77
elicit their ideas about what barriers they&amp;#39;re,2247.979,2.435
"facing to hire more people, what the",2250.414,3.704
regulatory or tax impact is on their ability to,2254.118,3.036
create more jobs or to keep manufacturing here in,2257.154,2.536
the United States.,2259.69,1.035
"You&amp;#39;re going to see a lot more of that, and I think",2260.725,1.902
"what he wants to do is further expand, whether",2262.627,2.002
it&amp;#39;s governors or members of different groups within,2264.629,2.702
"the House and the Senate, to come down here and get",2267.331,3.804
their advice and ideas on how to work together and,2271.135,2.703
move an agenda. Yeah?,2273.838,1.101
"The Press: (inaudible), Associated Press.",2274.939,2.269
You had mentioned that the President is commissioning,2277.208,2.102
a review of the Islamic State strategy.,2279.31,2.202
Can you just tell us who exactly is involved in,2281.512,2.436
"that review, how long is it going to take, and what",2283.948,2.235
are some optiosn are being considered?,2286.183,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I don&amp;#39;t want to get too",2287.518,1.735
much in detail.,2289.253,0.667
I think obviously there&amp;#39;s a lot of the key,2289.92,1.802
"individuals, not to get back on my high horse",2291.722,2.269
"here, but I think a lot of the individuals that are",2293.991,1.535
going to be part of that process -- he&amp;#39;s got some,2295.526,2.369
"of his senior staff on that process now, but",2297.895,2.936
"obviously, a Secretary of State, a CIA",2300.831,2.503
"director, a U.N. ambassador.",2303.334,1.335
There&amp;#39;s a lot of folks that have not been,2304.669,3.57
consulted yet because they haven&amp;#39;t been confirmed.,2308.239,2.269
"They have in private, but I think they need to get",2310.508,2.202
"together, get confirmed, get in their respective",2312.71,2.202
"departments/agencies, and be able to help provide --",2314.912,2.336
get with their staff and provide feedback.,2317.248,1.701
Hallie Jackson?,2318.949,0.668
"FeThe Press: Thanks, Sean.",2319.617,0.801
"Two topics for you, if you don&amp;#39;t mind.",2320.418,1.935
Mr. Spicer: Yeah.,2322.353,0.834
"FeThe Press: First one -- and really, not to belabor",2323.187,2.703
a point here -- but you said that the President,2325.89,1.701
"believes, has believed for a while, there is",2327.591,2.036
"widespread voter fraud, but only four days ago did",2329.627,2.035
he get the power of the presidency to be able to,2331.662,1.802
do something about it.,2333.464,1.301
"So, why not definitively say that he will",2334.765,1.969
investigate if he believes and the administration,2336.734,2.669
position is that there was massive voter fraud?,2339.403,1.669
"Mr. Spicer: Well, first of all, the comment that he",2341.072,2.068
"made was three to five million people, you know,",2343.14,3.571
cost -- could have voted illegally based on the,2346.711,2.769
studies that he&amp;#39;s seen.,2349.48,1.835
But he&amp;#39;s very clear that he won the election based,2351.315,2.136
on the 306 electoral votes that he got.,2353.451,2.769
We&amp;#39;re here on day two; I think let&amp;#39;s not prejudge,2356.22,4.371
what we may or may not do in the future.,2360.591,1.335
"FeThe Press: If he had lost, would he be upset?",2361.926,1.334
Mr. Spicer: Of course he&amp;#39;d be upset.,2363.26,1.335
Who wouldn&amp;#39;t be upset if they lost?,2364.595,1.335
"FeThe Press: But he&amp;#39;s not upset -- I mean, about the",2365.93,2.869
voter fraud.,2368.799,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: No, no.",2369.467,0.667
"But I mean, that&amp;#39;s not how the -- the election is",2370.134,1.335
held in our country by electoral votes.,2371.469,1.334
"He won overwhelmingly with 306 electoral votes, the",2372.803,1.568
most of any Republican since Reagan.,2374.371,1.969
He&amp;#39;s very comfortable with the depth and breadth of,2376.34,2.069
the support that he got from the American people,2378.409,1.735

"13 battleground states, the 2600 counties.",2382.68,3.737
"He&amp;#39;s very, very pleased with that.",2386.417,1.635
"FeThe Press: (inaudible) second topic, just quickly",2388.052,2.035
"on the pipelines if you don&amp;#39;t mind, Sean,",2390.087,2.302
(inaudible) topics.,2392.389,0.668

"The Press: On Keystone, when you look at the",2394.992,2.102
"Dakota Access Pipeline as well, given the",2397.094,2.703
"President&amp;#39;s former business ties, his last",2399.797,1.668
financial disclosures show that he did have some,2401.465,1.902
stake in Energy Transfer Partners.,2403.367,1.335
Mr. Spicer: He has sold --,2404.702,1.268
"The Press: The CEO -- he&amp;#39;s sold most of it, but",2405.97,2.035
"there&amp;#39;s still, at least from his last disclosures,",2408.005,2.202
still thousands of dollars that he has.,2410.207,2.069
Can you just reassure the American people that there,2412.276,1.668
isn&amp;#39;t a conflict?,2413.944,1.101
Mr. Spicer: Thousands of dollars for a guy who&amp;#39;s a,2415.045,1.335
multibillionaire isn&amp;#39;t -- I don&amp;#39;t think that,2416.38,1.335
that&amp;#39;s at the top.,2417.715,0.667
I don&amp;#39;t know that that&amp;#39;s true.,2418.382,0.667
The Press: (inaudible).,2419.049,0.768
Mr. Spicer: But I mean -- hmm?,2419.817,1.034
Excuse me?,2420.851,0.668
The Press: To those concerned about potential,2421.519,1.334
"conflicts, what would you say?",2422.853,1.268
Mr. Spicer: I think -- he has no conflicts.,2424.121,1.335
"By law, he can&amp;#39;t have conflicts, and I think the",2425.456,1.768
"President has gone above and beyond, as was",2427.224,2.57
outlined at the press conference a,2429.794,1.334
couple weeks ago.,2431.128,1.168
His effort is to make sure that his focus is entirely,2432.296,2.436
on the American people and bringing back jobs and,2434.732,2.335
growing this economy.,2437.067,1.035
Yes?,2438.102,0.667
The Press: The President recently said he felt NATO,2438.769,2.369
was (inaudible).,2441.138,1.268
Does he share the view of Secretary of Defense James,2442.406,2.102
Mattis who said yesterday Washington has &amp;quot;an,2444.508,2.336
unshakeable commitment to the alliance?&amp;quot;,2446.844,1.668
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think I&amp;#39;ve addressed this",2448.512,1.769
"before, that the President is very clear that as it&amp;#39;s",2450.281,3.537
"structured now in terms of the output of Nato, he",2453.818,2.635
doesn&amp;#39;t feel as though it&amp;#39;s doing what its,2456.453,1.602
"mission was set up to do, or that it&amp;#39;s being",2458.055,2.202
particularly effective.,2460.257,0.935
I think that Secretary Mattis and others have,2461.192,2.636
some ideas about how to reform and make,2463.828,1.968
organizations like NATO more effective and benefit,2465.796,3.037
the amount of money that the United States is,2468.833,1.634
"putting into them, whether it&amp;#39;s NATO or the U.N.",2470.467,2.236
or other organizations like that.,2472.703,1.568
But I think he&amp;#39;s not pleased with what he sees,2474.271,2.803
in terms of the U.S.,2477.074,0.734
contribution and the output that it&amp;#39;s getting.,2477.808,2.002
"Yes, sir?",2479.81,0.667
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",2480.477,1.369
Legislation from Senator Collins and Senator,2481.846,2.168
Cassidy would repeal Obamacare but allow states,2484.014,2.503
"that want to, to opt in, to continue to have it.",2486.517,3.97
Would the President support that type of,2490.487,2.503
"legislation, and if he did, would that go back on",2492.99,3.604
his promise to have a full repeal of the law?,2496.594,3.57
"Mr. Spicer: I think, first and foremost, let&amp;#39;s get",2500.164,2.703
back to what his goal is.,2502.867,0.9
"I mean, he is -- we&amp;#39;re working with Congress.",2503.767,2.236
Some of those conversations started last,2506.003,1.501
night; staff has been working on a plan to,2507.504,2.37
repeal and replace.,2509.874,2.035
"His goal, first and foremost, is to make sure",2511.909,2.602
that we give the American people a healthcare system,2514.511,1.802
"that&amp;#39;s affordable, more accessible, more doctors,",2516.313,2.703
more plans.,2519.016,1.034
That&amp;#39;s what his goal&amp;#39;s going to be.,2520.05,1.335
How a state chooses to implement that -- but I,2521.385,2.469
think right now the idea that we&amp;#39;ve had these,2523.854,2.069
mandates requiring people to get things -- it&amp;#39;s,2525.923,2.769
driven out competition and driven up costs -- is not,2528.692,2.636
"a healthcare system that he is pleased with, and",2531.328,2.269
wants to support the repeal of.,2533.597,1.502
Kristen?,2535.099,0.667
"The Press: Sean, thank you.",2535.766,0.667
"I just want to be clear about this investigation,",2536.433,1.802
because it seems we potentially open the,2538.235,1.368
door for one.,2539.603,0.668
Have you discussed with the President the,2540.271,1.334
possibility of possibly --,2541.605,0.768
Mr. Spicer: Which investigation are you,2542.373,1.635
referring to?,2544.008,0.667
The Press: -- investigating this voter,2544.675,1.401
fraud (inaudible)?,2546.076,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: No, I didn&amp;#39;t.",2546.744,1.101
"No, I did not.",2547.845,0.667
The Press: But you said it&amp;#39;s possible.,2548.512,1.635
Mr. Spicer: Anything&amp;#39;s possible.,2550.147,1.502
The Press: Have you discussed it with him?,2551.649,1.735
"Mr. Spicer: No, I -- I think at some point --",2553.384,2.269
"look, I was asked a question.",2555.653,1.701
There is no investigation.,2557.354,1.302
It&amp;#39;s a -- I said it was possible.,2558.656,3.036
Anything is possible.,2561.692,0.934
It was a hypothetical question.,2562.626,1.268
My point to you is that to ask us on day two -- he,2563.894,3.103
made a comment last night on something he has,2566.997,1.902
"believed and said for a long, long time, and the",2568.899,2.936
question that was asked to me is whether or not --,2571.835,2.203
it&amp;#39;s been asked and answered.,2574.038,0.934
I&amp;#39;m not --,2574.972,0.667
The Press: And I have one on foreign policy.,2575.639,1.335
Mr. Spicer: Sure.,2576.974,1.101
The Press: Does he support -- Israel has,2578.075,1.335
"approved the settlement of 2,500 resettlements.",2579.41,1.334
Does he --,2580.744,0.668
Mr. Spicer: I think that he has asked his team to,2581.412,1.334
get together.,2582.746,0.668
He will meet with -- Israel continues to be a,2583.414,3.97
huge ally of the United States.,2587.384,1.402
He wants to grow closer with Israel to make sure,2588.786,2.402
that it gets the full respect that it deserves,2591.188,1.769
"in the Middle East, and what he&amp;#39;s going to do, as",2592.957,2.569
I mentioned yesterday -- we&amp;#39;re going to have a,2595.526,2.669
meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu.,2598.195,1.602
We&amp;#39;ll continue to discuss that.,2599.797,1.067
The Press: Does he support the expansion,2600.864,1.635
of settlements?,2602.499,0.668
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",2603.167,0.734
"Mr. Spicer: Like I said, we&amp;#39;ll have a conversation",2603.901,1.768
with the Prime Minister.,2605.669,0.834
Thank you.,2606.503,0.668
"Jordan Fabian: Thanks, Sean.",2607.171,0.667
Jordan Fabian from The Hill.,2607.838,2.436
"During the campaign, President Trump said he",2610.274,1.868
wanted to fill up the Guantanamo Bay prison with,2612.142,2.069
&amp;quot;bad dudes&amp;quot; and I&amp;#39;m wondering if the White,2614.211,2.703
House is formulating a plan to do that.,2616.914,2.369
Has the President directed the Armed Forces to start,2619.283,3.203
arresting terrorists overseas and bringing them,2622.486,1.969
to the prison?,2624.455,0.7
Mr. Spicer: We have nothing on that right now.,2625.155,2.636
Yeah?,2627.791,0.668
"The Press: Sean, thanks.",2628.459,1.034
I have two questions related to the Supreme,2629.493,1.635
Court and to the meeting with Senate leadership.,2631.128,2.102
"First, can you talk to us a little bit more about",2633.23,2.87
what the goal of the meeting is?,2636.1,1.835
It sounds like he&amp;#39;s closing in on a decision.,2637.935,2.335
Would he be sharing with them a short list of his,2640.27,2.87
final choices?,2643.14,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to -- look, one",2643.807,2.203
quick correction.,2646.01,0.667
I mentioned two individuals at,2646.677,1.168
the beginning.,2647.845,0.667
"The only attendees are Senators McConnell,",2648.512,1.869
"Schumer, Grassley, and Feinstein.",2650.381,2.636
I falsely mentioned the Whips; they&amp;#39;re not going,2653.017,2.669
to be attending.,2655.686,0.967
"That being said, look, the idea is to hear their",2656.653,3.003
"input on what they want, how far he wants to extend",2659.656,2.97
himself on where he is on his thought process.,2662.626,2.035
But I think he wants to hear what they&amp;#39;re looking,2664.661,1.969
"for in a judge, maybe any ideas that they have.",2666.63,2.336
"The Press: Sean, when Senate Democrats changed",2668.966,3.07
"the filibuster rules in 2013, they specifically",2672.036,2.369
exempted the Supreme Court nominations from that.,2674.405,2.135
Mr. Spicer: Right.,2676.54,0.834
The Press: Would the President encourage Senate,2677.374,2.002
Republicans to consider lowering (inaudible)?,2679.376,1.402
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think that he&amp;#39;s going to appoint",2680.778,2.836
a quality associate justice that hopefully,2683.614,2.202
will achieve overwhelming support.,2685.816,2.269
I think his goal is that he&amp;#39;s going to choose,2688.085,2.402
"someone who hopefully, I think, everybody",2690.487,1.969
recognizes is a jurist that&amp;#39;s going to adhere to,2692.456,2.603
"the Constitution and not legislate from the bench,",2695.059,4.037
and that will achieve bipartisan support.,2699.096,2.269
The Press: (inaudible) frustration with the,2701.365,2.703
nomination process so far.,2704.068,1.201
Is that something he would recommend to Republicans,2705.269,1.334
that they consider?,2706.603,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: Look, I think we&amp;#39;re early",2707.271,1.334
in this process.,2708.605,0.668
He&amp;#39;s going to hear from them tonight.,2709.273,1.368
I want to thank you all.,2710.641,0.767
I&amp;#39;ll see you all tomorrow.,2711.408,0.868
Take care.,2712.276,0.667
Have a good one.,2712.943,2.402
