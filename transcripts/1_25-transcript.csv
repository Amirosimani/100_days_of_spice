"Mr. Spicer: Hey guys, good afternoon.",0,3.603
We moved up the briefing a little bit today in,3.603,3.27
deference to the President&amp;#39;s visit to the,6.873,2.202
Department of Homeland Security.,9.075,1.335
As soon as he gets going over there I&amp;#39;m going to,10.41,2.235
wrap up so we&amp;#39;ve got a little while together.,12.645,2.77
But we&amp;#39;ll try to make sure that in deference to his,15.415,3.103
remarks when he gets there we&amp;#39;ll wrap it up.,18.518,1.835
"After briefing yesterday, the President brought",20.353,3.337
leaders of both parties together to discuss his,23.69,2.102
next nomination to the Supreme Court.,25.792,2.903
It&amp;#39;s an incredibly productive conversation as,28.695,1.868
you can see from the President&amp;#39;s tweets.,30.563,1.936
He will announce that nomination next Thursday.,32.499,2.335
The President also spoke with Prime Minister Modi,34.834,2.703
of India yesterday.,37.537,0.934
"Unfortunately, I wasn&amp;#39;t able to give you a read",38.471,2.102
out during the briefing.,40.573,0.935
"So, let me just let you know that during the call",41.508,2.302
the President emphasized that the United States,43.81,2.436
continues to consider India a true friend and,46.246,2.269
partner in addressing challenges,48.515,2.002
around the world.,50.517,1.101
The two discussed opportunities to,51.618,1.468
strengthen the partnership between the United States,53.086,2.035
and India in a broad area such as the,55.121,2.603
economy and defense.,57.724,1.702
They also discussed security in the region of,59.426,2.268
South and Central Asia.,61.694,2.703
President Trump and Prime Minister Modi resolved,64.397,1.769
that the United States and India should stand,66.166,1.568
shoulder to shoulder in the global fight,67.734,2.169
against terrorism.,69.903,1.334
And President Trump looks forward to hosting Prime,71.237,2.169
Minister Modi in the United States,73.406,1.635
later this year.,75.041,1.368
"Today, the President is focused on fulfilling one",76.409,2.302
of his most significant campaign promises to the,78.711,3.604
American people by making America safe again.,82.315,2.903
By taking steps to secure our borders and improve,85.218,2.436
immigration enforcement inside the United States.,87.654,3.203
The President intends to sign two executive orders,90.857,2.803
after observing the swearing in of Secretary,93.66,2.836
of Homeland Security Kelly.,96.496,1.268
The first order is the border security and the,97.764,4.705
immigration enforcement improvements.,102.469,2.369
It addresses long overdue border security issues and,104.838,3.136
the first order in that will be to build a large,107.974,3.37
physical barrier on the southern border.,111.344,2.903
Building this barrier is more than just a campaign,114.247,1.902
promise it&amp;#39;s a common sense first step to really,116.149,4.237
securing our poorest border.,120.386,2.069
"This will stem the flow of drugs, crime, illegal",122.455,2.87
"immigration, into the United States.",125.325,2.435
"And, yes, one way or another, as the President",127.76,2.069
"has said, Mexico will pay for it.",129.829,2.336
The executive order also provides the dedicated men,132.165,2.769
and women of the Department of Homeland,134.934,1.902
Security with the tools they need -- the tools and,136.836,3.37
the resources they need to stop illegal immigration,140.206,2.736
from entering the United States.,142.942,2.269
Under the Constitution the American people get the,145.211,2.269
final say who can and cannot enter our nation.,147.48,3.037
And they&amp;#39;ve spoken loud and clearly,150.517,1.368
through our laws.,151.885,1.101
We&amp;#39;re going to create more detention space for,152.986,1.735
illegal immigrants along the southern border to,154.721,2.302
make it easier and cheaper to detain them and return,157.023,2.469
them to their country of origin.,159.492,1.735
We&amp;#39;re going to end the last administrations,161.227,2.303
dangerous catch and release policy which has,163.53,2.435
led to the deaths of many Americans.,165.965,2.836
We&amp;#39;re going to once again prioritize the prosecution,168.801,2.47
and deportation of illegal immigrants who&amp;#39;ve also,171.271,2.636
otherwise violated our laws.,173.907,2.335
And after these criminals spend time in prison for,176.242,2.069
the crimes they&amp;#39;ve committed they&amp;#39;re going to,178.311,1.702
get back one way tickets,180.013,1.301
to the country of their origin.,181.314,1.602
And their governments are going to take them back.,182.916,2.302
The second executive order enhancing public safety in,185.218,2.836
the interior of the United States address the,188.054,2.903
enforcement of our immigration laws,190.957,1.635
in the United States.,192.592,1.802
And returns the power and responsibility to the,194.394,2.802
dedicated men and women of the Department of Homeland,197.196,3.003
Security&amp;#39;s immigration and custom enforcement to help,200.199,3.137
them enforce the law.,203.336,1.668
These men and women want to enforce the law and,205.004,2.336
we&amp;#39;re going to help them do that.,207.34,1.802
Federal agencies are going to unapologetically,209.142,3.036
enforce the law.,212.178,1.034
"No ifs, ands, or buts.",213.212,3.003
We&amp;#39;re going to restore the popular and successful,216.215,3.504
secure community&amp;#39;s program which will help ICE agents,219.719,3.17
target illegal immigrants for removal.,222.889,2.569
The State Department is going to withhold visas,225.458,1.969
and use other tools to make sure countries except,227.427,3.036
and return the criminals,230.463,1.602
that came from their country.,232.065,1.835
We&amp;#39;ll insure that these countries take those,233.9,1.802
individuals back and we&amp;#39;re going to strip federal,235.702,2.535
grant money from the sanctuary states and,238.237,1.702
cities that harbor illegal immigrants.,239.939,2.87
The American people are no longer going have to be,242.809,3.27
forced to subsidize this disregard for our laws.,246.079,4.07
Reform of our immigration system has been at the top,250.149,2.169
of President Trump&amp;#39;s priority since he,252.318,2.269
announced his candidacy.,254.587,0.968
Now in just the final first week -- or excuse me,255.555,3.837
"just in the first week, we&amp;#39;re not there yet, of",259.392,2.502
his presidency the last administration will,261.894,3.104
enforce the rule of law and restore value to the,264.998,1.935
American citizenship our greatest asset in,266.933,1.802
the 21 century.,268.735,1.501
As to the rest of the day&amp;#39;s schedule this,270.236,1.602
morning the President started off his day in the,271.838,1.735
Oval Office carrying out some official duties.,273.573,2.402
This morning he had the honor to greet now,275.975,5.005
Ambassador to the U.N.,280.98,1.368
Nikki Haley in his office after the Vice President,282.348,2.703
swore her in his ceremonial office,285.051,3.036
across the street.,288.087,1.201
As one of the most respected governors in the,289.288,1.702
country Ambassador Haley has a proven track record,290.99,2.536
of bringing people together regardless of,293.526,1.802
their background or differences to create,295.328,2.302
opportunities for bettering her state and,297.63,1.935
now our nation.,299.565,1.368
"The President is pleased that Ambassador Haley, to",300.933,2.002
"the best of my knowledge at least, is our nation&amp;#39;s",302.935,3.037
first Indian American cabinet level officer.,305.972,3.603
That&amp;#39;s a big deal for Indian Americans,309.575,2.636
throughout this country.,312.211,1.535
And now she is able to get to work representing our,313.746,2.336
nation as our nation&amp;#39;s top diplomat.,316.082,3.136
In just a few minutes the President will be,319.218,1.635
departing the White House to visit the Department of,320.853,1.836
Homeland Security.,322.689,1.267
Where he&amp;#39;ll as I mentioned he will attend the,323.956,1.502
swearing in of Secretary Kelly.,325.458,1.335
Will then be briefed by FEMA on the storm relief,326.793,2.669
efforts in the Southeast and conduct other related,329.462,2.703
business specific to keeping our nation safe.,332.165,3.136
Secretary Kelly has dedicated his life to,335.301,1.902
"protecting our country, enlisting in the Marine",337.203,2.069
"Corp in 1970, commanding at every level from",339.272,2.903
platoon commander through the Corp level and,342.175,2.769
combatant command.,344.944,1.301
He has a sincere commitment to fighting the,346.245,1.669
threat of terrorism inside of our country and ending,347.914,2.669
the dangerous flow of illegal immigrants,350.583,1.835
through our borders.,352.418,1.168
The President is looking forward to working with,353.586,1.869
Secretary Kelly to implement his plans to,355.455,2.502
restore our borders and protect our country.,357.957,3.036
"For everyone keeping score at home, this brings us up",360.993,2.269
to four total confirmations of our,363.262,2.369
cabinet or cabinet level appointees.,365.631,1.836
And as a reminder the Obama administration had,367.467,2.802
12 done at the end of their first week.,370.269,2.269
"So, needless to say we think Senate Democrats",372.538,2.77
should continue to spend some quality time getting,375.308,2.836
our nominations moved out of the Senate.,378.144,2.169
This afternoon the President will have his,380.313,2.035
final event -- public event anyway by speaking,382.348,3.537
on the phone with,385.885,0.667
Mississippi Governor Bryant.,386.552,1.635
They&amp;#39;re going to discuss storm relief and recovery,388.187,1.835
efforts underway in Mississippi and any,390.022,2.503
help that the Governor,392.525,1.468
needs from the federal government.,393.993,2.236
Today the President also announced the appointment,396.229,2.202
of an incredibly qualified team to serve under the,398.431,2.569
guidance of White House Counsel Don McGahn to,401,2.536
address compliance and ethics matters.,403.536,2.803
"This team consist of Stefan Passantino, Deputy",406.339,3.503
Assistant to the President and Deputy General Counsel,409.842,1.969
"to the President, Udan Dillion, Scott Gast and",411.811,3.136
James Schultz as special assistants to the,414.947,2.403
President and associate counsel.,417.35,1.835
Together these esteemed lawyers have decades of,419.185,2.235
"experience in political counsel serving Senators,",421.42,3.003
"members of Congress, Congressional Committees,",424.423,1.736
"governors, and federal agencies.",426.159,2.268
The appointment of a team of this caliber at such a,428.427,2.069
high level reflects the critical importance of,430.496,2.67
ethics compliance to President Trump and,433.166,1.668
his administration.,434.834,1.335
Stefan has received the highest praise from party,436.169,2.736
leaders of both sides from whom he has worked with.,438.905,3.336
As former Gingrich said no one understands the ethics,442.241,2.269
process better than Stefan.,444.51,1.335
And as you saw from his tweet this morning the,445.845,2.536
President is looking into various options to,448.381,1.835
address voter fraud.,450.216,1.368
"On Thursday, he&amp;#39;ll travel to Philadelphia for a",451.584,2.703
retreat with Congressional Republicans.,454.287,1.568
Where in addition to discussing his legislative,455.855,2.369
agenda he&amp;#39;ll also provide an update on the actions,458.224,2.903
that he is going to be taking in the,461.127,1.368
next few days.,462.495,0.801
"And finally, before you ask, because I know it&amp;#39;s",463.296,2.235
an issue that&amp;#39;s near and dear to me.,465.531,2.936
I was asked yesterday about the status of the,468.467,2.503
invitation of Prime Minister Kenny from,470.97,3.537
Ireland to visit the United States on,474.507,1.568
St. Patrick&amp;#39;s Day.,476.075,1.301
And I&amp;#39;m pleased to announce that the,477.376,1.335
President has extended that invitation.,478.711,2.202
It happened actually during the transition,480.913,1.635
period and we look forward,482.548,1.435
to the Prime Minister attending.,483.983,3.136
"With that I&amp;#39;d love to take some questions, Dave Boyer",487.119,2.67
Washington Times.,489.789,0.767
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",490.556,1.035
Can you shed any light on this draft memo that&amp;#39;s,491.591,2.702
going around about interrogation practices in --,494.293,3.17
"Mr. Spicer: Right, yes, I can lend a lot.",497.463,1.769
The Press: -- what agency did it originate in?,499.232,1.334
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know it is not a,500.566,1.368
White House document.,501.934,0.701
The Press: Did the White House --,502.635,1.335
Mr. Spicer: And I would just urge those people,503.97,1.334
"that have reported on it, this is now I think the",505.304,2.136
second day that we&amp;#39;ve had a document that was not a,507.44,1.968
White House document get,509.408,1.402
reported on as a factual document.,510.81,2.636
It is not a White House document.,513.446,1.835
I have no idea where it came from.,515.281,2.302
But it is not a White House document.,517.583,1.368
The Press: Did the President direct that it,518.951,1.568
be drafted in the first place?,520.519,1.369
Mr. Spicer: No.,521.888,1.134
I mean as I said it is not a White House document.,523.022,3.103
"So, I&amp;#39;m not sure where it came from or how it",526.125,2.669
originated but it is not a White House document.,528.794,2.103
I don&amp;#39;t know who much clearer I can say that.,530.897,2.102
Laurie Montenegro from Telemundo.,532.999,1.668
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",534.667,1.568
With regards to the executive order the,536.235,2.469
President will be signing,538.704,1.402
"today, with regards to the wall.",540.106,2.102
It&amp;#39;s already been estimated that it will,542.208,2.469
cost billions of dollars has the administration,544.677,2.436
figured out how Mexico will pay for this?,547.113,2.803
And do you have any guarantee from Republicans,549.916,2.836
in Congress that they will provide all the funding,552.752,3.136
necessary to see this project come,555.888,2.102
to completion?,557.99,0.701
"Also, about two days ago, you were",558.691,2.469
asked about Dhaka?,561.16,1.034
Mr. Spicer: Yeah.,562.194,1.068
The Press: And some of the dreamers as they are known,563.262,3.837
have lots of questions regarding what,567.099,2.136
is their future?,569.235,1.034
Mr. Spicer: Right.,570.269,1.068
The Press: I mean do they continue to apply those,571.337,3.503
"that have applied for renewal, will their",574.84,2.436
applications be processed?,577.276,1.068
And with regards to stripping funding from the,578.344,2.803
sanctuary cities what funding&amp;#39;s are we talking,581.147,2.435
about with regards to that?,583.582,1.769
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s a good question.,585.351,2.102
Thanks Laurie.,587.453,0.701
With respect to the last part of that first.,588.154,3.17
What the executive order does is it directs the,591.324,3.136
Secretary to look at funding streams that are,594.46,2.97
going to these cities of federal monies and figure,597.43,2.569
out how we can de-fund those streams.,599.999,1.969
"So, part of this is a directive to the Secretary",601.968,3.636
to look at those funding streams and then figure,605.604,2.403
out how they can be cut off.,608.007,0.901
"So, that&amp;#39;s what the actual order directs them to do.",608.908,2.936
"The first part with respect to Dhaka, I&amp;#39;ve",611.844,2.102
"talked about this a couple of days, the order today",613.946,2.703
doesn&amp;#39;t specifically deal with that.,616.649,1.501
We will have further updates on the rest of the,618.15,2.269
President immigration agenda further,620.419,2.102
in the week.,622.521,0.801
"But as I&amp;#39;ve mentioned before, I think the",623.322,1.902
President will talk about it in an interview,625.224,2.202
"tonight, but his priority is first and foremost",627.426,2.77
people who are in this country that seek,630.196,1.501
to do us harm.,631.697,1.068
And he understands -- I mean the President,632.765,3.303
understands the magnitude of this problem.,636.068,1.802
"He&amp;#39;s a family man, he understands, he has",637.87,1.802
a huge heart.,639.672,1.034
And he understands the significance of,640.706,1.969
this problem.,642.675,1.501
But he&amp;#39;s going to work through it with his team,644.176,2.369
in a very humane way to make sure that he respects,646.545,3.671
"the situation that many of these children are in,",650.216,3.436
that were brought here.,653.652,1.802
But his priority with respect to immigration is,655.454,2.036
first and foremost making sure that people who are,657.49,2.836
in this country that are seeking to do us harm or,660.326,2.636
have committed a crime are at the forefront of that.,662.962,2.469
Francesca Chambers.,665.431,1.134
The Press: On the border and the wall has the,666.565,3.871
administration figured out how Mexico will pay,670.436,1.935
for it and has --,672.371,0.801
"Mr. Spicer: No, I think the President is working",673.172,1.501
with Congress and other folks to figure out,674.673,2.436
opportunities for that to happen.,677.109,1.669
There are a lot funding,678.778,0.9
mechanisms that can be used.,679.678,1.936
A this point his goal was to get the project started,681.614,3.069
as quickly as possible using existing funds and,684.683,2.603
resources that the department currently has.,687.286,2.87
And then to move forward and work with Congress on,690.156,2.335
an appropriations schedule.,692.491,1.135
But you know again were here at day three it&amp;#39;s an,693.626,2.869
issue that he has brought up several times with,696.495,2.336
Congress in terms of making sure that we,698.831,2.002
understand -- that they understand the need to,700.833,2.569
make that&amp;#39;s included,703.402,0.934
in the appropriations process. Francesca.,704.336,1.869
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",706.205,1.668
Could you give us a little bit more of a read out of,707.873,4.238
yesterday&amp;#39;s meeting with Senators about the Supreme,712.111,2.302
Court Justice nominee?,714.413,0.968
How was that list perceived specifically by,715.381,2.302
Democrats and has the President whittled it down,717.683,2.603
to three names or one name as were hearing?,720.286,2.936
Mr. Spicer: The President has not whittled it down,723.222,2.903
at least not to the extent that he&amp;#39;s willing to,726.125,2.069
share with us.,728.194,1.134
Maybe in his mind he&amp;#39;s got that going.,729.328,1.602
But he&amp;#39;s going through the process he had a very,730.93,3.603
constructive and productive conversation,734.533,2.336
with the Senate&amp;#39;s leaders yesterday about the advice,736.869,3.337
and consent role they have.,740.206,1.434
"Getting their ideas, the principles",741.64,2.136
that they expect.,743.776,0.767
And he was sharing with them his -- the qualities,744.543,4.672
and values that he expects in a judge to serve on,749.215,2.869
the Supreme Court.,752.084,1.001
I&amp;#39;m not going to go further than that but I,753.085,1.568
would just say it was a very productive and,754.653,1.335
instructive meeting.,755.988,1.068
Eli Stokols.,757.056,0.801
The Press: Last night National Parks published,757.857,3.003
tweets that were scientific facts about,760.86,2.569
climate change.,763.429,0.867
And then those tweets,764.296,1.702
disappeared shortly after that.,765.998,1.201
"So, I&amp;#39;m wondering if this White House had anything",767.199,1.902
to do with that?,769.101,1.068
And if there&amp;#39;s a broader as it&amp;#39;s been reported by,770.169,2.669
"some organizations, if there is a broader mandate",772.838,2.136
going out to federal agencies about you know,774.974,2.302
stopping all things speech coming,777.276,1.668
from those agencies?,778.944,0.968
"Mr. Spicer: No, there&amp;#39;s nothing that&amp;#39;s come",779.912,1.902
from the White House.,781.814,1.034
Absolutely not.,782.848,0.668
I think in some cases I know in the Park Service,783.516,2.769
"for example, over the weekend somebody who -- an",786.285,3.136
unauthorized user had an old password in the San,789.421,3.704
"Francisco office, went in and started re-tweeting",793.125,3.137
inappropriate things that were in violation,796.262,2.035
of their policy.,798.297,1.068
"So, that again, remember I know this happened in the",799.365,4.471
-- and the EPA is another example I think of some,803.836,2.536
social media contact.,806.372,1.401
The EPA actually violated the anti-deficiency act,807.773,2.736
"and the anti-lobbying bans, I think it was a",810.509,1.902
"year ago, during the Obama administration.",812.411,2.87
Inappropriately marketing,815.281,1.201
some polices of President Obama.,816.482,2.302
And I think there&amp;#39;s a couple of these agencies,818.784,3.003
that have had problems,821.787,0.801
adhering to their own polices.,822.588,1.935
And I would refer you back to them as to why those,824.523,4.304
things are happening.,828.827,0.668
But I know that they are taking steps in both of,829.495,1.635
those two cases to address inappropriate use of,831.13,4.071
social media. Yeah.,835.201,2.202
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",837.403,1.268
Has the President reached out to Mayor Emanuel or,838.671,2.836
any or any Chicago law enforcement authorities to,841.507,2.536
discuss the concerns that he expressed in his,844.043,2.536
tweet last night?,846.579,0.934
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I mean he met with Mayor Emanuel",847.513,2.269
during the transition.,849.782,2.102
"Expressed to him his support for the city, the",851.884,5.572
need to deal with the crime and the killings,857.456,3.036
that are occurring in Chicago.,860.492,1.068
And I think when President Obama was speaking his,861.56,2.936
"farewell address the other day, two",864.496,1.335
people were killed.,865.831,1.201
The same day that the President was,867.032,2.036
in his home city.,869.068,0.667
And I think the President elect at the time extended,869.735,4.838
his support to Mayor Emanuel to say that the,874.573,3.003
resources of the federal government,877.576,1.435
are here for you.,879.011,1.168
To the best of my knowledge that return call,880.179,3.136
for help has not occurred.,883.315,1.001
"Yeah, John.",884.316,3.437
John Roberts.,887.753,0.667
The Press: Sean if I -- Mr. Spicer: Lynn I will,888.42,3.237
"get to you but that was very, very, enthusiastic",891.657,2.402
and I appreciate it.,894.059,1.035
(laughter),895.094,0.667
You&amp;#39;re getting an award today. John.,895.761,3.07
The Press: Speak up Lynn.,898.831,0.734
The Press: For the record I very much appreciate it.,899.565,2.135
With respect to Lynn.,901.7,2.069
You mentioned this morning the President has brought,903.769,1.835
"this up in the news again, that he wants to launch an",905.604,2.069
investigation into voting irregularities --,907.673,2.336
Mr. Spicer: Right.,910.009,0.667
The Press: in the 2016 election.,910.676,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: Yes, but -- let&amp;#39;s be clear",912.011,1.368
not just in 2016.,913.379,0.667
I think in terms of registration where you&amp;#39;ve,914.046,1.568
got folks on roles that have been deceased or,915.614,3.504
moved or registered in two counties.,919.118,1.501
This isn&amp;#39;t just about the 2016 election this is,920.619,1.969
about the integrity of our voting system.,922.588,2.135
The Press: There were studies that back up what,924.723,1.936
he tweeted out this morning to suggest that,926.659,1.601
people are registered in multiple states --,928.26,1.468
Mr. Spicer: Right.,929.728,0.668
The Press: -- and that people who are dead are,930.396,1.334
still on the roles.,931.73,0.668
But attorneys who are representing the President,932.398,2.102
"elect during the recounts in several states,",934.5,2.469
"emphatically stated, &amp;quot;All available evidence",936.969,2.469
suggested the 2016 election was not tainted,939.438,2.636
"by fraud or mistake.&amp;quot; So, how do you square",942.074,2.002
those two things?,944.076,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I think there&amp;#39;s a lot of states,944.743,3.871
that we didn&amp;#39;t compete in where that&amp;#39;s not,948.614,1.334
necessarily the case.,949.948,0.668
"You look at California and New York, I&amp;#39;m not sure",950.616,1.368
that those statements were -- we didn&amp;#39;t look at those,951.984,1.335
two states in particular.,953.319,1.067
"I mean as the President has noted before, he",954.386,2.036
"campaigned to win the electoral college, not",956.422,3.036
the popular vote.,959.458,1.001
"He campaigned in places like Iowa, he campaigned",960.459,2.202
extensively to win Maine too.,962.661,2.403
And I think if you were a campaigning to win the,965.064,1.501
popular voter you don&amp;#39;t spend -- you know with all,966.565,1.902
"due respect to my brethren in New England, you don&amp;#39;t",968.467,2.336
spend a lot of time in Maine too.,970.803,2.102
To get that one electoral vote.,972.905,1.902
"You would have campaigned more in California, which",974.807,1.935
"he didn&amp;#39;t, you would have campaigned more in New",976.742,1.501
"York, which he didn&amp;#39;t.",978.243,1.435
"There are big states, very populous states, in urban",979.678,2.97
"areas, where you would have spent",982.648,1.368
more time campaigning.,984.016,1.802
But he played the game according to the rules of,985.818,2.102
"the game, which is an electoral strategy.",987.92,1.835
That being said I think when you look at where a,989.755,2.736
lot of potential of the -- where a lot of these,992.491,2.703
"issues could have occurred in bigger states, that&amp;#39;s",995.194,2.702
where I think we&amp;#39;re going to look.,997.896,1.368
But I think that there will be more on that as,999.264,1.335
the week goes on and we&amp;#39;ll be able to,1000.599,1.335
examine that further.,1001.934,0.667
The Press: And before I cede the floor,1002.601,1.869
there&amp;#39;s the list.,1004.47,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sorry you&amp;#39;re right.,1005.137,1.368
The Press: May I ask one question about the EPA and,1006.505,2.703
other departments that have been told to cease,1009.208,1.935
and desist in terms of social media --,1011.143,1.602
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, just to be clear,",1012.745,1.668
I&amp;#39;m not saying that --,1014.413,1.001
The Press: -- forces then --,1015.414,1.234
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, hold on. Zero --",1016.648,1.669
The Press: I have one more question.,1018.317,1.435
"Mr. Spicer: Okay, but I think I need to make sure",1019.752,2.268
that were clear on this John.,1022.02,1.335
They haven&amp;#39;t been directed by us to do anything.,1023.355,2.836
I think from what I understand is that they&amp;#39;ve,1026.191,3.17
been told within their agencies to adhere to,1029.361,2.069
their own policies.,1031.43,1.301
But that directive did not come from here.,1032.731,1.602
The Press: But the question is does this,1034.333,1.501
President believe that these agencies and some of,1035.834,2.903
the federal work force has become politicized?,1038.737,2.036
Mr. Spicer: I honestly don&amp;#39;t know that we spent a,1040.773,2.268
ton of time thinking of that.,1043.041,1.268
That we&amp;#39;ve been fairly busy on other things.,1044.309,3.637
"It&amp;#39;s a good question, I have not asked",1047.946,2.036
him that question.,1049.982,1.001
I think our focus has pretty much been getting,1050.983,2.602
"the job done, as you&amp;#39;ve seen through the meetings",1053.585,2.203
"that he&amp;#39;s had, the work that he&amp;#39;s had with members",1055.788,1.501
"of Congress, union workers, the auto heads,",1057.289,2.536
the other business leaders.,1059.825,1.234
I mean his focus has been much more focused on,1061.059,3.771
getting the job done then various tweets that are,1064.83,2.736
getting deleted and un-deleted.,1067.566,1.468
"Hold on, sorry, Lynn Sweet.",1069.034,3.003
Not that I want to encourage anyone,1072.037,1.502
else to yell.,1073.539,0.767
(laughter),1074.306,0.667
"The Press: This is so important to Chicago, so",1074.973,2.369
thank you so much.,1077.342,1.235
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sure.,1078.577,1.235
The Press: And President Trump has talked a lot,1079.812,2.769
about Chicago.,1082.581,0.667
"So, my question is, he said if Chicago doesn&amp;#39;t",1083.248,2.703
fix the horrible carnage I will send in the feds.,1085.951,3.036
Can you perhaps share with me a little bit about what,1088.987,3.37
is the nature of the federal help that the,1092.357,2.77
"President has in mind, agents, law enforcement",1095.127,2.135
"agents, or National Guard?",1097.262,1.235
And what factors will determine if he acts --,1098.497,2.769
Rahm&amp;#39;s people told us after the meeting in Trump,1101.266,2.736
"Tower on December 7, he did tell them things that",1104.002,3.07
"would help Chicago that he could use, such as summer",1107.072,3.07
"jobs, more prosecutions, and gun laws.",1110.142,1.835
Mr. Spicer: I think what the President is upset,1111.977,2.836
about is turning on the television and seeing,1114.813,2.302
Americans get killed by shootings.,1117.115,2.403
Seeing people walking down the street and,1119.518,1.368
getting shot down.,1120.886,0.667
The President of the United States giving his,1121.553,1.335
farewell address and two people being,1122.888,1.335
killed that day.,1124.223,0.667
And when you look at a city like that he&amp;#39;s had,1124.89,5.005
conversations with police officers in Chicago and,1132.865,2.769
asked them you know what is preventing you from,1135.634,2.269
solving this.,1137.903,0.701
And I think in many cases there are some issues that,1138.604,2.168
can be resolved that will help them do their job,1140.772,2.737
better to keep the people of Chicago safer.,1143.509,2.335
And what he wants to do is provide the resources of,1145.844,3.037
the federal government and it can span a bunch of,1148.881,1.835
things.,1150.716,0.667
There&amp;#39;s no one thing it can be -- you know there,1151.383,2.269
"can be aid, there can be if was requested up",1153.652,2.502
"through the governor, through the proper",1156.154,1.502
"channels, that the federal government can provide on",1157.656,2.035
a law enforcement basis.,1159.691,1.368
But there&amp;#39;s other aid that can be extended as well,1161.059,2.136
either through the U.S.,1163.195,0.801
Attorney&amp;#39;s Office or other means that will ensure,1163.996,2.869
that the people of Chicago,1166.865,1.635
have the resources to feel safe.,1168.5,1.735
That&amp;#39;s what he means Lynn.,1170.235,1.268
"And part of it is that no American, whether or not",1171.503,2.903
you live in Chicago or Nebraska shouldn&amp;#39;t feel,1174.406,2.836
like you can walk down the streets of a city or the,1177.242,3.704
streets of a city in this country and fear,1180.946,2.269
for your life.,1183.215,1.268
And I think too often that&amp;#39;s happening,1184.483,1.001
in Chicago.,1185.484,1.101
The Press: What will happen next just so we,1186.585,1.268
know the time table?,1187.853,1.001
Mr. Spicer: I think next is we&amp;#39;ll get hopefully get,1188.854,3.336
a dialog started with Mayor Emanuel.,1192.19,2.136
Try to figure out what a path forward can be so,1194.326,2.769
that we get -- we come up with a plan that can keep,1197.095,3.204
the people of Chicago safe and help ease the,1200.299,2.969
problem there. Yes.,1203.268,3.47
The Press: Did Mexico&amp;#39;s government have any,1206.738,1.068
knowledge that this new executive order would be,1207.806,1.802
signed today?,1209.608,1.501
And do you feel President Trump and President Pena,1211.109,2.102
Nieto will be on the same page after they meet next,1213.211,2.703
week in terms of who is paying for the wall?,1215.914,2.369
Mr. Spicer: I hope so.,1218.283,1.402
I think that they&amp;#39;re definitely going to,1219.685,1.301
discuss not only NAFTA but the wall.,1220.986,1.868
There&amp;#39;s a lot of stuff that are going to come up.,1222.854,1.335
We&amp;#39;ve got a lot of trade that goes between the two,1224.189,1.668
"countries, there&amp;#39;s some security -- obviously,",1225.857,2.403
homeland security issues but there&amp;#39;s no question I,1228.26,1.935
think that NAFTA is going to be big on that list and,1230.195,2.136
trade overall.,1232.331,0.734
But and with respect to your first question I,1234.633,2.636
don&amp;#39;t think we generally telegraph to people who,1237.269,3.236
are coming to visit what executive orders were,1240.505,1.435
going to send. Kristen.,1241.94,1.735
"The Press: Sean, thank you.",1243.675,1.201
A couple of questions.,1244.876,1.035
I want to go back to that draft executive order that,1245.911,2.436
would undo some of the restrictions,1248.347,1.534
for detainees.,1249.881,1.302
Has the President seen that draft EO?,1251.183,3.103
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sorry the one that he&amp;#39;s signing?,1254.286,1.101
The Press: Has he seen it?,1255.387,0.767
"No, no the draft executive order that would undo the",1256.154,3.337
restrictions on how to handle detainees.,1259.491,2.336
Mr. Spicer: I guess I&amp;#39;m having a hard time you&amp;#39;re,1261.827,2.702
asking me if a document that&amp;#39;s not a White House,1264.529,2.369
document he&amp;#39;s seen.,1266.898,1.535
I don&amp;#39;t believe to the best of my knowledge and,1268.433,1.235
so I would ask -- this is the second day in a row,1269.668,4.004
we&amp;#39;re getting asked about documents that are,1273.672,1.935
floating around and people saying -- and frankly,1275.607,2.87
reports being published attributing documents to,1278.477,3.603
the White House that are not White House documents.,1282.08,1.602
The Press: Sean I haven&amp;#39;t attributed --,1283.682,0.801
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, I&amp;#39;m not saying you.",1284.75,0.567
The Press: I&amp;#39;m asking do you know if he&amp;#39;s seen it?,1285.617,1.268
Mr. Spicer: To the best of my knowledge he,1287.285,0.935
hasn&amp;#39;t seen it.,1288.487,0.6
I think he&amp;#39;s got a lot of other things --,1289.087,0.901
The Press: Since it is floating around Sean --,1290.222,1.468
"Mr. Spicer: You get one more, let&amp;#39;s not be greedy.",1291.99,2.336
The Press: I have two more.,1294.593,0.867
Since it is floating around --,1295.761,0.901
Mr. Spicer: Okay.,1296.928,1.135
The Press: -- is he considering --,1298.063,0.233
Mr. Spicer: Kristin don&amp;#39;t this is a --,1298.697,0.4
The Press: -- black sites and other orders --,1299.331,2.269
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to start answering,1301.833,1.168
hypothetical about documents that are,1303.235,0.767
floating around.,1304.002,0.901
You&amp;#39;re basically --,1304.903,0.434
The Press: -- is he considering --,1305.337,1.034
"Mr. Spicer: Okay, Kristen we&amp;#39;re going to end",1306.605,0.767
this right now.,1307.639,0.434
"Hunter, Hunter, no, Hunter Walker thank you. Hunter.",1308.073,2.302
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",1310.642,0.601
The President is reportedly going to limit,1311.51,2.169
access to the country for visa holders and refugees,1313.679,2.569
"from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan,",1316.248,1.802
"Syria, and Yemen.",1318.05,1.801
Will he be taking any steps that will affect,1319.851,1.902
people from those countries who,1321.753,1.135
are already here?,1322.888,1.401
Including perhaps registering them or,1324.289,1.702
beginning deportations?,1325.991,1.268
Mr. Spicer: I think we&amp;#39;re going to have something --,1327.259,0.934
I mean look the President has talked extensively,1328.193,1.635
"about extreme vetting, today and you&amp;#39;ll see more",1330.062,3.77
action this week on keeping America safe.,1334.166,1.034
This has been something he&amp;#39;s talked about in the,1335.6,1.001
"inaugural address, he talked about",1336.835,0.934
in the campaign.,1337.769,1.435
As we get into that implementation of that,1339.204,1.635
executive order we&amp;#39;ll have further details.,1340.839,2.102
But I think the guiding principal for the,1342.941,1.502
President is keeping this country safe and allowing,1344.443,2.302
people who are from a country that has a,1346.745,3.103
propensity to do us harm.,1349.848,2.436
To make sure that we take the necessary steps to,1352.284,2.169
ensure that the people who come to this country,1354.453,1.668
especially where areas that have a predisposition,1356.121,4.938
if you will or a higher degree of concern.,1361.059,4.271
That we take the appropriate steps to make,1365.33,1.301
sure that they&amp;#39;re coming to this country for all,1366.631,1.869
the right reasons.,1368.5,1.068
And I think we&amp;#39;ll have further and further,1369.568,1.168
information on that fact later this week.,1370.736,2.235
The Press: What about the fraud investigation?,1372.971,2.069
What&amp;#39;s the ultimate goal here?,1375.04,1.702
And essentially isn&amp;#39;t the President questioning the,1376.742,2.569
legitimacy of his own election?,1379.311,1.635
"Mr. Spicer: No, I think that the question -- look",1380.946,2.536
voting is the most sacred right that we,1383.482,1.568
have as Americans.,1385.05,1.702
This is what is the hallmark and the,1386.752,1.701
foundation of our democracy.,1388.453,2.136
And to ensure that we know that every person&amp;#39;s vote,1390.589,2.702
counts equally as the next citizen is probably one of,1393.592,3.637
the greatest things that we can do.,1397.496,1.668
The Press: But aren&amp;#39;t those checks and balances,1399.164,0.968
already in place?,1400.132,1.201
Mr. Spicer: I -- part of the reason we need to do a,1401.333,1.868
study is to make sure.,1403.201,0.701
Look there&amp;#39;s -- I don&amp;#39;t want to start throwing out,1403.902,2.736
"numbers, but there&amp;#39;s a lot of people that are dead",1406.638,2.136
"that are on roles, there are people that are voting",1408.774,1.968
"in two places, or that on",1410.742,3.27
the roles in two different states.,1414.012,0.567
Sometimes in three different states.,1414.579,1.135
I think taking the necessary steps to study,1415.714,1.435
and to track what we can do to both understand the,1418.95,3.07
scope of the problem and then secondly how to stop,1422.02,3.337
the problem going forward is something that is very,1425.357,2.269
clearly in the best interest.,1427.626,1.067
John Gizzi.,1428.693,1.302
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",1429.995,2.235
Two brief questions.,1432.23,1.168
"First, Congressman Todd Rokita, from the Vice",1433.398,2.669
"President&amp;#39;s home state of Indiana, himself a former",1436.067,3.27
"Secretary of State, is the father of that state&amp;#39;s",1439.337,3.537
voter ID law which went to the Supreme Court.,1442.874,3.57
He has long advocated other states following the,1446.444,2.87
Indiana example all states adopting voter ID.,1449.314,4.137
Mr. Spicer: Right.,1453.451,0.468
The Press: Is that something the President,1453.919,1.101
would get behind to achieve?,1455.02,2.602
Mr. Spicer: I think the President&amp;#39;s number one,1457.622,1.302
goal is to make sure that we -- I mean Georgia is,1458.924,2.102
another great example of a state that implemented a,1461.026,2.435
very successful voter ID program.,1463.461,4.739
And I think that&amp;#39;s what the President&amp;#39;s -- you,1468.2,1.635
know one of several things.,1469.835,0.867
"But, lets -- the first step is for him to get",1470.702,2.669
this you know I don&amp;#39;t want to call it a task force,1473.371,4.038
yet because it&amp;#39;s not there yet.,1477.409,1.468
But this effort underway that can look at the scope,1478.877,2.736
of the problem and then John maybe make,1481.613,2.069
some recommendations.,1483.682,1.001
And maybe it is voter ID in states.,1484.683,2.169
"But right now, we&amp;#39;ve got 50 states and the",1486.852,1.801
territories that all have various different ID&amp;#39;s and,1488.653,3.537
I know that there&amp;#39;s some,1492.19,0.801
compliance issues to make sure.,1492.991,1.235
But part of that is to figure out the extent,1494.226,3.403
of the problem.,1497.629,1.235
"In some states, what it takes to get a driver&amp;#39;s",1498.864,2.168
license might be an issue and I&amp;#39;m just -- but I,1501.032,2.503
think we have to understand where the,1503.535,1.702
"problem exists, how deep it goes, and then suggest",1505.237,3.87
some remedies to it.,1509.107,1.135
"But right now, to sort of pre-judge the process",1510.242,2.369
would sort of get in front of the whole,1512.611,1.334
need to have it.,1513.945,0.734
Paul Bernard.,1514.679,0.601
The Press: I have a second question.,1515.28,1.969
Next week is the National Prayer Breakfast --,1517.249,1.801
Mr. Spicer: It is.,1519.05,0.434
The Press: -- Sean.,1519.484,0.768
And Presidents from Eisenhower to President,1520.252,2.702
Obama spoke about their faith.,1522.954,2.803
Will the President attend?,1525.757,1.502
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m going to have to get back to you.,1527.259,1.134
I&amp;#39;d be glad to check on that I just don&amp;#39;t have the,1528.393,2.169
President&amp;#39;s schedule for the next week.,1530.562,1.435
"So, I will get -- hold on a second, Paul Bernard.",1531.997,3.036
The Press: Sean what will the White House presence,1535.033,5.472
do on immigration to sanctuary cites and,1540.505,2.87
sanctuary counties that say go ahead keep your,1543.375,2.135
"money, we don&amp;#39;t care.",1545.51,0.934
We&amp;#39;re going to harbor these illegal criminals.,1546.444,3.571
"And also, what do you do about countries that",1550.015,2.769
"pretty much say the same thing, who won&amp;#39;t allow",1552.784,1.668
those people to come back into their country?,1554.452,2.703
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think the first step Paul is the",1557.155,2.169
funding piece.,1559.324,0.867
"And again, this is a mulit-step problem.",1560.191,2.103
And that&amp;#39;s why you&amp;#39;ve started to see different,1562.294,1.468
executive orders get rolled out and there&amp;#39;s you,1563.762,1.701
know a Congressional piece that we have,1565.463,1.936
to do legislatively.,1567.399,1.268
But to the extent of the President can continue to,1568.667,1.901
identify areas that he can handle with an executive,1570.568,2.87
actions and orders and memorandums to start,1573.438,4.538
curbing the problem of illegal immigration.,1577.976,3.637
But also again it&amp;#39;s about -- we talked a little bit,1581.613,3.136
"about it yesterday in terms of funding, there&amp;#39;s",1584.749,1.235
a tax payer issue here.,1585.984,1.601
You know you&amp;#39;ve got the American people out there,1587.585,1.736
working and then having their money sent to places,1589.321,2.936
where folks that aren&amp;#39;t in this country legally are,1592.257,2.669
getting sent to cities that are therefore using,1594.926,2.202
their tax dollars.,1597.128,0.868
That&amp;#39;s a part of it.,1597.996,1.101
"So, it&amp;#39;s not a one-step solution I think that&amp;#39;s",1599.097,2.169
"why you&amp;#39;ve got the wall, you&amp;#39;ve got some funding",1601.266,1.902
"issues, you&amp;#39;ve got the vetting, but it is not a",1603.168,3.637
one step process.,1606.805,1.735
"It&amp;#39;s going to be a multi-tier,",1608.54,1.001
multi-step problem. Yeah.,1609.541,2.669
"The Press: Sean, on the Supreme Court, what is the",1612.21,4.571
President&amp;#39;s use of Judge Gorsuch?,1616.781,2.937
He&amp;#39;s a name that&amp;#39;s been circulated.,1619.718,1.901
And then more broadly does the President feel like,1621.619,3.437
the choice should be someone who is in their,1625.056,2.169
"late 40&amp;#39;s, early 50&amp;#39;s as a way of leaving his",1627.225,2.903
imprint on the Court?,1630.128,1.435
Mr. Spicer: I think that there have been several,1631.563,1.201
names that have been floated out there.,1632.764,3.136
He put out the list a while ago of 20 or so.,1635.9,3.003
That&amp;#39;s where I would look.,1638.903,1.001
I&amp;#39;m definitely not getting ahead of,1639.904,2.269
the President on this.,1642.173,1.969
But I would suggest to you that the people that are,1644.142,1.768
on that list that he put out during the campaign,1645.91,2.636
represent the kind of people that he&amp;#39;s not just,1648.546,2.536
going to nominate for the Supreme Court but we have,1651.082,3.137
"well over a 100, I think it&amp;#39;s a 103 vacancies at",1654.219,3.603
the federal level and at the appellate level.,1657.822,2.803
And I think that&amp;#39;s going,1660.625,0.968
to continue to guide him. Margaret.,1661.593,1.868
"The Press: Sean, one point of personal privilege can",1663.461,2.269
we get the text of the executive orders when the,1665.73,2.169
President makes the announcement?,1667.899,1.502
Mr. Spicer: Yes.,1669.401,0.467
The Press: That would help.,1669.868,0.6
Mr. Spicer: I will tell you this Margaret I was,1670.468,1.669
just told the President is about to speak.,1672.137,2.068
I will get back you the executive orders ASAP.,1674.205,1.802
Thank you guys very much.,1676.007,1.735
"Real quick -- hold on, hold on, guys,",1677.742,0.968
guys hold on.,1678.71,2.035
Just for guidance purposes we will be gaggling,1680.745,5.306
tomorrow on Air Force I.,1686.051,1.601
Thank you very much we look forward to seeing you,1687.652,1.301
in Philadelphia.,1688.953,1.402
Bye guys.,1690.355,0.567
