Mr. Spicer: Welcome back. Great to see everybody.,5.238,1.568
Thank you all for coming.,6.806,1.735
It&amp;#39;s good to see the interest is still there.,8.541,2.97
I want to start off by noting the President got off,11.511,5.138
the phone just a short time ago with Canadian Prime,16.649,2.903
Minister Trudeau to discuss the vicious attack on a,19.552,3.003
Quebec City mosque last night.,22.555,2.236
The President offered his condolence as well as his,24.791,2.369
thoughts and prayers to the victims and their family and,27.16,2.736
to all Canadians.,29.896,1.568
This is another senseless act of violence that cannot,31.464,3.27
be tolerated.,34.734,1.301
The President also pledged to support the Canadian,36.035,2.236
police and intelligence service in any way necessary.,38.271,3.504
"Prime Minster Trudeau was extremely appreciative, and",41.775,2.502
he was also cautious to draw conclusions on the motives,44.277,2.436
"at this stage of the investigation, and the",46.713,2.002
President shared those thoughts.,48.715,1.968
Canadian law enforcement officials are actively,50.683,2.002
investigating this matter.,52.685,1.569
We condemn this attack in the strongest possible terms.,54.254,4.004
"It&amp;#39;s a terrible reminder of why we must remain vigilant,",58.258,3.57
and why the President is taking steps to be proactive,61.828,3.203
rather than reactive when it comes to our nation&amp;#39;s safety,65.031,3.237
and security.,68.268,1.801
"We&amp;#39;re, of course, praying for those injured in the",70.069,1.702
attack and are keeping in close contact with officials,71.771,2.803
in Quebec and Canada.,74.574,1.935
We&amp;#39;re moving into a quick recap of the events of the,76.509,4.772
past few days.,81.281,1.134
"As you all know, the President had an extremely",82.415,1.802
busy weekend.,84.217,1.268
He followed up on a week of -- his first week of action,85.485,2.502
with a weekend of action.,87.987,1.669
"On Saturday and Sunday alone, the President spoke",89.656,2.135
with eight foreign leaders.,91.791,1.869
He signed executive orders delivering on some of the,93.66,1.968
biggest campaign promises that he made to the,95.628,1.802
American people.,97.43,0.801
And he met with staff to continue to plan,98.231,2.202
another busy week.,100.433,1.535
"Also, over this weekend, we carried out a very",101.968,1.969
successful raid against Al Qaeda in the Arabian,103.937,2.536
"peninsula, which resulted in the death of an estimated 14",106.473,3.436
AQAP members and the capture of important intelligence,109.909,3.804
that will better enable us to counter and prevent,113.713,2.77
future terrorist plots.,116.483,2.335
"Tragically, during this raid, the life of a brave",118.818,4.471
service member was taken and four were wounded.,123.289,3.504
Our thoughts and our prayers are with the family of this,126.793,2.836
"fallen American hero, and we also pray for a speedy",129.629,3.003
recovery and complete recovery of those,132.632,2.636
service members who sustained injuries.,135.268,2.836
"As a quick recap, on Friday you saw the President&amp;#39;s",138.104,3.036
enthusiastic reception at the Department of Defense,141.14,3.204
for the ceremonial swearing in of Secretary Mattis as,144.344,2.702
our Secretary of Defense.,147.046,2.069
"While at the Pentagon, the President also signed two",149.115,2.002
executive actions to protect America from those,151.117,2.77
who wish to do us harm.,153.887,2.035
This focus on securing our borders in our homeland was,155.922,3.136
obviously a major part of what the President,159.058,1.635
"campaigned on, and now he&amp;#39;s doing exactly what the --",160.693,3.07
he&amp;#39;s doing exactly what he told the American people,163.763,3.203
he would do.,166.966,1.368
The President will always put the safety and,168.334,1.802
prosperity of our country first and foremost.,170.136,3.303
We kicked off Saturday by launching the weekly,173.439,2.103
"address, which debuted for the first time on Facebook Live.",175.542,3.77
Nearly 11 million people were reached by the,179.312,2.202
address online.,181.514,1.502
Over 1.1 million people engaged with the post via,183.016,3.47
"comments, likes, and other interactions.",186.486,2.335
"And as of this morning, the video had been viewed almost",188.821,2.536
5 million times.,191.357,1.769
"And just as he did throughout the campaign,",193.126,1.701
this is another example of the President being able to,194.827,2.136
take his message directly to the American people.,196.963,2.803
"On Saturday, the President signed three executive",199.766,2.169
actions on issues ranging from government ethics to,201.935,2.769
national security.,204.704,1.835
As part of the President&amp;#39;s plan to drain the swamp in,206.539,2.536
"Washington and return power to the American people, he",209.075,3.504
signed an executive order imposing strict,212.579,2.969
post-employment rules on all federal political appointees,215.548,3.237
including a five-year lobbying ban and a lifetime,218.785,2.969
ban for foreign government lobbying among,221.754,2.403
other restrictions.,224.157,1.301
"The President continues to make it very, very clear",225.458,2.202
that if you want to be part of a Trump administration,227.66,2.503
"you&amp;#39;re going to be putting -- serving the country,",230.163,2.235
not yourself.,232.398,1.535
The President also signed a memorandum modernizing the,233.933,2.469
structure of the National Security Council and the,236.402,2.236
Homeland Security Council.,238.638,1.802
There&amp;#39;s been a lot of misreporting this week about,240.44,2.769
what this memo does and does not do.,243.209,2.436
"So, let me walk you through this real quick.",245.645,2.169
There&amp;#39;s two issues at hand.,247.814,1.168
"One is the make-up of the NSC, and the other is the",248.982,2.769
make-up of the Principals Committee.,251.751,2.002
The Principal Committee is merely the NSC minus the,253.753,3.17
President.,256.923,2.936
The idea that the chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,259.859,3.003
and the DNA are being downgraded or removed is,262.862,2.369
utter nonsense.,265.231,1.201
They are at every NSC meeting and are welcome to,266.432,3.37
attend the Principals meetings as well.,269.802,1.969
"To be clear, the memo lays out that if there&amp;#39;s a",271.771,1.802
"Principals meeting that is outside their scope, for",273.573,2.836
"example, a Homeland -- a domestic issue that doesn&amp;#39;t",276.409,2.736
"pertain to the military, they&amp;#39;re not required but",279.145,2.603
certainly welcome to be in attendance.,281.748,2.102
We recognize that certain Homeland Security issues may,283.85,3.103
"not be military issues, and it would not be in the best",286.953,2.602
interest of the Joint Chiefs&amp;#39; valuable time to be,289.555,3.204
at these meetings.,292.759,1.334
"Just yesterday, we called several outlets who were",294.093,2.036
severely misreporting this topic to better inform them,296.129,3.069
about what this memo means.,299.198,2.102
Let me just walk through this real quick.,301.3,2.236
This is the 2001 NSC stand-up memo.,303.536,4.505
This is the 2009 memo.,308.041,4.037
And then this one is the -- I&amp;#39;ve got the &amp;#39;13 here as,312.078,3.737
"well, or the 2017, rather, right here.",315.815,3.136
This is the language that is in -- the language that,318.951,2.47
"consists of the National Security team, the director",321.421,3.503
"of the Central Intelligence, and the chairmen of the",324.924,2.503
"Joint Chiefs of Staff, as statutory advisors to the",327.427,2.569
"NSC, shall also attend NSC meetings.",329.996,3.07
That is the identical language in 2017 as it was,333.066,4.437
in 2009 when Obama drafted his.,337.503,2.069
"Verbatim, identical.",339.572,2.302
The make-up of the Principals Committee from,341.874,2.036
2017 is exactly as it was in both 2017 as it was in 2001.,343.91,7.274
One-hundred percent identical except we add the,351.184,1.768
word &amp;quot;also.&amp;quot; I think it&amp;#39;s pretty clear that if you,352.952,3.504
"look at all three of these, that&amp;#39;s what it does.",356.456,4.537
"To be clear, the memo -- just yesterday we called",360.993,2.937
"that out, starting with the membership of the NSC.",363.93,2.636
"As you can see here, the language that&amp;#39;s part of the",366.566,2.035
President&amp;#39;s memo is identical to the language,368.601,2.569
from President&amp;#39;s Bush&amp;#39;s 2001.,371.17,2.336
The only thing that&amp;#39;s changed in this is the,373.506,2.502
addition of the director of National Intelligence as a,376.008,2.837
position that didn&amp;#39;t exist in 2001.,378.845,2.535
"For what it&amp;#39;s worth, it&amp;#39;s the same as Obama&amp;#39;s, save",381.38,3.204
for the word &amp;quot;also.&amp;quot; In terms of the Principals,384.584,2.669
"Committee, as you can see from the various language",387.253,3.77
"here, and this is -- I&amp;#39;ll give you 2017 on the",391.023,2.403
Principals Committee -- this is the Principals Committee,393.426,3.67
in 2017 and this is the 2001 Principals Committee.,397.096,5.439
It is literally 100 percent the same.,402.535,5.539
2001 and 2017 are identical.,408.074,5.439
"So, this idea that there&amp;#39;s been a change or a downgrade",413.513,2.402
is utter nonsense.,415.915,1.969
"With respect to the Joint Chiefs in particular, the",419.352,2.402
President holds Chairman Dunford in the highest regard.,421.754,2.736
The suggestion that he would downgrade the important role,424.891,2.769
that the chairman plays in matters of national security,427.66,3.27
reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of the,430.93,2.369
tremendous respect that the President holds for both the,433.299,2.636
chairman himself and the Joint Chiefs as a whole.,435.935,3.77
"For the record, I know someone tweeted out, &amp;quot;Where",439.705,2.837
was the CIA in this?&amp;quot;,442.542,2.035
The CIA hasn&amp;#39;t been part of the NSC since the DNI was,444.577,3.937
sworn in for the first time in 2005.,448.514,2.836
"That being said, the President has such respect",451.35,2.67
for Director Pompeo and the men and women of the CIA,454.02,2.869
that today the President is announcing that he will,456.889,2.269
amend the memo to add the CIA back into the NSC.,459.158,4.705
"So, I know that there was a tweet yesterday from the",463.863,3.37
"former national security advisor that said, &amp;quot;Where is",467.233,5.339
the CIA out of everything?&amp;quot;,472.572,1.534
"Well, I&amp;#39;d like to remind the former national security",474.106,2.703
"advisor that when the memo was drafted in 2009, I don&amp;#39;t",476.809,3.937
see the Obama administration including the CIA in theirs.,480.746,2.57
"It is President Trump that is including the CIA, not",483.316,4.004
the former administration.,487.32,1.835
"So just to be clear, when it comes to the CIA, as you",489.155,5.706
"know, number one, it wasn&amp;#39;t part of the restructuring of",494.861,3.103
"the NSC after the DNI was named and sworn in in 2005,",497.964,5.071
and we are the administration that&amp;#39;s adding,503.035,1.702
it back in to the NSC and amending it in.,504.737,2.202
It was the Obama administration that didn&amp;#39;t,506.939,1.969
have it in.,508.908,0.667
"So, to answer the former national security advisor&amp;#39;s",509.575,3.904
"tweet, the CIA is in ours and it wasn&amp;#39;t in theirs.",513.479,5.806
With respect to over -- hold on one second.,519.285,5.539
"Moving on, the President also signed another memo",524.824,2.569
when he was at the Department of Defense,527.393,1.301
instructing the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the next 30 days,528.694,2.836
to deliver to him a plan to defeat ISIS.,531.53,2.703
This comprehensive strategy and plan must include a,534.233,3.137
recommendation to changes to any rules of engagement and,537.37,2.836
other police restrictions that exceed the requirements,540.206,3.27
of international law regarding the use of ISIS;,543.476,2.969
"public diplomacy, information, operations, and",546.445,2.97
cyber strategies to isolate and delegitimize ISIS and,549.415,3.27
its radical Islamist ideology; identification of,552.685,3.203
new coalition partners in the fight against ISIS and,555.888,2.669
policies to empower coalition partners to fight,558.557,2.336
ISIS and its affiliates; mechanisms to cut off ISIS,560.893,3.47
"financial support, including financial transfers, money",564.363,3.337
"laundering, oil revenue, human trafficking, the sales",567.7,3.203
"of looted art, historical facts, and other revenue",570.903,2.102
sources; and a detailed strategy to robustly,573.005,2.77
fund the plan.,575.775,1.201
This presidential memorandum is a profound statement that,576.976,2.936
the President&amp;#39;s clear objective is to defeat and,579.912,2.269
"destroy ISIS, and that we are going to do it",582.181,2.102
systematically.,584.283,1.301
This is not only a necessary step for America&amp;#39;s national,585.584,2.336
"security, it is also a humanitarian imperative.",587.92,2.97
"If ISIS is left in power, the threat it poses only grows.",590.89,5.405
We know it has attempted to develop chemical weapons,596.295,2.336
capabilities; it maintains the goal of recruiting,598.631,2.736
homegrown terrorists and its attacks against our allies,601.367,2.869
and partners continue to mount.,604.236,1.202
The United States must take decisive action.,605.438,3.837
And the President is taking the necessary steps.,609.275,3.336
"Over the weekend, the President also held",612.611,1.702
constructive phone calls with the heads of government,614.313,2.302
"from Australia, France, Germany, Japan, Russia,",616.615,4.271
"Saudi Arabia, South Korea and the United Arab Emirates.",620.886,3.804
"During the calls, the President reaffirmed our",624.69,2.77
partnerships and discussed strengthening our mutual,627.46,2.269
defenses in interests throughout the world.,629.729,3.069
The safety of the American people and the security of,632.798,2.102
American homeland continue to be the President&amp;#39;s,634.9,2.77
top priority.,637.67,1.234
His outreach to these leaders is a critical step,638.904,2.603
in turning the page of the failed foreign policies of,641.507,2.736
the past eight years.,644.243,2.302
"Notably, he did all this in the face of extreme",646.545,1.969
obstructionism from Democrats in the Senate who,648.514,2.536
are holding up 17 of its department or agency leads,651.05,3.637
that require Senate confirmation.,654.687,1.968
"In contrast, 10 days into his term, President Obama",656.655,2.937
had -- only had seven in these positions awaiting,659.592,2.436
confirmation.,662.028,1.101
President Bush had all but four confirmed.,663.129,2.802
If Senate Democrats think that voters are going to be,665.931,2.103
"okay with them continuing business as usual, dragging",668.034,2.936
their heels and confirm -- confirming qualified,670.97,1.935
"nominees, they sorely misunderstood the message",672.905,3.303
this November.,676.208,1.468
"The truth is, these cabinet members are unbelievably",677.676,2.737
qualified and will all be confirmed by the Senate.,680.413,3.136
And Democrats know this.,683.549,1.735
"So, it&amp;#39;s time to stop playing political games with",685.284,2.102
the core functions of our government.,687.386,2.369
"This morning, the Office of the U.S.",689.755,1.368
Trade Representative sent 12 letters officially notifying,691.123,3.304
the nations to the Trans-Pacific Partnership,694.427,2.402
that the U.S.,696.829,0.667
"has withdrawn from the agreement, the next step in",697.496,2.57
fulfilling the President&amp;#39;s campaign promise to get our,700.066,2.569
country out of unacceptable trade deals that don&amp;#39;t put,702.635,2.969
America&amp;#39;s interests first.,705.604,2.036
"The President will continue to negotiate new, better",707.64,2.936
"trade agreements that wills bring jobs back, increased",710.576,2.269
American wages and reduce our trade deficit.,712.845,3.303
The White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs,716.148,2.269
has been hard at work making sure that all lines of,718.417,2.036
communication are open at all levels of government,720.453,2.636
throughout the country.,723.089,1.601
"As of today, the White House has made contact with all",724.69,2.836
governors&amp;#39; office in every state and territory and,727.526,3.103
deeper dive conversations on a range of issues has,730.629,2.269
already taken place with 32 governors or their offices.,732.898,3.971
Outreach efforts have touched 22 of 50 state,736.869,2.936
attorney generals; 32 of 50 states secretaries of state;,739.805,3.937
16 speakers of the house; the leaders of the 10,743.742,2.87
"largest federally recognized tribes; and, the leaders of",746.612,2.87
some of the country&amp;#39;s largest counties and,749.482,2.636
municipalities all have expressed enthusiasm about,752.118,3.169
working with the White House on issues impacting their,755.287,2.269
local communities and families.,757.556,2.202
The Inter-Governmental Affairs Office is also,759.758,2.103
preparing the National -- it&amp;#39;s preparing for the,761.861,1.835
National Governors&amp;#39; Association meeting in,763.696,2.269
"Washington at the end of February, at which the",765.965,1.902
President plans to host a dinner.,767.867,2.068
"Today, the President started his day with a -- with a",769.935,2.77
breakfast and listening session with small business,772.705,2.436
leaders; a list of attendees is available,775.141,2.235
if you&amp;#39;re interested.,777.376,1.168
The meeting comes on the heels of similar listening,778.544,1.935
sessions that the President held last week with some of,780.479,2.336
the country&amp;#39;s top business and union leaders and,782.815,2.602
frontline workers.,785.417,1.368
He&amp;#39;s made it clear in his first week in office through,786.785,2.603
"numerous executive actions, meetings and listening",789.388,2.936
"sessions, that he&amp;#39;s fully committed to fighting on",792.324,2.403
behalf of American workers and small businesses.,794.727,3.236
"This morning, the Vice President hosted a breakfast",797.963,3.337
with King Abdullah II of Jordan at the Naval,801.3,2.703
Observatory and the President expects to greet,804.003,2.502
the King this Thursday at the National Prayer Breakfast.,806.505,3.337
The Vice President thanked the King for his efforts in,809.842,2.803
advance -- in advancing peace and stability in the,812.645,2.068
Middle East and reaffirmed the United States&amp;#39;,814.713,2.369
commitment to Jordan security and economic,817.082,2.103
development.,819.185,1.101
"The two leaders discussed events in the region,",820.286,1.768
including ways to accelerate the coalition&amp;#39;s efforts to,822.054,2.369
defeat ISIS and promote a political solution to the,824.423,2.836
Syrian conflict.,827.259,1.769
The Vice President welcomes the King&amp;#39;s views on,829.028,2.068
potential changes involving the U.S.,831.096,1.936
Embassy in Israel and reiterated that the United,833.032,2.068
States is at the early stages of this,835.1,2.236
decision-making process.,837.336,1.835
The two leaders also discussed how to best make,839.171,1.835
progress towards a comprehensive agreement,841.006,2.102
between Israel and the Palestinians.,843.108,2.269
The Vice President and King Abdullah agreed on the,845.377,1.869
importance of continuing to strengthen the U.S.,847.246,1.835
- Jordan relationship and pledged to stay in close,849.081,2.436
contact about events in the region.,851.517,2.269
"Also, this morning, the President signed an",854.32,1.568
Executive Order reducing regulation and controlling,855.888,3.036
regulatory costs.,858.924,1.602
The order instructs the Director of Office and,860.526,2.035
Management Budget to issue guidelines that for every,862.561,2.736
"one new regulation, two existing regulations in an",865.297,3.804
agency be eliminated.,869.101,2.202
We&amp;#39;re calling in One In - Two Out.,871.303,1.969
"Additionally, the order states that the cost of all",873.272,2.102
new regulations finalized in fiscal 2017 must be no,875.374,4.171
greater than zero for each agency.,879.545,2.602
"And beginning in 2018, each agency will have an",882.147,2.503
"incremental cost cap set by the director of OMB, beyond",884.65,3.804
which it cannot issue regulations.,888.454,1.802
This Executive Order is the first step in the President,890.789,3.137
delivering on his promise to slash bureaucratic red tape,893.926,3.236
that is choking our nation&amp;#39;s small businesses.,897.162,2.636
"Under the President&amp;#39;s leadership, the federal",899.798,1.802
government will no longer punish Americans for working,901.6,2.603
and doing business in the United States.,904.203,2.202
"Every year, over regulation cost our economy billions of",906.405,3.837
dollars and reduces the wealth of every,910.242,2.469
American household.,912.711,1.635
This Executive Order will help get the economy back on,914.346,2.336
track and is part of the President&amp;#39;s bold plan to,916.682,2.836
create 25 million new American jobs in the next,919.518,4.037
decade.,923.555,1.168
It&amp;#39;s worth noting that this order is perhaps the most,924.723,2.703
significant administration action in the world of,927.426,2.903
regulatory reform since President Reagan created the,930.329,2.736
Office of Information Regulatory Affairs in 1981.,933.065,3.737
"Finally, a few administrative notes -- I&amp;#39;m",937.469,2.403
pleased to announce that Prime Minister Netanyahu of,939.872,2.068
Israel will visit the United States on February 15th.,941.94,3.738
Our relationship with the only democracy in the Middle,945.678,2.168
East is crucial to the security of both our nations,947.846,2.703
and the President looks forward to discussing,950.549,1.668
"continuously strategic, technological, military and",952.217,3.337
intelligence cooperation with the Prime Minister.,955.554,2.936
"As you know, tomorrow at 8:00 p.m.",958.49,1.468
the President will announce who he intends to nominate,959.958,1.902
for the Supreme Court and for a party preaching,961.86,3.571
"tolerance, it&amp;#39;s interesting to see some Democrats have",965.431,2.402
already come out against this unnamed individual.,967.833,3.704
"So, with that, I&amp;#39;d be glad to take a few questions.",971.537,2.135
The Press: Sean?,974.173,0.834
Mr. Spicer: Yeah.,975.541,0.7
"The Press: Sean, over the weekend, President Trump",976.942,0.968
requested that the King of Saudi Arabia join him by,977.91,1.568
supporting safe zones in Syria.,979.478,1.301
Mr. Spicer: Right.,980.779,0.501
The Press: What type of support does President Trump,981.914,1.001
intend to provide and when can Syrians expect to,982.915,3.036
receive this support?,985.951,0.901
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think it came up in several of his",986.852,2.135
calls and that&amp;#39;s an important note.,988.987,1.569
There is such strong agreement with how we,990.556,4.538
address this problem and you&amp;#39;re seeing it from,995.094,1.801
across the spectrum.,996.895,2.036
It&amp;#39;s an important that we have stability in the region,998.931,2.102
and I think the idea that this was an area of mutual,1001.033,3.036
discussion and agreement is important when we talk about,1004.069,3.704
stability in the region.,1007.773,0.867
"And so, we&amp;#39;ll have continued discussions on it, but I",1008.64,2.136
think that first step of getting both sides on the,1010.776,2.269
first page was a huge step forward.,1013.045,2.969
Blake.,1016.014,0.901
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1017.549,0.868
The President said today in that on-camera session with,1018.417,2.536
the business leaders about how tough -- about how the,1020.953,1.802
market has run from -- during his last,1022.755,3.737
couple of months.,1026.492,0.7
I want to ask you a question related to that.,1027.192,2.102
"Today, coincidentally, happens to be the biggest",1029.294,2.236
market drop since October and one of the uncertainties,1031.53,3.57
for investors is that tax reform might not get,1035.1,3.07
done this year.,1038.17,1.535
"So my question to you is, can the Administration",1039.705,2.869
commit to major tax reform in 2017?,1042.574,1.702
"Mr. Spicer: Well, that&amp;#39;s a two-way street and I think",1045.444,1.868
that you&amp;#39;ve seen a commitment from the,1047.312,1.902
President to fight on behalf of small businesses.,1049.214,1.869
That&amp;#39;s what this regulation thing was today.,1051.083,1.668
"I mean, it really can&amp;#39;t underscore how important it is.",1052.751,2.903
"Since 1981, we haven&amp;#39;t seen anything of this magnitude",1055.654,2.97
to address the regulation -- the regulatory impact that,1058.624,4.471
small businesses face.,1063.095,1.501
We&amp;#39;re going to continue to work with both houses of,1064.596,2.069
"Congress, both the Senate Finance Committee and the",1066.665,1.735
House Ways and Means Committee to develop a,1068.4,1.702
comprehensive tax plan.,1070.102,1.168
And I think there&amp;#39;s eagerness on behalf of,1071.27,1.968
Congress to do that as well.,1073.238,1.769
"So, that -- that is a very promising thing, but I would",1075.007,2.436
"also note that when you look, not just at the ups",1077.443,2.669
"and downs of a market, but you look at consumer",1080.112,2.202
confidence and a lot of the other market indicators.,1082.314,2.336
This -- a Trump Presidency brought a lot of confidence,1084.65,3.837
"back to traders, to investors -- more",1088.487,2.336
"importantly, to job creators.",1090.823,1.835
And you look at the number of individuals -- the small,1092.658,2.135
"businesses, the large businesses, the auto makers",1094.793,3.237
"-- all coming in and saying to the President, &amp;quot;I want to",1098.03,2.202
be part of your effort -- your agenda to make the,1100.232,3.77
country better; to grow jobs here; to bring jobs back,1104.002,3.204
"here.&amp;quot; I think it&amp;#39;s a positive sign, not just on",1107.206,3.57
"the ups and downs of one day&amp;#39;s market fluctuation,",1110.776,3.003
but the overall commitment that businesses have to --,1113.779,3.737
to want to work with this Administration.,1117.516,2.402
To add jobs; to create better jobs; to add,1119.918,2.703
benefits; to find out how the President can ease the,1122.621,3.37
"regulatory burden they face, so it&amp;#39;s a holistic process",1125.991,3.971
that is being undertaken to unleash the American economy.,1129.962,3.136
"And it&amp;#39;s the approach that he&amp;#39;s taking, not just in",1133.098,2.536
small businesses and large businesses and with union,1135.634,2.402
"workers, but he&amp;#39;s looking the energy sector.",1138.036,2.269
"How do we unleash America&amp;#39;s natural resources, not just",1140.305,3.003
"to help us make more in energy independent, but how",1143.308,2.903
do we do that to create good paying jobs in America as,1146.211,2.303
well and get that economic boom that can come out of it?,1148.514,2.936
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1152.651,0.601
"The Press: Sean, two questions -- one, how",1153.952,2.836
important is national security information to you?,1156.788,4.772
How would -- you&amp;#39;re saying that they&amp;#39;re at the table,1161.56,2.102
and they can come to the table if they wanted some,1163.662,2.269
"meetings, how --",1165.931,1.101
"Mr. Spicer: Oh, no, no.",1167.499,0.801
That&amp;#39;s not what I said. Just to be clear --,1168.3,0.634
The Press: Okay.,1169.501,0.634
Mr. Spicer: -- I just -- I don&amp;#39;t think I can underscore,1170.769,0.834
this enough.,1171.603,0.834
"What we&amp;#39;re saying is, nothing has changed.",1172.437,1.902
"We&amp;#39;ve, in fact, added grown this.",1174.339,1.669
The Director of National Intelligence and the,1176.008,3.036
"Chairman of the Joint Chiefs are, by statute, part of the",1179.044,3.437
-- of the NSC -- full stock.,1182.481,2.636
What we&amp;#39;ve done is made sure that on issues of homeland,1185.117,2.536
"security and domestic policy, they are always",1187.653,2.235
"welcome to attend, 100 percent, however, if the",1189.888,2.736
"issue is on, you know, pandemic flu or other",1192.624,3.003
"domestic type natures that don&amp;#39;t involve the military,",1195.627,2.736
it would be a waste of time to drag the Chairman of the,1198.363,2.369
Joint Chief of staff over.,1200.732,0.768
If he wants to attend he&amp;#39;s part of the committee.,1201.5,2.569
He can come any time.,1204.069,1.235
"So, to try to talk about downgrading or not taking",1205.304,3.103
this seriously is a misreading of this.,1208.407,2.335
It&amp;#39;s really a disservice.,1210.742,1.669
And I think that for those people who took the time to,1212.411,2.002
read it they understand that.,1214.413,1.368
But I&amp;#39;ve seen so much misreporting all this,1215.781,3.103
weekend about downgrading this individual or upgrading.,1218.884,2.969
The language could not be clearer.,1221.853,1.969
It is 100 percent identical.,1223.822,2.069
"And so, any misreading of it otherwise is a spread of",1225.891,4.671
misinformation.,1230.562,0.901
Plain and simple.,1231.463,0.701
"The Press: Okay, so you&amp;#39;re saying they&amp;#39;re at the table.",1232.164,2.068
But --,1234.232,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, no.",1234.9,0.734
I&amp;#39;m saying they&amp;#39;ve always been at the table and they,1235.634,1.735
continue to be and that he has a tremendous amount of,1237.369,1.969
respect for him.,1239.338,0.667
"And so, any reporting otherwise is a",1240.005,2.069
misunderstanding of it 100 percent.,1242.074,2.269
"The Press: Sean, let me ask my question.",1244.343,2.769
Mr. Spicer: Okay.,1248.246,0.634
"The Press: Okay, they&amp;#39;re at the table.",1249.615,0.6
But how important are their suggestions or their,1250.215,1.034
statements to this administration?,1251.249,1.135
Mr. Spicer: Unbelievable.,1253.185,0.934
When you look at Secretary Mattis who was,1254.119,1.869
in the Oval Office.,1255.988,0.867
He was on the phone with CIA Director Pompeo this after,1256.855,4.438
-- or this morning.,1261.293,1.268
He has had -- he values their opinion.,1262.561,2.803
I don&amp;#39;t think you can express in words how much,1265.364,3.303
respect he has whether it&amp;#39;s Chairman Dunford or General,1268.667,2.836
"Mattis, General Kelley, Secretary --",1271.503,2.302
I mean Director Pompeo.,1273.805,1.535
All of these individuals I think he&amp;#39;s shown through,1275.34,2.236
deed and action and word how much he cares about them.,1277.576,2.769
The first stop he made was to the CIA because of how,1280.345,3.437
much he values the work that they do and the respect that,1283.782,2.736
he has for them.,1286.518,0.667
So I don&amp;#39;t -- I really don&amp;#39;t know how much more he can do,1287.185,3.17
to show how much he values them.,1290.355,1.568
"The Press: My second question, my last question.",1293.025,2.535
When you talk about these seven countries -- these,1295.56,4.071
Muslim majority countries -- talking to a former official,1299.631,4.438
in the Obama administration from Homeland Security,1304.069,3.136
they&amp;#39;re saying that what you&amp;#39;re doing is very,1307.205,2.036
"different from what they did, and it&amp;#39;s much more restrictive.",1309.241,3.77
What do you say to that?,1313.011,0.734
Mr. Spicer: That we&amp;#39;re going to put the safety of,1313.745,1.802
Americans first.,1315.547,1.468
"We&amp;#39;re not going to wait and react, as I said in the",1317.015,1.769
statement.,1318.784,1.268
The President&amp;#39;s going to be very proactive with,1320.052,1.901
protecting this country.,1321.953,0.868
We&amp;#39;re not going to wait till we get attacked and figure,1322.821,1.869
out how we can make sure it doesn&amp;#39;t happen again.,1324.69,2.035
He&amp;#39;s going to do everything in his power to stop every,1326.725,2.736
threat that we face in this country,1329.461,1.468
and every potential threat.,1330.929,1.602
And that&amp;#39;s the key point in this.,1332.531,1.668
How do we get ahead of threats?,1334.199,2.402
How do we keep America ahead of the curve when it comes,1336.601,3.404
to people who want to do us harm?,1340.005,1.635
And that&amp;#39;s what the President&amp;#39;s done.,1341.64,1.401
Is he&amp;#39;s made sure that every way possible we get down the,1343.041,3.103
"path of securing this country, putting America&amp;#39;s",1346.144,2.436
safety and security first and foremost bar none.,1348.58,2.903
Major Garrett.,1351.483,0.667
"The Press: Sean, you suggested over the weekend",1352.15,2.469
and so did Steven Miller that the action taken on the,1354.619,3.337
executive order might have been related to some,1357.956,2.736
specific intelligence and it was necessary to prevent,1360.692,3.404
something from happening.,1364.096,0.9
And any questions about why certain agencies may not,1364.996,3.337
have been as briefed up can be explained in part because,1368.333,2.736
it needed to happen right away.,1371.069,1.568
Can you --,1372.637,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: Well, no -- yeah.",1373.305,1.902
Just to explain that.,1375.207,0.967
"Yeah, thank you.",1376.174,0.768
I appreciate that opportunity.,1376.942,2.002
I think what we&amp;#39;re trying to say is you don&amp;#39;t know when,1378.944,1.935
the next threat&amp;#39;s coming.,1380.879,1.501
You don&amp;#39;t know when the next attack&amp;#39;s coming.,1382.38,1.969
And so the best you can do is to get ahead of it.,1384.349,2.236
"Because if you wait, you&amp;#39;re going to be reacting.",1386.585,2.802
And what I think I want to be clear on is the,1389.387,1.902
President&amp;#39;s not going to wait.,1391.289,1.535
He&amp;#39;s going to make sure he does everything in his power,1392.824,2.269
when he can to protect the homeland and his people.,1395.093,2.77
That&amp;#39;s it.,1397.863,0.667
And so getting ahead of threats is the key.,1398.53,2.636
"Not waiting till they happen, not saying, &amp;quot;Hey,",1401.166,2.202
once it happens how do we react to make sure it,1403.368,1.702
doesn&amp;#39;t happen again?&amp;quot;,1405.07,1.068
I think what I want to be clear about is that since,1406.138,2.669
becoming President he&amp;#39;s continued to take steps,1408.807,2.536
through executive order and otherwise to make sure that,1411.343,3.303
this country is as safe as can be and that we&amp;#39;re ahead,1414.646,2.769
of every threat.,1417.415,0.668
"The Press: In other words, it was not put in place on",1418.083,2.736
the timeline it was put in place and the procedures it,1420.819,2.869
was put in place because of specific intelligence that,1423.688,3.671
was suggesting something needed --,1427.359,1.401
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, no. No, no. I&amp;#39;m not saying that at all.",1430.195,0.734
"The Press: Okay, I just wanted to make sure on that.",1431.63,0.667
Mr. Spicer: All I&amp;#39;m saying is that his view in general,1432.998,1.501
is not to wait to get ahead of the curve.,1434.499,2.102
Are -- his -- there wasn&amp;#39;t a specific threat that was,1436.601,2.503
"saying, &amp;quot;You have to do this Saturday.",1439.104,1.635
Sunday will be --&amp;quot; But we just -- the point that I&amp;#39;m,1440.739,1.935
trying to make is that we don&amp;#39;t know when that hour comes.,1442.674,3.704
We don&amp;#39;t know when that individual crosses into our,1446.378,2.102
border to do us harm.,1448.48,1.535
And so the idea of waiting when you don&amp;#39;t know -- could,1450.015,3.236
it be that night?,1453.251,0.668
Could it be the next day? Could it be the next week?,1453.919,1.902
"And the President&amp;#39;s view is, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not going to wait.",1455.821,2.102
I&amp;#39;m going to make sure that we protect the homeland and,1457.923,2.068
its people as soon as possible with every measure,1459.991,2.303
that I can.,1462.294,0.667
John Roberts?,1462.961,0.667
The Press: Just following up on that a little bit and,1463.628,2.469
I&amp;#39;ve got two questions unrelated.,1466.097,1.769
So I&amp;#39;ll ask (inaudible).,1467.866,2.235
Number of legal challenges against this executive order.,1470.101,3.237
What&amp;#39;s your level of confidence that you will,1473.338,1.869
prevail legally and what&amp;#39;s the basis for that level of,1475.207,3.036
confidence?,1478.243,0.734
Mr. Spicer: Well -- and the most prominent case is the,1479.678,1.268
one in the eastern district of New York.,1480.946,1.801
And I think the -- we won&amp;#39;t even have to prevail in that case.,1482.747,3.07
It doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense.,1485.817,1.068
It deals with people who are being deported.,1486.885,2.402
"The action never spoke to it, never intended",1489.287,2.736
to deport people.,1492.023,0.768
It had to do with how do we process people in and detain,1492.791,3.003
them until we ascertain whether or not they can --,1495.794,3.236
they can -- they sought to do us any harm.,1499.03,3.437
"And again, remember we&amp;#39;re talking about a universe",1502.467,1.702
of 109 people.,1504.169,1.268
"There were 325,000 people that came into this country",1505.437,4.538
over a 24-hour period from another country.,1509.975,1.801
One hundred and nine of them were stopped for additional,1511.776,2.536
screening.,1514.312,1.302
"This is -- we&amp;#39;ve got to keep this in proportion, folks.",1515.614,3.203
This is -- this is 109 people being stopped out of,1518.817,2.903
325 over a 24-hour period.,1521.72,3.403
And I know that everyone likes to get where they want,1525.79,2.103
to get to as quick as possible and I think the,1527.893,3.069
government did a phenomenal job of making sure that we,1530.962,2.803
processed people through.,1533.765,1.435
But we did so knowing so that the people who were,1535.2,2.269
coming in hadn&amp;#39;t done anything that was seeking to,1537.469,2.669
do us harm.,1540.138,0.768
"That&amp;#39;s it, plain and simple.",1540.906,0.967
And I think that&amp;#39;s an important thing to know.,1541.873,1.702
That when you actually look at the perspective of what&amp;#39;s,1543.575,3.103
going on and you note the polls that were going up,1546.678,1.902
"this morning -- you know, a majority of Americans agree",1548.58,2.135
with the President.,1550.715,1.035
They recognize the steps that he&amp;#39;s taken were to keep,1551.75,3.737
this country safe and to make sure that we didn&amp;#39;t,1555.487,2.135
"look back and say, &amp;quot;I wish we had done the following.&amp;quot;",1557.622,2.069
The Press: (inaudible) Donnelly&amp;#39;s order is just,1559.691,2.102
one of a number.,1561.793,0.934
"There&amp;#39;s four I believe, right?",1562.727,0.868
Mr. Spicer: And I don&amp;#39;t think any of the others are,1564.362,1.802
pertaining.,1566.164,0.667
All of the action -- all of the enforcement and action,1566.831,2.636
regarding the executive order is in place and it,1569.467,2.069
still remains right now.,1571.536,0.968
And we feel pretty confident that if there&amp;#39;s any problems,1572.504,2.569
we&amp;#39;ll prevail.,1575.073,0.667
"It is -- again, this is a national security issue.",1575.74,3.671
These seven countries were derived from what the Obama,1579.411,2.769
administration had deemed as needing further travel,1582.18,2.703
restriction.,1584.883,0.934
We followed through on that and as we continue to go,1585.817,1.835
"through this 90-day process review, we&amp;#39;re going to make",1587.652,3.037
sure that we put a system in place that vets -- extreme,1590.689,3.436
vets these people who are coming into our country that,1594.125,2.603
could potentially do us harm.,1596.728,2.736
Plain and simple.,1599.464,0.734
John Gizzi.,1600.198,0.534
"The Press: Second question for you, Sean.",1601.333,0.9
"Mr. Spicer: I forgot, John said two.",1602.701,0.7
The Press: You can&amp;#39;t forget things like that.,1604.002,0.6
Mr. Spicer: I -- well.,1605.236,0.735
The Press: What&amp;#39;s the President&amp;#39;s response to Iran,1606.504,1.869
flagrantly thumbing its nose at the UN Security Council?,1608.373,1.501
Mr. Spicer: We&amp;#39;re aware of --,1609.874,1.001
The Press: Or -- and if I could just finish.,1611.676,2.136
Prime Minister Netanyahu who you mentioned will be coming,1613.812,1.902
here on the 15th is looking to the White House for more,1615.714,3.236
sanctions against Iran.,1618.95,1.502
Mr. Spicer: And I think we&amp;#39;re looking into that.,1620.452,1.968
We&amp;#39;re aware that Iran fired that missile.,1622.42,1.936
"We&amp;#39;re looking into the exact nature of it, and I&amp;#39;ll try",1624.356,2.569
to have more for you later,1626.925,0.867
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",1627.792,1.802
Mr. Spicer: John Gizzi.,1629.594,1.435
The Press: Thank you very much.,1632.397,0.934
Two brief questions.,1633.331,1.468
"First, the President of ZOA -- Zionists of America --",1634.799,4.638
put out a statement following the President&amp;#39;s,1639.437,4.905
proclamation on the Holocaust saying that they,1644.342,2.936
omission of Jews and what they experienced was &amp;quot;painful.&amp;quot;,1647.278,6.574
Is the President aware of some criticism from the,1653.852,2.469
American Jewish community?,1656.321,1.535
And does he plan to do anything about it?,1657.856,1.768
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think he&amp;#39;s aware of what people",1660.425,2.603
"have been saying, but I think by and large he&amp;#39;s been",1663.028,1.801
praised for it.,1664.829,0.801
I think the President recognized the tremendous,1665.63,2.87
loss of life that came from the Holocaust.,1668.5,2.202
"But I think with respect to, you know, Israel and the",1670.702,3.403
Jewish people specifically there&amp;#39;s been no better,1674.105,2.937
friend than Donald Trump when it comes to protecting,1677.042,3.169
"Israel, building a better friendship with Israel.",1680.211,2.97
You look at what Prime Minister Netanyahu&amp;#39;s talked,1683.181,2.069
about.,1685.25,0.667
He welcomes this administration.,1685.917,1.435
He appreciates the friendship and respect that,1687.352,3.236
he has shown to Israel and to the Jewish people.,1690.588,2.903
"But to suggest otherwise, John, I frankly -- I got to",1693.491,3.17
be honest.,1696.661,0.667
The President went out of his way to recognize the,1697.328,1.836
Holocaust and the suffering that went through it and the,1699.164,3.136
people that were affected by it and the loss of life.,1702.3,2.703
And to make sure that America never forgets what,1705.003,3.036
"so many people went through whether they were Jews,",1708.039,2.636
"they&amp;#39;re Gypsies, gays, disability -- I mean priests",1710.675,3.67
-- and I&amp;#39;m not -- I get it.,1714.345,1.335
But at the end of the day I don&amp;#39;t think when you look at,1715.68,2.469
the state of Israel or the Jewish people themselves --,1718.149,3.537
I think there has been no better friend to Donald Trump.,1721.686,2.436
Especially after the last eight years.,1724.122,2.135
"The tremendous respect that he&amp;#39;s shown Israel, the",1726.257,2.269
Jewish people -- and to suggest anything otherwise,1728.526,2.87
is frankly a little disappointing.,1731.396,2.169
I&amp;#39;m sorry -- okay.,1733.565,0.934
The Press: Second question.,1735.033,0.801
Mr. Spicer: We&amp;#39;re getting way too good at second questions.,1736.634,0.835
The Press: Thank you.,1738.703,1.802
The -- several NGOs that have helped people from the,1740.505,4.137
countries affected have said they specifically have,1744.642,3.337
focused on people who interpreted for our military.,1747.979,2.536
Mr. Spicer: Right.,1751.015,0.634
The Press: And said they would be affected by this.,1752.217,1.134
I believe Secretary Mattis said he hoped you specify,1753.351,4.037
that to give these people a better shot at it.,1757.388,3.204
Is there going to be any change?,1760.592,1.501
Mr. Spicer: Well you look at that one -- that one,1762.66,1.101
interpreter yesterday came back who was interviewed on,1763.761,1.769
"television said, &amp;quot;I love Donald Trump.&amp;quot;",1765.53,1.969
I think we recognize that people who&amp;#39;ve served this,1767.499,1.735
country we should make sure that in those cases they&amp;#39;re,1769.234,2.235
helped out.,1771.469,0.668
But that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that we just give them a pass.,1772.137,2.535
"The Obama administration, I think it was 2009, let two",1774.672,2.269
people through the Iraqi program in.,1776.941,2.002
Those people came to the United States and tried to,1778.943,2.703
plan an attack in Kentucky.,1781.646,2.035
I think that we&amp;#39;ve got to recognize that people who,1783.681,2.036
have helped this country or served this nation might not,1785.717,2.502
be citizens at the time want to come here -- that we need,1788.219,3.804
to appreciate the service that they&amp;#39;ve had.,1792.023,2.202
That doesn&amp;#39;t mean that we don&amp;#39;t let them in without a,1794.225,1.969
certain degree of vetting.,1796.194,1.034
And I think that&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re going to do to make,1797.228,2.169
"sure again, that the onus is on us to make sure that",1799.397,2.536
we&amp;#39;re protecting the American people and that,1801.933,2.202
people want to come into this country do so in a,1804.135,2.903
peaceful way.,1807.038,1.268
"Margaret, sorry",1808.306,0.667
"The Press: In the departure, I&amp;#39;d like to ask you about",1811.643,1.234
Dodd-Frank.,1812.877,1.869
President Trump said this morning he&amp;#39;s going to do a,1814.746,2.369
big number on Dodd-Frank and I wanted to know what was,1817.115,5.172
the timeframe for the big number?,1822.287,2.769
Is this legislation that you&amp;#39;re looking at teaming up,1825.056,3.637
with Republican lawmakers on?,1828.693,1.468
Or do you think that the big number can mostly be handled,1830.161,3.57
through an executive action?,1833.731,1.368
Mr. Spicer: I think we&amp;#39;re continuing to work with the,1835.733,1.402
legislative affairs team on that.,1837.135,1.334
But I think today what you saw was the first step down,1838.469,2.536
the path of regulatory relief to our nation&amp;#39;s small,1841.005,3.27
and large businesses as well.,1844.275,1.869
And I think that he understands -- especially as,1846.144,2.602
a business man himself and someone who&amp;#39;s been involved,1848.746,2.47
in financing -- that the impact that Dodd-Frank has,1851.216,2.469
had on lending in particular and the impact that it has,1853.685,3.169
on small and large businesses.,1856.854,1.402
"So, I&amp;#39;m not -- I think we&amp;#39;re going to continue to walk --",1858.256,2.569
work with Congress on reform and we&amp;#39;ll have more for you,1860.825,4.505
on that at some point in the future.,1865.33,2.235
I&amp;#39;m sorry.,1867.565,1.135
We&amp;#39;re doing two-for days.,1868.7,0.834
The Press: Oh that&amp;#39;s great. Okay.,1869.534,1.902
I&amp;#39;m wondering any -- do you expect an EO on H1Bs as part,1871.436,7.04
of all this coming any time soon?,1878.476,1.935
"And also, I just wanted you to be aware that President",1880.411,2.269
"Obama, through his spokesman, has now issued a",1882.68,3.737
statement on the executive order.,1886.417,2.002
"Mr. Spicer: Okay, thank you.",1889.387,2.069
"I think with respect to H1Bs and other Visas, it&amp;#39;s part",1891.456,3.27
of a larger immigration reform effort that the,1894.726,2.969
President will continue to talk about through executive,1897.695,1.902
order and through working with Congress.,1899.597,2.536
But you&amp;#39;ve already seen a lot of action on immigration,1902.133,2.102
and I think whether it&amp;#39;s that or the spousal visas or,1904.235,3.771
"other types of visas, I think there&amp;#39;s an overall",1908.006,1.835
need to look at all these programs.,1909.841,2.536
And you&amp;#39;ll see both through executive action and through,1912.377,2.269
comprehensive legislative measures a way to address,1914.646,3.47
immigration as a whole and the Visa program.,1918.116,1.968
Zeke?,1920.084,0.668
"The Press: Since we&amp;#39;re doing two, I got two for you.",1921.653,3.069
On the -- on the -- on the NSC reorganization with,1924.722,2.903
regards to the President&amp;#39;s Chief Strategist being on,1927.625,2.703
"the NSC, that wasn&amp;#39;t something that existed",1930.328,1.835
certainly in President Obama&amp;#39;s tenure.,1932.163,2.302
What does that speak about Mr. Bannon&amp;#39;s role within the,1934.465,3.704
"White House, within the policy decision making",1938.169,1.935
structure?,1940.104,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: Well, let&amp;#39;s be -- let&amp;#39;s be honest.",1941.472,1.435
"I mean, David Axelrod walked in and out of NSC meetings",1943.441,1.602
quite frequently by his own account and by several of,1945.043,2.369
your accounts.,1947.412,1.902
What this shows is that this administration is being,1949.314,1.968
rather transparent.,1951.282,1.535
That it&amp;#39;s putting out in the public who&amp;#39;s going to be,1952.817,3.537
going in and out of those meetings not just letting,1956.354,2.135
people go in willy nilly.,1958.489,1.335
I think it shows that this administration&amp;#39;s trying to,1959.824,2.336
make sure that we don&amp;#39;t hide things and wait for them to,1962.16,2.536
come out after the fact.,1964.696,1.568
"So, it recognizes the role that he&amp;#39;s going to play.",1966.264,2.469
But Steve&amp;#39;s not going to be in every meeting.,1968.733,2.102
"Like Axelrod, he&amp;#39;ll come in and out when needed.",1970.835,2.469
But I think we wanted to be up front about it and make,1973.304,2.503
sure that was stated so it wasn&amp;#39;t a story when he did.,1975.807,4.004
Yeah?,1979.811,0.567
The Press: One more.,1980.878,0.601
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sorry. I forgot.,1982.08,0.8
The Press: Sorry.,1983.548,0.6
"Just on the Yemen strike over the weekend, can you",1984.148,1.035
talk a little bit about the President&amp;#39;s personal,1985.183,1.368
involvement?,1986.551,0.901
"I mean, this seems to be the first major order he&amp;#39;s",1987.452,2.035
given.,1989.487,0.934
"And separately, does he intend to speak with the",1990.421,1.735
family of the fallen service member?,1992.156,1.168
Mr. Spicer: Thanks.,1994.192,1.001
"He was -- you know, obviously aware of the",1995.193,1.401
strike occurring.,1996.594,1.068
He was kept in constant contact Saturday night of,1997.662,4.004
the status of the mission of both the success that it had,2001.666,4.938
and the -- and the tragic loss of life that occurred,2006.604,2.302
to that member.,2008.906,2.002
We are currently following Department of Defense next,2010.908,3.037
of kin procedures and as soon as it is appropriate,2013.945,4.171
the President will be speaking with the family members.,2018.116,2.869
Yes?,2020.985,0.667
"The Press: (inaudible) on North Korea ICBM, North",2021.652,5.973
Korea announced that if the United States intercept,2027.625,4.037
"ICBM, it would be the war.",2031.662,3.304
How did you response on this?,2034.966,1.468
Mr. Spicer: How did we what?,2037.769,0.634
The Press: How did you response on North Korea it,2038.936,2.436
would be the war if you intercept those ICBM?,2041.372,2.536
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sorry --,2046.177,0.601
The Press: How did you respond?,2047.311,0.668
How did you respond?,2047.979,0.834
Mr. Spicer: How did we respond to North Korea?,2049.414,0.734
The Press: Yes.,2050.148,0.667
Mr. Spicer: We&amp;#39;re working through diplomatic channels,2051.449,0.767
on that.,2052.216,0.601
I don&amp;#39;t have any further readout on that.,2052.817,1.368
The Press: One more.,2054.819,3.07
Yesterday -- I&amp;#39;m sorry -- President Trump called with,2057.889,4.871
"acting President (inaudible) Korea and also, they said",2062.76,5.673
that U.S.,2068.433,0.9
and South Korea agreed to strengthen jointed defense,2069.333,5.172
abilities.,2074.505,1.335
What is that particulars of --,2075.84,2.436
Mr. Spicer: They spoke last night about 7:00.,2078.876,1.268
There was a readout provided to that call and I think,2080.144,2.036
we&amp;#39;ll have further steps to announce in follow up to,2082.18,2.869
"that call, but I think the read out speaks for itself.",2085.049,1.535
Mike?,2086.584,0.667
The Press: I want to ask about the Supreme Court pick.,2087.251,1.502
Can you talk about why he&amp;#39;s moved that pick up to,2088.753,3.37
"tomorrow night, it sounds like?",2092.123,2.769
Can you tell us who the pick is?,2094.892,2.97
And is the pick off the list he&amp;#39;s been using?,2097.862,3.403
Is he 100 percent sure that this is the pick?,2101.265,1.502
Mr. Spicer: He is 100 percent sure he&amp;#39;s the pick.,2103.568,1.835
This individual is part of the list that he put out.,2105.403,2.602
It maintains exactly what he said he was going to do.,2108.005,5.139
But I&amp;#39;m not going to share any further guidance on that.,2113.144,3.07
I appreciate the try.,2116.214,1.234
"The Press: You said he, Sean?",2117.448,1.902
When you said he&amp;#39;s?,2119.35,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I said the individual.,2120.017,2.303
(laughter),2122.854,0.7
The Press: You also said he.,2124.222,0.667
"You said, &amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s the one.&amp;quot;",2124.889,0.667
"The Press: Sean, just following up on the",2126.257,3.337
President&amp;#39;s comments last week that three million,2129.594,3.169
illegal immigrants voted in the election.,2132.763,2.169
You guys said that he would have an executive order on,2134.932,1.869
the subject.,2136.801,0.834
Is he still planning to do that?,2137.635,1.201
Or has he changed his mind?,2138.836,0.834
Mr. Spicer: Yes.,2140.271,0.567
He still has plans to do that.,2140.838,0.668
The Press: And then a second -- just a second follow up,2142.206,1.101
on your statement about the Holocaust statement.,2143.307,4.071
"Last night, the Republican Jewish Coalition called it",2147.378,2.936
an unfortunate omission that your -- that the White House,2150.314,3.704
did not acknowledge the Jewish people or,2154.018,2.87
anti-Semitism --,2156.888,0.734
Mr. Spicer: They weren&amp;#39;t in President Bush&amp;#39;s,2158.289,0.767
acknowledgement either.,2159.056,0.534
The Press: -- explicitly.,2160.224,0.901
"It was -- President Bush did mention anti-Semitism, so --",2161.125,1.402
Mr. Spicer: I think --,2163.294,0.734
The Press: -- can you explain why you decided to,2165.396,1.702
depart from bipartisan tradition of two Presidents.,2167.098,2.235
Mr. Spicer: It&amp;#39;s not -- the statement was written with,2170.001,4.204
the help of an individual who&amp;#39;s both Jewish and the,2174.205,2.135
descendants of Holocaust survivors.,2176.34,2.503
To suggest that remembering the Holocaust and,2178.843,4.838
"acknowledging all of the people Jewish, Gypsies,",2183.681,3.136
"priests, disabled, gays, and lesbian -- I mean, it&amp;#39;s -- I",2186.817,3.237
-- it is pathetic that people are picking on a,2190.054,2.402
statement.,2192.456,0.668
I remember we issued a statement at Christmas time,2193.124,2.469
calling Christ the king and many of the reporters that,2195.593,2.336
are in this room and otherwise started wondering,2197.929,1.801
whether we were referring to the king as the,2199.73,2.536
President-elect.,2202.266,0.668
Do you know how offensive that was to Christians?,2202.934,2.702
I mean I -- the idea that you&amp;#39;re nitpicking a,2205.636,4.204
statement that&amp;#39;s sought to remember this tragic event,2209.84,4.839
that occurred and the people who died in it is just,2214.679,3.503
ridiculous.,2218.182,0.667
I think he acknowledged the suffering that existed and,2218.849,5.706
wants to make sure that it&amp;#39;s enshrined in the American,2224.555,1.969
"people&amp;#39;s memory, so that something like this never,",2226.524,2.135
ever happens again.,2228.659,1.035
And I think to sit there and suggest that he was trying,2229.694,3.136
to single out anything and a people of which he has shown,2232.83,3.737
such tremendous respect for and such a willingness in,2236.567,3.404
terms of the state of Israel to go out there and show the,2239.971,2.902
partnership that needs to exist between us and the,2242.873,2.937
respect.,2245.81,0.667
"And when you contrast that, frankly, a statement -- a",2246.477,3.036
statement and you look at the actions of the last,2249.513,3.07
administration.,2252.583,0.834
"The Iran Nuclear deal, them giving Palestine an equal",2253.851,5.339
footing in terms of the amendment that was passed,2259.19,1.635
through the UN Security Council on their way out the,2260.825,2.035
door -- to compare a statement that remembers the,2262.86,3.871
Holocaust with the actions of the last eight years and,2266.731,3.57
the disrespect that was shown to Israel is,2270.301,2.636
unbelievable.,2272.937,1.101
Where were the questions about the UN Security,2274.038,2.269
Council resolution that came forward?,2276.307,2.035
And the idea of this unprecedented step that the,2278.342,2.836
outgoing administration took as a massive slap in the,2281.178,4.171
face of Israel.,2285.349,0.968
Where were the questions then?,2286.317,1.234
"The Press: You said Jared Kushner wrote the statement,",2288.519,0.968
Sean?,2289.487,0.6
"Mr. Spicer: No, I didn&amp;#39;t.",2290.688,0.6
Did I say that?,2291.288,0.501
No.,2291.789,0.601
The Press: You mentioned that a --,2292.39,0.567
"Mr. Spicer: I know what I said, I didn&amp;#39;t say Jared&amp;#39;s name.",2293.624,0.968
The Press: You&amp;#39;re saying it was not Jared?,2295.259,1.001
"Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not -- but I&amp;#39;m just saying -- no, I&amp;#39;m",2296.861,0.834
"not getting into who wrote it, but he has several",2297.695,1.935
members of the Jewish faith on his senior staff and to,2299.63,2.87
suggest that it was an omission of anything else is,2302.5,3.136
kind of ridiculous.,2305.636,1.101
Yeah.,2306.737,0.734
"The Press: Sean, there&amp;#39;s a -- I think I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;re",2308.139,3.77
aware there&amp;#39;s a dissent cable that&amp;#39;s being,2311.909,1.935
circulated inside the State Department and takes issue,2313.844,3.737
with the executive order.,2317.581,1.802
Are you aware of it?,2319.383,0.734
What&amp;#39;s your reaction to it?,2320.117,1.201
And are you concerned that you are facing a bureaucracy,2321.318,2.837
at the State Department that may not be working in the,2324.155,3.503
same direction you are?,2327.658,1.535
"And if -- since it is two-for Monday, the second",2329.193,3.47
"thing is, if I could press you a little bit on the very",2332.663,1.702
first question you were asked on safe zones.,2334.365,2.636
President Trump said a couple of times before the,2337.001,3.103
election that he wanted Persian Gulf countries not,2340.104,3.337
"only to be open to this, but to support it.",2343.441,2.535
To pay for it.,2345.976,1.035
Does the -- is that the request he made of the King,2347.011,3.07
of Saudi Arabia in the phone call over the weekend?,2350.081,1.801
"Mr. Spicer: So, on the first part -- the first part dealt",2353.05,5.139
with?,2358.189,0.8
The Press: The dissent.,2359.49,0.601
"Mr. Spicer: Yes, we&amp;#39;re aware of that.",2360.691,0.734
This is a procedure that is part of the State,2361.425,1.468
Department&amp;#39;s way of letting career officials -- career,2362.893,2.87
foreign service officers express themselves.,2365.763,2.102
"Obviously, we&amp;#39;re aware of it.",2367.865,2.236
But I think that any government official or,2370.101,3.203
anyone who doesn&amp;#39;t understand the President&amp;#39;s,2373.304,2.002
"goal in this and what this actually was -- again, I",2375.306,3.437
think this has been blown way out of proportion and,2378.743,1.935
exaggerated.,2380.678,1.234
"Again, you talk about in a 24-hour period 325,000",2381.912,3.404
people from other countries flew in through our airports.,2385.316,3.003
And we&amp;#39;re talking about 109 people from seven countries,2388.319,2.736
that the Obama administration identified.,2391.055,2.469
And these career bureaucrats have a problem with it?,2393.524,3.07
"I think that they should either get with the program,",2396.594,1.701
or they can go.,2398.295,0.668
The Press: Sean --,2399.63,0.734
"Mr. Spicer: Hold on, hold on.",2400.898,0.834
This is about the safety of America and there&amp;#39;s a reason,2401.732,3.437
that the majority of Americans agree,2405.169,1.568
with the President.,2406.737,1.201
It&amp;#39;s because they understand that&amp;#39;s his number one,2407.938,2.002
"priority and it&amp;#39;s his number one duty, as it should be",2409.94,2.536
"with any leader, to keep our people and our institutions",2412.476,3.237
"safe from attack, and that these steps are, frankly,",2415.713,2.602
common sense steps that the President&amp;#39;s taking to make,2418.315,3.37
sure that we&amp;#39;re never looking in the rearview,2421.685,1.502
"mirror saying, &amp;quot;We should have done something like this.&amp;quot;",2423.187,2.636
And then --,2425.823,1.201
"The Press: So, he asked for them to pay for this",2428.092,1.168
(inaudible)?,2429.26,0.6
Mr. Spicer: He did have a conversation about financing,2430.327,1.035
"with them as well, yes.",2431.362,2.502
Cecilia?,2433.864,0.634
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",2435.065,1.168
President Obama -- his statement that was just,2436.233,1.702
referenced earlier -- said that he&amp;#39;s heartened by the,2437.935,1.969
level of engagement taking place in communities,2439.904,2.535
around the country.,2442.439,1.502
"Does President Trump have a message for the protesters,",2443.941,2.636
and does he have a message for the 109 people that you,2446.577,2.336
just mentioned?,2448.913,1.001
"And since it&amp;#39;s two-for-Monday, on this memo",2449.914,4.437
"about the plan to defeat ISIS, the President",2454.351,2.837
campaigned and said that he had a plan to defeat ISIS.,2457.188,1.668
Does he?,2458.856,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Yes, he does, and he&amp;#39;s talking to his",2460.191,0.867
generals to make sure that they provide him with the,2461.058,2.202
feedback necessary to implement it.,2463.26,1.702
That is an ongoing conversation that he,2464.962,1.468
"continues to have with both the Joint Chiefs, Secretary",2466.43,3.137
"of State designee, the Homeland Security Secretary,",2469.567,3.536
and the Secretary of Defense.,2473.103,1.202
But he has been having that conversation within his,2474.305,1.868
"national security council, within his advisers, to make",2476.173,2.703
sure that he has that.,2478.876,0.934
He has tasked the Joint Chiefs with a plan to come,2479.81,2.736
up with and implement some of his recommendations and,2482.546,2.536
some of theirs to make sure that we can defeat ISIS.,2485.082,2.503
"The Press: And on the message, please, to",2487.585,2.602
"protesters, and specifically, to the",2490.187,1.335
families who this weekend were caught up in this?,2491.522,2.035
Mr. Spicer: Yeah.,2494.191,0.634
I think that it&amp;#39;s a shame that people were,2494.825,1.668
"inconvenienced, obviously, but at the end of the day,",2496.493,2.37
we&amp;#39;re talking about a couple hours.,2498.863,1.935
"I would rather -- you know, I&amp;#39;m sorry that some folks",2500.798,3.403
"may have had to wait a little while, but I think",2504.201,2.269
the President would much rather know that he&amp;#39;s not,2506.47,2.636
placing a call to someone who was killed because,2509.106,2.536
someone was let in this country to commit a,2511.642,1.568
"terrorist act, or keep -- if you weigh the calls that we",2513.21,3.57
"have to have, someone being temporarily inconvenienced",2516.78,3.504
coming into an airport -- and I think when you do talk,2520.284,1.902
"to some of those people -- as I mentioned, a couple of",2522.186,2.002
"them were interviewed and said, &amp;quot;We understand that",2524.188,1.334
the President was doing this in the best interest of the,2525.522,2.002
country.&amp;quot;,2527.524,0.668
"Look, coming into this country is still a privilege.",2528.325,2.903
We&amp;#39;re the greatest country on earth and being able to,2531.228,3.003
"come to America is a privilege, not a right.",2534.231,2.936
"It is our duty, and it is the President&amp;#39;s goal, to",2537.167,3.27
"make sure that everybody who comes into this country, to",2540.437,2.536
"the best of our ability, is here because they want to",2542.973,2.803
enjoy this country and come in peacefully.,2545.776,1.802
"And so, he takes that obligation extremely",2547.578,3.103
"seriously, and I -- and so -- hold on, I&amp;#39;m going to",2550.681,2.669
just finish Cecilia&amp;#39;s question since she&amp;#39;s so good,2553.35,3.37
on the second one -- that to make sure that somebody&amp;#39;s,2556.72,3.237
inconvenienced a little.,2559.957,1.835
"People experience this all the time sometimes, going in",2561.825,1.836
and out of TSA.,2563.661,1.434
"We have to wait in lines, too, but we do so to make",2565.095,2.803
sure that we&amp;#39;re getting on a plane to make sure that,2567.898,2.436
"we&amp;#39;re going to a destination, not committing",2570.334,1.568
a nefarious act.,2571.902,1.435
"I think that the safety of our country, the safety of",2573.337,2.135
"our people, is always going to be at the forefront of",2575.472,2.436
"this President&amp;#39;s head, and this is where he wants to go.",2577.908,2.903
"Again, I think that we&amp;#39;ve got to keep all of this into",2580.811,3.103
proportion.,2583.914,1.602
We had 109 people that were temporarily detained.,2585.516,3.837
"They&amp;#39;re all in, but they were temporarily detained to",2589.353,3.437
make sure that the safety of the other 324 million,2592.79,3.203
Americans was put first.,2595.993,2.502
I don&amp;#39;t see how that&amp;#39;s a big problem.,2598.495,1.368
"The Press: Sean, I have a follow up on the extreme",2600.698,0.934
vetting.,2601.632,1.401
Advocacy groups are saying that we already have extreme,2603.033,2.369
vetting; it takes anywhere from 18 to 24 months for,2605.402,3.571
people who are applying for asylum or refugee status to,2608.973,3.636
go through that vetting process.,2612.609,1.435
How do you justify making it even more extreme --,2614.044,2.87
Mr. Spicer: I think that&amp;#39;s what --,2617.982,0.667
The Press: And do you plan to add more countries to,2619.183,1.034
this list since --,2620.217,0.701
Mr. Spicer: It&amp;#39;s a 90-day review period.,2621.785,1.035
The Press: -- some of the 9/11 terrorists --,2623.253,0.601
Mr. Spicer: Yeah.,2624.288,0.701
"It&amp;#39;s a 90-day review period, and if you&amp;#39;ve got other",2624.989,1.167
"countries, please let us know.",2626.156,0.901
"The Press: Saudi Arabia, for instance.",2628.292,0.967
"Mr. Spicer: Again, I understand that.",2630.027,0.867
"It&amp;#39;s interesting, though, that you&amp;#39;re talking about",2630.894,1.035
adding countries when I keep hearing all these questions,2631.929,2.602
"about, &amp;quot;Was it too much and too quick?&amp;quot;",2634.531,1.335
You can&amp;#39;t have it both ways.,2635.866,1.568
You can&amp;#39;t argue that we should add more countries,2637.434,2.202
and yet you didn&amp;#39;t like -- we&amp;#39;re having all these,2639.636,1.802
issues with the first --,2641.438,0.868
The Press: I think the problem is that some of the,2642.306,2.202
countries that have problems with terrorism are not in,2644.508,2.169
the list --,2646.677,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Right, and we&amp;#39;re reviewing the entire process",2647.344,1.869
over this period of time to make sure that we do this right.,2649.213,2.702
But I don&amp;#39;t think you have to look any farther than the,2651.915,1.969
"families of -- that were -- of the Boston Marathon, in",2653.884,3.37
"Atlanta, in San Bernardino, to ask if we can go further.",2657.254,3.47
"There&amp;#39;s obviously steps that we can and should be taking,",2660.724,2.069
and I think the President&amp;#39;s going to continue to do what,2662.793,2.202
he can to make sure that this country is,2664.995,1.435
as safe as possible.,2666.43,2.102
The Press: What about the vetting process?,2668.699,1.968
"The Press: Sean, last night we were told by senior",2670.667,1.302
administration officials that top immigration,2671.969,2.436
staffers on Capitol Hill and other offices were involved,2674.405,2.936
in drafting the executive order.,2677.341,1.702
Mr. Spicer: [affirmative].,2679.476,0.634
The Press: That doesn&amp;#39;t jive with the reporting that we have.,2680.811,1.468
We&amp;#39;re hearing from offices that they weren&amp;#39;t involved.,2682.279,1.301
Can you say which offices --,2683.58,2.002
Mr. Spicer: So you&amp;#39;re talking offices that weren&amp;#39;t,2685.582,1.402
"involved, but --",2686.984,0.667
The Press: We&amp;#39;re talking any offices on Capitol Hill.,2687.651,1.635
"Mr. Spicer: There&amp;#39;s 535 offices, plus territories.",2692.056,0.734
Did you talk to them all?,2692.79,1.234
"The Press: Well, my question for you is which members",2694.792,0.667
were involved.,2695.459,0.934
"Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not under an obligation, just because you",2696.894,0.734
"called one of 535 offices, to tell you which ones we",2697.628,1.435
talked to.,2699.063,0.967
"As was told to you last night, there were staff from",2700.03,3.837
appropriate committees and leadership offices that,2703.867,2.336
were involved.,2706.203,1.435
Yeah?,2707.638,0.467
"The Press: Sean, thank you.",2708.572,0.734
Mr. Spicer: Go ahead.,2710.107,1.134
The Press: Thank you.,2712.042,0.734
"Thank you very much, Sean.",2712.776,0.134
"Two questions, please.",2712.91,1.668
"One, on behalf of the Indian-American community,",2714.578,2.87
they are thanking President Trump for the cabinet level,2717.448,3.603
post of Ambassador Nikki Haley.,2721.051,2.669
Mr. Spicer: Right.,2725.823,0.7
The Press: My question is that under President Trump&amp;#39;s,2727.191,2.836
"administration, do you think India will be a member of",2730.027,3.336
the U.N. Security Council and what changes do you think we can,2733.363,4.472
see at the United Nations?,2737.835,0.734
"Mr. Spicer: Well, obviously, the President&amp;#39;s very pleased",2739.236,2.97
with Ambassador Haley being confirmed and spending her,2742.206,2.869
first week up there in New York.,2745.075,1.335
"She&amp;#39;s going to do a fine job representing us, and I&amp;#39;m not",2746.41,4.571
going to get any further with respect to seats on the,2750.981,1.568
Security Council.,2752.549,0.734
"The Press: And second, my question --",2753.283,1.535
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, of course.",2756.053,0.901
"The Press: Thank you, sir.",2757.721,0.667
"As far as President Trump and Prime Minister Modi,",2758.388,1.135
they&amp;#39;ve spoken three times --,2759.523,1.234
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s right.,2761.158,0.934
The Press: -- since President Trump&amp;#39;s victory to,2762.893,1.568
&amp;quot;make America great again.&amp;quot;,2764.461,2.269
"My question is, both leaders, I understand, are",2766.73,1.869
"on the same vote because thinkings are the same, but",2768.599,3.036
my question that -- how the vote will work out for where,2771.635,3.971
"U.S.-India relations are concerned, and India is",2775.606,3.136
waiting to welcome President Trump.,2778.742,1.735
Mr. Spicer: I appreciate that.,2781.845,1.568
They had a great conversation the other day,2783.413,1.969
and the relationship between the two countries is going,2785.382,2.002
to continue to grow stronger in this country.,2787.384,2.269
Yes?,2789.653,0.667
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",2790.32,1.335
Mr. Spicer: Yeah?,2792.623,0.634
"The Press: First, I wanted to follow up on Zeke&amp;#39;s question.",2793.957,0.801
"My understanding is, the wheels were already in",2794.758,0.934
"motion on this raid over the weekend, but did the",2795.692,1.302
President specifically have to okay it?,2796.994,1.001
"Mr. Spicer: He did, yes. He okayed it.",2797.995,1.868
"The Press: And then, there&amp;#39;s a report in the Independent",2799.863,2.202
in the U.K.,2802.065,0.701
that the President plans to withdraw from the Paris,2802.766,1.568
climate agreement within days.,2804.334,1.902
Can you confirm that or shed any light on it?,2806.236,2.603
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t have anything for you on that.,2808.839,0.701
I&amp;#39;ll have to get back to you.,2809.54,0.567
Yeah?,2810.107,0.767
"The Press: Yes, I have two on immigration.",2811.475,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Okay.,2812.609,1.035
The Press: The first one is that the President always,2814.211,1.068
"says he&amp;#39;s a great counterpuncher, but he",2815.279,2.402
attacked Senator Schumer this morning over fake tears.,2817.681,3.47
"He said it was 95 percent, basically, that he had shed",2821.151,2.603
fake tears over the weekend.,2823.754,1.868
But Senator Schumer did not attack President Trump; he,2825.622,3.037
went after his policy.,2828.659,1.835
Was this gracious of the President?,2830.494,1.768
"Mr. Spicer: Look, I think the President&amp;#39;s tweet speaks",2833.297,1.768
very clearly for itself.,2835.065,1.535
He knows what he&amp;#39;s -- he understands Senator Schumer.,2836.6,2.603
"I think Kellyanne pointed out this morning, you know,",2839.203,2.369
where has Senator Schumer&amp;#39;s tears been for all the other,2841.572,2.202
"problems that are going on in this country, for the",2843.774,2.335
"homeless, for the people throughout New York that are",2846.109,2.036
starving for jobs?,2848.145,0.7
"It&amp;#39;s interesting that in eight years, with all the",2848.845,2.603
stuff that&amp;#39;s going on in this country in terms of,2851.448,1.435
"crime and the economy, I haven&amp;#39;t seen too many tears",2852.883,2.402
come from Senator Schumer.,2855.285,1.402
"So, you know --",2856.687,1.034
The Press: My other question is you said it&amp;#39;s,2857.721,2.87
been 109 people.,2860.591,1.101
Mr. Spicer: Yeah.,2862.259,0.634
The Press: But the Associated Press is,2863.46,1.001
reporting that the congressionally approved,2864.461,2.302
"program by which 300 Iranian Christians, Jews, and",2866.763,5.005
"Baha&amp;#39;is, who are at threat of persecution in that",2871.768,2.736
country and were coming to Austria as a waystation to,2874.504,3.304
"come to the United States, have been blocked from",2877.808,3.103
coming to Austria.,2880.911,0.867
"Mr. Spicer: Right, 109 were detained in the",2882.279,1.601
U.S. temporarily.,2883.88,1.469
The Press: But that&amp;#39;s another 300 who have been,2885.916,1.001
blocked from coming.,2886.917,1.034
Mr. Spicer: Okay.,2888.552,0.701
The Press: So that&amp;#39;s 409.,2889.72,1.001
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, no.",2891.188,0.6
"No, no, that&amp;#39;s not what I said.",2891.788,0.701
"The Press: So, I&amp;#39;m saying there&amp;#39;s an additional 300",2893.19,1.068
people.,2894.258,1.067
Mr. Spicer: I said there were 109 people detained.,2895.926,0.701
"Hold on, let me answer the question.",2896.627,0.834
There were 109 people detained in the United States.,2897.461,1.468
They were processed through in a way to make sure that,2898.929,2.402
they weren&amp;#39;t causing anyone in the United States harm.,2901.331,2.803
They were processed right through the system just as well.,2904.134,2.002
That&amp;#39;s what I said.,2906.136,1.135
That&amp;#39;s exactly what happened.,2907.271,1.001
Scott?,2908.272,0.667
"The Press: Yeah, Sean, what&amp;#39;s your level of concern",2908.939,2.436
about any kickback from some of these countries that are,2911.375,2.302
on that list of seven as far as how relations may work,2913.677,2.836
in the future?,2916.513,1.368
Some people obviously are critical of the fact you,2917.881,2.336
"have countries like -- for example have mentioned,",2920.217,1.668
"Saudi Arabia or Afghanistan, where we have had attacks on",2921.885,2.703
U.S. soil with connections to those countries.,2924.588,2.436
Do you foresee those being added?,2927.024,1.568
Mr. Spicer: Are you asking what is our concern with,2928.592,2.703
their reaction to us?,2931.295,1.067
The Press: Absolutely.,2932.763,0.7
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, look, I think the President&amp;#39;s number",2933.997,0.668
one goal is the protection and safety of the United,2934.665,3.503
States and its people.,2938.168,1.835
If they want to act in a way that&amp;#39;s inconsistent with,2940.003,2.603
"their concerns, then that&amp;#39;s up to them to do as a",2942.606,1.902
"sovereign nation, but it is our duty and it is his duty",2944.508,3.436
to make sure that this country and its people are,2947.944,1.769
protected first and foremost.,2949.713,2.002
"Yes, sir?",2951.715,1.668
"The Press: Sean, the LGBT group The Human Rights",2953.984,2.669
Campaign has issued a statement saying that --,2956.653,2.87
setting rumors that President Trump is about to,2959.523,2.569
sign a religious freedom executive order that would,2962.092,2.302
undermine LGBT rights.,2964.394,1.635
Is the President considering any kind of religious,2966.029,1.435
freedom order?,2967.464,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to get ahead of the executive,2968.131,3.37
orders that we may or may not issue.,2971.501,1.802
"There&amp;#39;s a lot of executive orders, a lot of things that",2973.303,2.169
the President has talked about and will continue to,2975.472,1.969
"fulfill, but we have nothing on that front now.",2977.441,1.401
"The Press: You&amp;#39;re denying it, then?",2978.842,1.335
It&amp;#39;s not true?,2980.177,0.767
"The Press: (inaudible), Sean.",2980.944,0.667
The Press: Any chance of the 90-day ban being,2982.079,1.234
extended indefinitely?,2983.313,0.934
"Mr. Spicer: Right now, it is what it is.",2985.015,1.702
The executive order calls for 90 days to review the,2986.717,2.736
seven countries.,2989.453,1.134
"And again, at the end of that, that&amp;#39;s -- we&amp;#39;ll see",2990.587,3.337
where we go from there.,2993.924,1.101
"But for right now, that&amp;#39;s the goal of this.",2995.025,1.935
"The Press: And then, on the Supreme Court, I don&amp;#39;t",2997.728,1.334
believe you answered this question earlier.,2999.062,2.269
What was the reason that President Trump decided to,3001.331,3.203
move up his announcement from Thursday night to,3004.534,3.47
tomorrow night?,3008.004,0.701
Mr. Spicer: Because he wanted to.,3009.272,1.168
I mean --,3010.44,0.601
"The Press: Was it a way -- you know, flip the script here?",3011.808,1.235
Mr. Spicer: Because he wanted to move it up.,3013.744,1.901
He was ready to go.,3015.645,1.569
"As he mentioned on Friday, he was making his decisions,",3017.214,2.669
"he made the decision, and the President chose to go",3019.883,2.503
"with it, plain and simple.",3022.386,0.967
There&amp;#39;s really nothing more.,3023.353,0.734
Daniel?,3024.087,0.668
The Press: The New York Immigration Coalition claims,3024.755,2.636
that a Syrian refugee with a visa was among the detainees,3027.391,3.503
released from custody at JFK airport.,3030.894,2.002
Why was that individual allowed to enter the,3032.896,1.635
"country, and was it a violation of President",3034.531,2.736
Trump&amp;#39;s executive order?,3037.267,1.401
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think every individual that&amp;#39;s gone",3039.302,1.068
through the process has gone through vetting to make sure,3040.37,1.468
"that they don&amp;#39;t pose a threat to this country, so",3041.838,2.503
the individual must have gone through the system.,3044.341,1.568
"I mean, that&amp;#39;s pretty plain and simple.",3045.909,1.201
The Press: But I thought that you --,3047.611,0.734
Mr. Spicer: Yeah?,3048.812,0.601
The Press: The daily briefings were not on the,3050.013,0.567
"President&amp;#39;s schedule Tuesday, Wednesday, or",3050.58,1.035
Friday of last week.,3051.615,1.234
It&amp;#39;s not on there today either.,3052.849,1.635
Can you confirm that he has not received the daily,3054.484,1.702
briefing on those days?,3056.186,0.767
"Mr. Spicer: No, he gets it every day.",3057.421,0.7
The Press: He gets it -- who does he get it from?,3058.655,0.801
Mr. Spicer: He gets it every day.,3059.956,0.668
I just answered the question.,3060.624,0.6
Kristen?,3061.224,0.634
"The Press: Sean, thanks.",3062.459,0.701
Jihadist groups celebrated news of the travel ban over,3063.16,2.435
"the weekend, indicating that they see it",3065.595,1.502
as a recruiting tool.,3067.097,1.301
Former CIA and NSA director Michael Hayden said that he,3068.398,3.337
believes this travel ban could make,3071.735,1.768
the U.S. less safe.,3073.503,1.402
What do you say to those who argue this travel ban will,3074.905,2.702
make the country less safe?,3077.607,1.268
"Mr. Spicer: Okay, let&amp;#39;s go back and look at what it is:",3079.509,2.67
seven countries that the Obama administration had,3082.179,2.836
already identified needed further travel restrictions.,3085.015,2.736
The Press: But they didn&amp;#39;t issue a ban.,3088.385,0.734
Mr. Spicer: I understand that.,3089.719,1.302
But what I&amp;#39;m saying is that the President recognizes,3091.021,2.402
that it is his duty and obligation to make sure that,3093.423,1.568
"we keep this country safe, and by instituting a process",3094.991,3.637
by which we look at these countries over a 90-day,3098.628,2.469
period and the process by which people can come in and,3101.097,2.937
out of this country to ensure the safety of each,3104.034,2.436
"and every one of us, I think, is something that",3106.47,1.768
makes a heck of a lot of sense.,3108.238,1.501
"I understand, and I think in a lot of cases -- and I say",3109.739,3.37
this respectfully -- that I think some people have not,3113.109,2.603
read what exactly the order says and are reading it,3115.712,3.003
through misguided media reports.,3118.715,2.236
That&amp;#39;s -- when you actually read the report and,3120.951,2.035
"understand the nexus of it and how it&amp;#39;s working, and",3122.986,2.736
"again, look at how it worked -- when you talk about the",3125.722,3.203
"325,000 people, 109 were temporarily inconvenienced",3128.925,4.672
for the safety of us all --,3133.597,1.401
The Press: One of them was a five-year-old from Iran for,3136.867,1.234
five hours being separated from his mother.,3138.101,0.801
"Mr. Spicer: And they were processed through, Kristen.",3139.536,0.767
That&amp;#39;s the process.,3140.303,0.768
I get my -- the point is that you can go through and,3141.071,1.101
"nitpick and say, &amp;quot;Well, this individual is&amp;quot; -- but that&amp;#39;s",3142.172,2.069
why we slow it down a little and to make sure that if,3144.241,2.702
"they are a five-year-old, that maybe they&amp;#39;re with",3146.943,1.869
their parents and they don&amp;#39;t pose a threat.,3148.812,2.803
But to assume that just because of someone&amp;#39;s age or,3151.615,2.035
gender or whatever that they don&amp;#39;t pose a threat would be,3153.65,2.469
misguided and wrong.,3156.119,1.034
The Press: Let me just ask you about the roll-out as,3157.153,1.469
well.,3158.622,0.901
Did Secretary Kelly find out about the executive order as,3159.523,3.57
"it was being signed, and did Secretary Mattis find out",3163.093,2.235
only hours earlier?,3165.328,0.935
"Mr. Spicer: No, I -- look, what I&amp;#39;m going to tell you",3166.83,1.501
"is what has been briefed out previously, which is that",3168.331,1.769
all appropriate agencies and individuals that needed to,3170.1,3.67
be part of the process were.,3173.77,1.535
Everybody was kept in the loop at the level necessary,3175.305,2.035
to make sure that we rolled it out properly.,3177.34,1.335
Vivian?,3178.675,0.667
The Press: Do you want to respond to the former President?,3179.342,1.335
"The Press: On that note, how much -- how well were those",3180.677,3.57
departments briefed?,3184.247,0.734
"I mean, you just said yourself that the President",3184.981,1.869
is willing to act very quickly when he has to to,3186.85,2.536
keep the country safe.,3189.386,1.067
So is there a lesson to be learned from what happened,3190.453,2.503
last week in terms of maybe better preparing the,3192.956,2.903
departments that are relevant (inaudible) the,3195.859,2.002
information necessary?,3197.861,1.201
"Mr. Spicer: I understand the question that you&amp;#39;re asking,",3199.896,1.135
but there&amp;#39;s two things that have to be cleared up.,3201.031,1.535
"One is, if we announced this a lot earlier it would have",3202.566,3.403
given people plenty of time to flood into the country.,3205.969,2.269
It could have done us harm.,3208.238,1.168
That&amp;#39;s not exactly a sound strategy.,3209.406,2.669
Right?,3212.075,0.801
The people that needed to be kept in the loop were kept,3212.876,2.469
in the loop; the people that needed to be briefed were.,3215.345,1.868
"And if you -- again, I think that this is largely overblown.",3217.213,3.404
When you look at the context of how big this was and the,3220.617,4.538
"number of people that caught up, it&amp;#39;s relatively minor as",3225.155,3.203
a percentage of the overall total.,3228.358,2.035
"When you look at how this worked on a Saturday, 109",3230.393,4.305
"people out of 325,000 were slowed down going in.",3234.698,3.036
I truly believe that it is being blown out of,3239.536,1.868
"proportion, the extent to which this actually was for",3241.404,4.838
"what it did, and I think, frankly, government",3246.242,1.702
functioned very well.,3247.944,1.935
We made sure that the people coming in weren&amp;#39;t coming in,3249.879,2.57
to do us harm.,3252.449,1.067
We made sure that the people who said that they went back,3253.516,2.069
to a country that was one of those seven did so without,3255.585,2.669
"any intent to do this country or our people harm,",3258.254,3.571
and they all got in after screening.,3261.825,1.701
The system actually worked really well.,3263.526,1.936
"I mean, that&amp;#39;s the takeaway from this, that the",3265.462,2.102
system worked well.,3267.564,0.867
The country is safer for it.,3268.431,1.702
"The Press: Sean, do you want to respond to the former",3270.133,2.102
President?,3272.235,0.667
The Press: Can you answer how many -- I know you said,3274.104,1.468
109 over the last 24 hours since the executive order.,3275.572,2.936
"How many went through -- since that 24 hours, have",3278.508,4.238
been detained for a number of hours.,3282.746,1.201
Mr. Spicer: To my knowledge -- I can try to get you that,3284.547,1.569
number -- I don&amp;#39;t believe it&amp;#39;s many.,3286.116,1.234
The idea was those were the folks that were basically,3287.35,1.769
caught in transit when the executive order was issued.,3289.119,3.703
"Then it becomes a prospective thing, that",3292.822,1.602
they&amp;#39;re applying through their country.,3294.424,2.603
"Again, it almost should be a minimal amount, if any,",3297.027,2.936
"because that primary, initial wave were the people",3299.963,3.77
that were in transit when the executive order was executed.,3303.733,3.404
The rest of them weren&amp;#39;t allowed to actually enter,3307.137,2.836
back and are going through the process through the,3309.973,3.103
consulate and regular systems.,3313.076,1.735
"So, it is actually a pretty easy way of ensuring that",3314.811,3.437
this system worked well.,3318.248,1.101
Yeah?,3319.349,0.667
The Press: Just to clean up something you said earlier,3320.016,1.402
"in the briefing, you said with respect to the career",3321.418,1.868
diplomats at the State Department who disagreed and,3323.286,2.102
"are signing this cable, that they should get with the",3325.388,2.303
program or they can go.,3327.691,1.234
Mr. Spicer: [affirmative].,3329.459,0.5
The Press: Are you suggesting they should,3330.527,0.7
resign their post in the State department?,3331.227,0.701
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I&amp;#39;m just saying that the President",3332.529,1.268
has a very clear vision -- he&amp;#39;s been clear on it since,3333.797,2.102
"the campaign, he&amp;#39;s been clear on it since taking",3335.899,2.369
office -- that he&amp;#39;s going to put the safety of this,3338.268,1.468
"country first, he&amp;#39;s going to implement things that are in",3339.736,3.036
the best interest of protecting this country,3342.772,1.969
"prospectively, not reactively, and if somebody",3344.741,3.136
"has a problem with that agenda, then they should --",3347.877,3.871
"then, you know, that does call into question whether",3351.748,2.002
or not they should continue in that post or not.,3353.75,2.069
"But the President was elected and I think, again,",3355.819,3.069
look at the polls that have come out so far.,3358.888,2.603
The American people support what the President is doing.,3361.491,2.402
Everyone in here needs to get out of Washington once,3364.327,2.069
in a while and go talk to people throughout America,3366.396,2.169
that are pleased that this President is taking the,3368.565,2.435
steps necessary to protect this country.,3371,3.17
"I do -- look, I know the President appreciates the",3374.17,4.572
"people who serve this nation, and the public",3378.742,3.103
"servants, but at some point, if they have a big problem",3381.845,3.003
with the policies that he&amp;#39;s instituting to keep the,3384.848,1.935
"country safe, then that&amp;#39;s up to them to question whether",3386.783,2.803
or not they want to stay or not.,3389.586,1.368
"But I do think that, again, you&amp;#39;ve got to remember the",3390.954,2.402
goal of what the President&amp;#39;s doing.,3393.356,1.335
David Brody?,3394.691,0.667
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",3396.092,0.768
"What&amp;#39;s the President&amp;#39;s message, Sean, to Senate",3396.86,1.067
Democrats who have clearly signaled their intention to,3397.927,3.137
filibuster his Supreme Court nominee?,3401.064,2.469
What is the President&amp;#39;s thinking on this?,3403.533,1.201
"Mr. Spicer: It&amp;#39;s not just the President&amp;#39;s message, I",3405.268,0.901
think it&amp;#39;s the American people&amp;#39;s message.,3406.169,1.602
They want change; they wanted bold and decisive leadership.,3407.771,2.802
That&amp;#39;s what they voted for in Donald Trump in November.,3410.573,2.57
And I think for Senate Democrats to look at this,3413.143,2.869
opportunity after the election to slow-walk and,3416.012,2.269
play political games with these people who are,3418.281,2.769
