Mr. Spicer: Good afternoon.,0,1.768
I know you&amp;#39;re all looking forward to what promises,1.768,5.005
to be a historic night for the nation and,6.773,3.136
for this President.,9.909,1.368
The President is very excited to make his,11.277,1.769
announcement of the next Associate Justice of the,13.046,2.336
Supreme Court later this evening.,15.382,2.535
According to some polls -- and you know we love polls,17.917,2.336
around here -- for 70 percent of the voter&amp;#39;s,20.253,3.504
President&amp;#39;s choice for Supreme Court was an,23.757,2.168
important factor in their choice at the ballot,25.925,1.836
box in November.,27.761,1.501
For more than 1 in 5 it,29.262,1.802
was the most important factor.,31.064,2.069
"Tonight, he will formally present his nominee to the",33.133,2.269
American people and I can assure you that this,35.402,3.336
individual will make those voters and every,38.738,2.136
"American very, very proud.",40.874,2.302
This particular choice is one that the President,43.176,1.835
takes very seriously.,45.011,1.735
He knows it will impact the course of our,46.746,1.568
country&amp;#39;s jurisprudence for generations to come.,48.314,3.671
"As such, he&amp;#39;s taken careful steps to ensure",51.985,2.803
that this process has,54.788,0.867
both been transparent and inclusive.,55.655,3.57
He has been speaking about the list of individuals,59.225,2.036
"that he may nominate since May of this year, and",61.261,3.336
after consulting with several influential groups,64.597,2.736
released a definitive list of 21 in September,67.333,3.137
pledging that his nominee will solely,70.47,1.401
come from that list.,71.871,1.802
He sought the advice and consent of both,73.673,1.802
republicans and democrat,75.475,1.201
senators throughout this process.,76.676,2.536
The President recognizes the gravity of his choice,79.212,2.302
"to fill the seat left by Justice Scalia, one of the",81.514,3.57
most steadfast protectors of our liberty and,85.084,2.503
devotees of our Constitution that ever,87.587,2.069
graced the bench.,89.656,1.501
Whomever the President selects will be a worthy,91.157,2.503
successor to the brilliant legal mind and,93.66,2.969
Constitutional dedication that -- of Justice Scalia.,96.629,4.505
It&amp;#39;s our intention to start promptly tonight in,101.134,1.935
the East Room at 8:02 p.m.,103.069,1.135
Preset will begin at 6:30.,104.204,2.569
The East Room will be available for live shots,106.773,2.436
approximately 20 minutes following,109.209,1.668
the announcements.,110.877,1.001
And both the briefing room and Pebble Beach outside,111.878,2.936
have extended hours tonight to accommodate,114.814,2.469
any additional journalistic needs.,117.283,2.369
We&amp;#39;ll have further guidance on tonight&amp;#39;s,119.652,1.702
plans as the day evolves.,121.354,2.603
"Moving to the news of the day, I know that Secretary",123.957,2.402
Kelly alongside other DHS officials just recently,126.359,3.003
concluded a briefing on the operational,129.362,2.603
implementation of the,131.965,0.867
President&amp;#39;s executive order.,132.832,1.869
I think it&amp;#39;s pretty clear from the secretary&amp;#39;s press,134.701,1.868
conference that this executive order was,136.569,2.002
enacted with the proper preparation and,138.571,2.403
coordination between the White House and DHS.,140.974,2.836
And that implementation will continue and,143.81,2.803
proceed as planned.,146.613,1.835
We also have a few updates on the leadership of some,148.448,2.202
of our most critical government agencies.,150.65,2.135
"Last night, as you know, the President relieved",152.785,1.602
Sally Yates of her duties as acting attorney general,154.387,2.903
and named Dana Boente as the U.S.,157.29,5.005
Attorney for the U.S.,162.295,0.901
District of Virginia to serve as the acting,163.196,2.536
attorney general until democratic senators,165.732,2.669
finally quit their obstruction and confirm,168.401,1.969
the unquestionably qualified Senator Jess,170.37,2.536
Sessions as our next attorney general.,172.906,2.102
Ms. Yates failed to enforce a legal order,177.31,2.536
approved by the Department of Justice&amp;#39;s Office of,179.846,2.536
Legal Council and designed to protect the citizens of,182.382,3.136
the United States.,185.518,1.502
Calling for tougher vetting individuals --,187.02,1.902
travelers from seven nations is not extreme.,188.922,3.269
It is reasonable and,192.191,1.669
necessary to protect our country.,193.86,2.335
Around 9:00 p.m.,196.195,0.768
"last night, the President signed an affidavit of",196.963,1.902
nomination for Mr. Boente.,198.865,2.269
As one of his first official actions in his,201.134,2.269
new post as acting attorney general he signed,203.403,2.769
a memorandum rescinding Sally Yates&amp;#39; guidance,206.172,2.269
regarding the President&amp;#39;s executive order to ensure,208.441,2.469
it&amp;#39;s full implementation.,210.91,2.302
"Last night, the President also announced the",213.212,1.602
appointment of Thomas Homan as acting director,214.814,2.136
assistant secretary of Homeland Security and,216.95,2.135
director of ICE.,219.085,1.568
"Mr. Homan has a long career at ICE, most",220.653,2.236
recently serving as the executive associate,222.889,2.402
director for enforcement and removal operations.,225.291,3.07
Having a professional in place like this to serve,228.361,2.502
as the acting director is critical to ensuring the,230.863,3.27
efficient administration of the President&amp;#39;s agenda.,234.133,3.304
One other update from a story yesterday -- I hope,237.437,2.269
you all saw the statement that was put out from the,239.706,1.902
Joint Chiefs of Staff where Chairman Dunford,241.608,2.235
noted -- discussed the reorganization of the,243.843,3.036
National Security Council.,246.879,1.168
And he made it clear that he would continue to fully,248.047,2.303
participate in the inner agency process and provide,250.35,2.869
the best possible military advice to the President,253.219,2.536
and members of the NSC.,255.755,1.501
I really hope that that statement closes the book,257.256,2.57
on the misleading narrative.,259.826,1.168
And this should hopefully be the final time that we,260.994,1.668
have to address what was,262.662,1.034
in the national security directive.,263.696,2.002
The family of the President also had a --,265.698,1.702
excuse me -- the President also had a very somber and,267.4,3.036
lengthy conversation with the family of Chief Petty,270.436,2.97
Officer William Ryan Owens.,273.406,2.97
The President offered his sincere condolences to,276.376,2.902
"Officer Owens&amp;#39; wife, his father,",279.278,2.903
and their three children.,282.181,1.602
Chief Owens was on his 12th deployment from,283.783,1.969
what I understand.,285.752,1.935
We could never repay the debt of gratitude that we,287.687,1.868
"owe him, the freedom that he fought for, and the",289.555,4.071
sacrifice that he made as well as the other members,293.626,2.302
of his unit who were injured in this --,295.928,3.237
in this operation.,299.165,2.503
"Today, in the Senate, two of the President&amp;#39;s",301.668,1.868
nominees advance out of the committee.,303.536,3.403
The Energy and national Resources Committee,306.939,1.969
approve the nominations of both Congressman Ryan,308.908,2.035
Zinke as the next interior secretary and the,310.943,2.57
nomination of former Texas governor Rick Perry as the,313.513,2.936
next secretary of energy.,316.449,2.102
Elaine Chao also gratefully received the,318.551,3.67
approval from the full Senate to become the next,322.221,2.136
secretary of transportation.,324.357,1.335
I expect further guidance on her official swearing,325.692,3.136
in to come very soon.,328.828,1.168
The Senate democrats have done everything in their,329.996,2.135
power to slow the work of the Senate while the,332.131,2.202
President continues to take decisive action just,334.333,5.106
like he promised during the thing.,339.439,1.334
So it&amp;#39;s unfortunate that the Senate democrats,340.773,1.936
remain so out of touch with the message that the,342.709,1.901
American people sent this past November.,344.61,2.536
The people want change.,347.146,1.368
President Trump is delivering that change.,348.514,2.136
And the only response from Senate democrats so far is,350.65,2.536
to try to stall the core functions,353.186,2.235
of our government.,355.421,1.302
"I know that I&amp;#39;ve repeated this every day, but",356.723,1.601
"honestly, it&amp;#39;s getting a bit ridiculous.",358.324,1.969
The idea that these highly qualified nominees have,360.293,2.169
the votes for their nomination to be endorsed,362.462,2.168
out of committee and get a full vote are being,364.63,2.203
stalled because democrats are boycotting the,366.833,1.801
committee vote is outrageous.,368.634,2.269
The mere idea that they&amp;#39;re not even showing up to,370.903,2.036
hearings is truly outrageous.,372.939,3.17
So I&amp;#39;d like to give a special shout out to the,376.109,1.668
folks at CSPAN for making sure that all of these,377.777,2.602
embarrassing actions by Senate democrats get the,380.379,2.57
wall-to-wall coverage that they deserve.,382.949,2.636
Voters are going to remember what Senators,385.585,1.601
stood in the way of when President Trump -- by,387.186,2.87
President Trump trying to install his agency and,390.056,1.635
department heads the next time their name,391.691,1.902
is on a ballot.,393.593,1.101
"I don&amp;#39;t mean to sound like a broken record, but the",394.694,1.501
numbers don&amp;#39;t lie.,396.195,1.168
Sixteen of President Trump&amp;#39;s nominees to head,397.363,2.169
major department agencies are still waiting,399.532,2.202
to be confirmed.,401.734,1.201
"At the same time in 2009, President Obama only had",402.935,2.837
seven of these people waiting confirmation.,405.772,2.202
"In 2001, President Bush had all but two.",407.974,3.436
"Moving on, here at the White House this mornings",411.41,2.236
we reiterated the President&amp;#39;s intention to,413.646,2.336
continue to enforce the executive order protecting,415.982,2.302
employees from the Anti LGBTQ Discrimination while,418.284,3.837
working for the federal government or contractors.,422.121,2.503
"Also this morning, the President had a breakfast",424.624,1.801
and listening session with major pharmaceutical,426.425,2.503
company executives in the Roosevelt Room.,428.928,2.803
"Merck, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, Celgene, Amgen, Eli Lily,",431.731,3.437
and the pharma trade group were represented,435.168,2.636
at the meeting.,437.804,0.967
"Chairman Greg Walden, chairman of the House",438.771,2.036
Committee on Energy and Commerce,440.807,1.334
also participated.,442.141,1.468
During the meeting the President commended their,443.609,2.269
"progress in lowering drug prices, but also",445.878,3.404
reiterated his insistence that there&amp;#39;s more,449.282,1.835
work to be done.,451.117,1.301
He promised to continue to reduce the burdensome,452.418,1.835
regulations that raised the cost of doing,454.253,2.236
business in America.,456.489,0.901
He was pleased to hear that the chairman of,457.39,2.068
"Amgen, Robert Bradway, discussed how 1600",459.458,3.371
American jobs will be added by Amgen.,462.829,3.336
This administration will continue to prioritize,466.165,1.902
jobs and make it easier for businesses around this,468.067,3.036
country to hire more Americans.,471.103,2.069
The President had lunch with Mayor Giuliani just a,473.172,2.67
"short time ago, who serves as the CEO of an",475.842,2.435
"international security firm Giuliani Partners,",478.277,2.069
and was tapped by the President to lend his,480.346,1.869
expertise to the administration&amp;#39;s,482.215,2.102
cyber efforts.,484.317,1.167
Mayor Giuliani was asked to initiate this process,485.484,2.67
because of his long and very successful government,488.154,2.235
career in law enforcement and his 15 years in,490.389,2.67
private sector security providing solutions for,493.059,3.069
the challenges that we face in the cyber world.,496.128,3.204
"During the transition, the President announced that",499.332,1.635
he intended to host a series of meetings with,500.967,2.035
senior corporate executives from companies,503.002,2.069
"that are facing challenges such as hacking,",505.071,2.135
"intrusions, disruptions, manipulations, theft of",507.206,2.803
"data and identities, and securing information from",510.009,2.603
technological infrastructures.,512.612,1.868
These are the same challenges facing the,514.48,1.468
"government, that are facing public entities and",515.948,2.136
business and the President believes that solutions to,518.084,3.003
these issues will often,521.087,1.568
come from the private sector.,522.655,1.702
"Following the lunch with Mayor Giuliani, the",524.357,1.635
President will host a listening session with,525.992,2.002
these cyber security,527.994,0.967
experts and Mayor Giuliani.,528.961,2.403
No consensus or advice on the recommendations,531.364,2.102
"revaulting from the group are widely expected, but",533.466,3.57
"we do expect a spirited, wide-ranging discussion",537.036,2.469
regarding the growing cyber security threats,539.505,2.336
that our nation is facing.,541.841,1.668
"Later this afternoon, the President will sign an",543.509,1.702
executive order -- or potentially sign one that,545.211,3.47
the federal government cyber security efforts and,548.681,2.302
give leaders the tools they need to keep the,550.983,1.635
country safe from cyber attacks.,552.618,1.335
The order does three main things -- it secures the,553.953,4.071
federal networks we operate on behalf of the,558.024,1.902
"American people, it&amp;#39;ll work with industry to",559.926,2.235
"protect critical infrastructure, and",562.161,1.902
"maintain our way of life, and it&amp;#39;ll advance the",564.063,2.035
cause of Internet freedom.,566.098,1.702
More information will be available later this,567.8,1.735
"afternoon, but the executive orders -- the",569.535,2.87
executive order is the first step in the,572.405,1.468
President taking the address of new security,573.873,3.37
challenges in the 21st century.,577.243,1.902
The Vice President today participated in the,579.145,1.701
Republican Policy Lunch in the Senate.,580.846,2.336
He&amp;#39;ll hold several meetings with members on,583.182,1.602
"Capitol Hill, the beginning of extensive",584.784,2.068
outreach by our legislative affairs team,586.852,2.103
on the President&amp;#39;s Supreme Court choice.,588.955,2.135
"Tonight, the Vice President will swear in",591.09,1.501
"Elaine Chao, as I mentioned.",592.591,1.235
We&amp;#39;ll have further updates.,593.826,1.235
We expect it to be at 5:00 in the Ceremonial Office,595.061,4.004
across the way in the old Executive Office Building.,599.065,2.402
Secretary Chao is one of the most successful,601.467,1.802
cabinet officials in American history having,603.269,2.703
been the longest tenured secretary of labor since,605.972,2.002
World War II and also serving as the deputy,607.974,2.268
secretary of transportation,610.242,1.669
under George H.W.,611.911,1.101
Bush&amp;#39;s administration.,613.012,0.934
She&amp;#39;s the perfect choice to lead the Department of,613.946,2.369
Transportation into what promises to be a,616.315,2.436
significant period of modernization,618.751,1.868
and improvement.,620.619,1.602
"As I already mentioned, the last thing on our",622.221,1.335
schedule for tonight is the President&amp;#39;s,623.556,1.435
announcement of the next Associate Justice for,624.991,2.302
the Supreme Court.,627.293,1.435
Tomorrow is the kick off for Black History Month,628.728,2.469
and the White House is excited to host a series,631.197,1.902
of events this month in recognition of it.,633.099,2.502
"In particular, the US Post Office will hold a",635.601,2.002
ceremony tomorrow celebrating the official,637.603,2.469
issuance of the Dorothy Height Forever Stamp.,640.072,3.203
Dr. height led the National Council of Negro,643.275,2.57
Women for four decades and is a true pioneer in the,645.845,3.436
civil rights movement.,649.281,1.535
"Finally, a couple of administrative notes.",650.816,1.869
"On Friday, the President will depart from the -- to",652.685,2.235
this White House to the winter White House down at,654.92,2.403
"Mar-a-Lago, where he&amp;#39;ll spend a weekend and be",657.323,2.102
holding meetings.,659.425,1.201
Further guidance on both trips will be coming out,660.626,2.169
throughout the week.,662.795,1.335
And I&amp;#39;m excited to announce that following,664.13,1.835
our announcement of expanding the press,665.965,2.102
briefing room to Skype seats we&amp;#39;ll officially be,668.067,2.469
launching the briefing room tomorrow.,670.536,3.27
The inaugural panelists will be Natalie Herbick,673.806,2.469
"from Fox 8 in Cleveland, Ohio, Lars Larson of the",676.275,3.37
"Lars Larson Show, Jeff Jobe from Jeff -- from",679.645,2.703
"Jobe Publishing in south central Kentucky, and",682.348,3.003
Kimberly Kalunian from WPRI in Rhode Island.,685.351,2.903
I&amp;#39;m not sure how she snuck in there.,688.254,1.902
I look forward to virtually welcoming them,690.156,2.469
to the briefing room.,692.625,0.7
"And with that, some questions.",693.325,1.736
John Roberts?,695.061,0.667
The Press: The removal last night of Ms. Yates,695.728,1.335
from her positions has raised questions as to how,697.063,1.334
this President will deal with dissent in the ranks,698.397,5.005
currently and in the future.,705.971,2.103
Does he see what she said yesterday as a difference,708.074,3.97
of opinion?,712.044,0.667
An act of insubordination?,712.711,1.736
How would he read it and how will he act on similar,714.447,2.702
things in the future?,717.149,0.734
"Mr. Spicer: Well, there&amp;#39;s a big difference, John,",717.883,1.602
between listening and sharing ideas and,719.485,3.236
executing lawful orders.,722.721,1.369
It is the right of every American to express their,724.09,3.603
"idea and opinion and frankly, that&amp;#39;s what",727.693,1.835
you&amp;#39;ve seen the President do today.,729.528,1.335
"We&amp;#39;re talking about leaving, you know, at the",730.863,2.603
2:00 hour him sitting down with cyber experts to get,733.466,2.869
their opinions and ideas on how to protect our,736.335,1.902
critical infrastructures.,738.237,1.902
"But there&amp;#39;s a difference when she, as the acting",740.139,2.336
"attorney general, is not only responsible but",742.475,2.936
required to execute lawful orders and definitely says,745.411,4.771
no as someone who has chosen to,750.182,2.636
lead a department.,752.818,2.136
She was rightfully removed.,754.954,2.269
That is a position of leadership that is given,757.223,3.937
to somebody who is supposed to execute orders,761.16,3.537
that are handed down to them properly of which,764.697,2.169
that executive order was 100 percent done.,766.866,2.602
"Ironically, it went through their offices --",769.468,2.936
the Department of Justice Office of,772.404,1.368
Legal Compliance.,773.772,1.035
So the idea that it went through the entire process,774.807,3.203
of which they were part of and then she chooses not,778.01,2.903
to execute actually is bewildering as,780.913,2.936
well as defiant.,783.849,0.668
"The Press: So sir, can we just follow up on that?",784.517,3.536
So is the President laying down a marker now to all,788.053,3.304
of his cabinet secretaries and all of his other,791.357,1.835
"officials to say, &amp;quot;If I give you a directive and",793.192,2.936
you do not follow it you&amp;#39;re gone.&amp;quot;,796.128,1.835
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think that that kind of comes",797.963,1.902
"with the job, right?",799.865,1.068
If you don&amp;#39;t believe in the President&amp;#39;s agenda --,800.933,3.07
and I think every one of the cabinet members --,804.003,2.602
every one of the appointees understands,806.605,1.502
that they serve at the pleasure of the President.,808.107,1.334
We talked about this at length during the,809.441,1.702
transition.,811.143,1.168
This isn&amp;#39;t about joining the government to execute,812.311,2.236
your ideas or your initiatives.,814.547,2.202
The President was very clear during the campaign,816.749,1.968
whether it was economic security or national,818.717,2.169
security that he has an agenda that he articulated,820.886,2.636
"very, very clearly to the American people.",823.522,2.403
And that -- hold on -- thank you.,825.925,3.103
And that it is his job to lay that vision out and,829.028,2.202
that the people that he appoints and nominates and,831.23,2.536
announces as staff members or cabinet members and,833.766,2.269
agency heads -- their job is to fulfill that.,836.035,2.302
And if they don&amp;#39;t like it then they,838.337,1.902
shouldn&amp;#39;t take the job.,840.239,1.001
But it is the President&amp;#39;s agenda that we are,841.24,2.135
fulfilling here. Trey?,843.375,0.801
The Press: As it relates to the executive order,844.176,2.369
"today, how will the Trump administration ensure the",846.545,2.636
digital privacy of all Americans as the President,849.181,2.302
looks to strengthen U.S.,851.483,1.102
cyber security?,852.585,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Well look, I -- just to be clear on the",853.252,1.935
"executive order, I think one of the things that the",855.187,2.169
President -- the reason the President wants Mayor,857.356,1.935
Giuliani and some of these cyber experts to come in,859.291,2.336
is to get their ideas to make sure that where we&amp;#39;re,861.627,4.338
headed in cyber security is fulfilling the intent,865.965,3.937
that ensures that our critical infrastructures,869.902,2.769
throughout the government and frankly throughout,872.671,1.702
business to the extent that the government can be,874.373,1.802
helpful in that are protected and secured.,876.175,2.869
So I just want to caution what we may or,879.044,2.069
may not do today.,881.113,0.701
I think the President&amp;#39;s got a pretty good idea,881.814,1.835
"where he&amp;#39;s going to go, but I think he wants to",883.649,1.435
hear what Mayor Giuliani and some of these other,885.084,2.135
experts have to say about the steps that we can take,887.219,3.003
in terms of executive action that will help,890.222,2.202
secure further these critical infrastructures. April?,892.424,3.504
"The Press: Sean, I have a couple of question.",895.928,1.935
I want to go back to the issue of this travel ban.,897.863,3.771
"Mr. Spicer: Well, first of all it&amp;#39;s not a travel ban.",901.634,2.602
I think you heard Secretary Kelly.,904.236,1.335
"I apologize, I just want to make sure",905.571,1.368
I get this straight.,906.939,2.469
"I think Secretary Kelly, or one of the other",909.408,2.703
"individuals that got up there from DHS, I think a",912.111,1.835
million people have now come into this country.,913.946,1.968
That&amp;#39;s not a ban.,915.914,1.102
What it is is to make sure that the people who are,917.016,2.469
coming in are vetted properly from seven,919.485,2.068
countries that were identified from the,921.553,1.836
Obama administration.,923.389,0.767
A ban would mean people can&amp;#39;t get in.,924.156,1.935
We&amp;#39;ve clearly seen hundreds of thousands of,926.091,2.57
people come into our country from,928.661,1.901
other countries. Sorry.,930.562,1.135
"The Press: Mind you, I have two questions.",931.697,5.472
"So, with all of this happening, and as you&amp;#39;re",937.169,2.436
"trying to give specifics about what&amp;#39;s happening,",939.605,2.836
what is the concern about the fall out from other,942.441,4.338
countries who are viewing this still in,946.779,3.003
a certain way.,949.782,1.401
Have you looked at the fall out and how to,951.183,1.902
counter it and how to work with these other countries,953.085,2.769
that may be allies or even may not be allies in order,955.854,3.304
to prevent something from happening?,959.158,1.401
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think, April, one of the things",960.559,2.336
that we&amp;#39;re doing is trying to make sure that people,962.895,2.102
understand what actually happened.,964.997,2.035
"You know, I saw reporting today that Secretary Kelly",967.032,2.77
was out of the loop and he was on a plane and flying.,969.802,2.335
"And then it was -- you know, it was reported on",972.137,1.936
one of the networks and major institutions,974.073,2.669
about what happened.,976.742,0.667
"Secretary Kelly comes out and says, &amp;quot;I was briefed",977.409,2.002
"on this time, I was talked on this time, the edits",979.411,1.802
came from my staff.&amp;quot;,981.213,1.502
I don&amp;#39;t know how -- I don&amp;#39;t want to spend each,982.715,2.669
"of these briefings talking about misinformation, but",985.384,2.703
at the end of the day a major newspaper and a,988.087,1.568
major network reported today that they were kept,989.655,5.572
out of the loop.,995.227,1.368
The secretary detailed multiple occasions in,996.595,3.37
which he was briefed on it.,999.965,1.835
His staff made edits to it.,1001.8,2.403
I don&amp;#39;t know how much more -- and so I think part of,1004.203,2.369
what we&amp;#39;re trying to do is make sure that people,1006.572,1.835
"actually understand what happened, what the process",1008.407,3.236
"was, and what the order actually does.",1011.643,1.769
Because when we use words like travel ban that,1013.412,2.803
misrepresents what it is.,1016.215,1.067
It&amp;#39;s seven countries previously identified by,1017.282,3.337
the Obama administration where frankly we don&amp;#39;t get,1020.619,2.503
the information that we need for people coming,1023.122,2.702
into this country.,1025.824,1.135
Because what this isn&amp;#39;t about is,1026.959,1.334
not just the people.,1028.293,1.936
It&amp;#39;s about the information that another,1030.229,1.635
country provides us.,1031.864,1.067
So we work with other countries and they -- we,1032.931,2.77
have systems in place to ensure that when you,1035.701,1.802
travel from our country -- or from their country to,1037.503,2.002
"our country and vice versa, that we are sharing",1039.505,3.47
information about passengers and citizens,1042.975,2.135
that are going out.,1045.11,0.934
"These seven countries in particular, we don&amp;#39;t have",1046.044,2.403
the information that is necessarily required to,1048.447,1.969
make an accurate determination at the time,1050.416,2.135
of entry into our country.,1052.551,2.169
So we are going to make sure that because that,1054.72,2.469
country doesn&amp;#39;t have maybe either the systems in,1057.189,1.868
place or in some cases the willingness to provide us,1059.057,2.937
the information necessary to ensure that the people,1061.994,2.502
that are coming into this country,1064.496,1.435
are properly vetted.,1065.931,1.435
This isn&amp;#39;t about refugees.,1067.366,1.201
It&amp;#39;s about travelers.,1068.567,1.602
And that&amp;#39;s what this is about.,1070.169,0.934
And so part of what we&amp;#39;re doing is frankly making,1071.103,2.402
sure that other countries understand exactly what,1073.505,3.203
"was in the order, how it applies, what it means to",1076.708,3.337
Visas and waivers and all this kind of stuff.,1080.045,2.269
"But for the most part, you&amp;#39;ve seen a lot of panic",1082.314,2.102
"and the people actually stopping, reading the",1084.416,2.036
"order, and realizing, oh, that&amp;#39;s it?",1086.452,2.702
And I think that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;ve tried to make sure,1089.154,2.636
that people have the facts.,1091.79,1.335
The Press: (inaudible),1093.125,0.901
Mr. Spicer: We&amp;#39;re not just doing outreach.,1094.026,2.068
I think we&amp;#39;re doing as many briefings --,1096.094,2.37
Secretary Kelly going out there a little while ago,1098.464,2.202
with the head of both ICE and CBP is trying to make,1100.666,2.569
sure that people understand that the,1103.235,1.802
"process is working correctly, it&amp;#39;s working",1105.037,2.436
"very well, that the government is doing what",1107.473,1.835
it&amp;#39;s supposed to do to protect its people.,1109.308,1.668
And that&amp;#39;s the number one thing that we can do. Yeah?,1110.976,1.635
The Press: I have a second question.,1112.611,1.969
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sorry.,1114.58,1.234
You&amp;#39;re right.,1115.814,0.668
"The Press: Now, the President met with the",1116.482,2.335
pharmaceutical heads.,1118.817,0.668
Mr. Spicer: Yeah.,1119.485,0.834
The Press: When is this meeting scheduled for,1120.319,2.435
Congressman Elijah Cummings and President Trump?,1122.754,1.669
After that call President Trump made --,1124.423,1.902
Mr. Spicer: Right.,1126.325,0.667
My understanding is that Congressman Cummings had,1126.992,1.668
-- he was invited to this meeting.,1128.66,1.368
He had a scheduling conflict and we&amp;#39;re looking,1130.028,1.602
at setting up a back up.,1131.63,0.934
But he was -- he was -- he was invited to,1132.564,2.102
the meeting today.,1134.666,1.035
"He informed us he had a scheduling conflict, and",1135.701,2.202
we&amp;#39;re looking to get it back on the books,1137.903,1.335
as soon as we --,1139.238,0.667
"The Press: One on one, not necessarily --",1139.905,1.335
Mr. Spicer: I expect at this point it&amp;#39;ll be one on one.,1141.24,2.135
"The Press: Thanks a lot, Sean.",1143.375,2.202
Does the President anticipate a difficult,1145.577,2.303
"confirmation fight for his nominee, whoever that is?",1147.88,3.069
Mr. Spicer: No.,1150.949,1.235
I think that we&amp;#39;ve proven so far the democrats can,1152.184,2.903
"try to obstruct, but at the end of the day the",1155.087,2.869
will of the American people is going to,1157.956,1.969
overcome that.,1159.925,0.667
"And if, again, what I mentioned at the outset of",1160.592,1.835
this is the advice and consent piece of this.,1162.427,3.27
He and our team have met with senators from both,1165.697,3.27
sides of the aisle to make sure that we understand,1168.967,2.503
the qualities that they are looking for in the,1171.47,2.402
next associate justice.,1173.872,2.503
"And I think that we have done a very, very good job",1176.375,2.602
of getting a nominee in place -- that will be,1178.977,3.504
announced tonight -- that meets the criteria,1182.481,2.269
they set forth.,1184.75,0.901
They may not like their political or philosophical,1185.651,3.837
background but I think the criteria in terms of,1189.488,1.802
"academia background, time on the bench -- the",1191.29,3.37
expertise in criteria meets the intent of both,1194.66,4.471
republicans and democrats.,1199.131,2.202
John Gizzi?,1201.333,0.667
The Press: Do you believe you can get nine democrats,1202,1.902
to support this nominee?,1203.902,1.168
Mr. Spicer: I do. Absolutely.,1205.07,1.468
Because I think at the end of the day one of the,1206.538,2.736
things that&amp;#39;s been a time honored tradition in this,1209.274,1.669
country is that we recognize that the,1210.943,1.801
confirmation process is -- if you&amp;#39;re -- the default,1212.744,2.002
is if you&amp;#39;re qualified for the position then you,1214.746,5.673
should be confirmed.,1220.419,0.734
Not the other way around.,1221.153,1.334
And I think that most democrats realize that at,1222.487,2.636
some point that is a -- having a court that is not,1225.123,3.771
fully operational is not the way to -- is not the,1228.894,2.636
political fight to have.,1231.53,1.268
John Gizzi.,1232.798,0.667
"The Press: Sean, let me ask you the obvious follow",1233.465,2.136
up question then.,1235.601,0.967
At least one republican senator has said democrats,1236.568,4.872
have removed the filibuster from just about,1241.44,2.936
every other appointment aside from,1244.376,2.302
the Supreme Court.,1246.678,1.035
And he said several republicans say they would,1247.713,3.436
have no hesitation about moving for another nuclear,1251.149,3.471
option if democrats attempt a filibuster of,1254.62,3.003
any of the possible nominees.,1257.623,2.168
Is this something the President would support?,1259.791,3.17
And has he discussed it with members,1262.961,1.702
of the Senate?,1264.663,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I think first and foremost taking the,1265.33,2.036
"last question, I think we&amp;#39;re going to get the",1267.366,2.035
nine senators regardless and I wouldn&amp;#39;t be,1269.401,1.602
surprised if we get more.,1271.003,1.101
When you look at -- and I&amp;#39;ll be able to shed more,1272.104,2.669
light on this tomorrow in terms of the background.,1274.773,2.936
But I think he is -- we&amp;#39;ve got an individual that I,1277.709,3.671
think is hopefully going to garner widespread,1281.38,3.47
bipartisan support because I think this individual,1284.85,2.736
has the qualifications and the experience and the,1287.586,3.47
judicial philosophy that,1291.056,1.902
should win bipartisan support.,1292.958,1.601
"That being said, beyond that I would suggest",1294.559,1.969
Senator McConnell has done a phenomenal job of moving,1296.528,3.203
things along in the Senate to the extent that,1299.731,1.602
democrats will let him.,1301.333,1.101
And I&amp;#39;ll leave any further questions to how the,1302.434,1.635
Senate operates to him. Blake?,1304.069,1.034
The Press: Thanks.,1305.103,1.001
We know that the list of 21 was put out,1306.104,2.836
during the campaign.,1308.94,0.801
We know that at 8:02 tonight the President is,1309.741,2.836
going to reveal his selection.,1312.577,1.602
Can you kind of fill the gap in between as to how,1314.179,3.804
often the President might have spoken with this,1317.983,2.536
"person, whether there were any meetings here at the",1320.519,1.635
White House?,1322.154,0.667
Just any of the how he got there?,1322.821,2.736
"And then the last hours -- or the last days really,",1325.557,2.269
who has he leaned on to kind of narrow this down?,1327.826,3.937
And then a follow up if you don&amp;#39;t mind.,1331.763,2.303
Mr. Spicer: I will say I think I probably should,1334.066,2.002
allot more light on this tomorrow.,1336.068,1.868
I appreciate the effort to try to -- to head that,1337.936,4.238
"off, but tomorrow I think we might be able to have a",1342.174,2.636
little bit more of a discussion as to how the,1344.81,1.935
President came to this choice.,1346.745,1.601
He may tough on it a little tonight.,1348.346,1.469
I&amp;#39;ll leave it to him.,1349.815,2.402
"But, I appreciate that.",1352.217,0.767
The Press: Let me ask you that about news of the day,1352.984,1.402
"-- prescription drug prices, the President met",1354.386,2.402
with the pharma leaders earlier today.,1356.788,2.269
What makes him so confident that he can,1359.057,3.637
drive down drug prices whereas administrations,1362.694,2.669
past have tried to do the,1365.363,1.135
same but haven&amp;#39;t been able to?,1366.498,0.968
How&amp;#39;s he going to go about it?,1367.466,1.134
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think this is the story of his",1368.6,1.802
entire administration.,1370.402,1.234
He&amp;#39;s a successful businessman and a,1371.636,2.103
top-notch negotiator.,1373.739,1.334
Several people tried to,1375.073,0.834
get the cost of planes down.,1375.907,1.602
The cost of the F35 and the cost of the Air Force,1377.509,3.036
One and through a couple,1380.545,1.669
of conversations he did it.,1382.214,1.635
"Shaved billions off of the cost of both -- excuse me,",1383.849,2.969
off of the F35 and significant off the next,1386.818,2.937
generation Air Force One.,1389.755,1.601
I think he has a track record so far just,1391.356,2.002
during the transition.,1393.358,1.301
"But also as a businessman, he knows how to --",1394.659,1.669
how to negotiate.,1396.328,1.568
And I think he&amp;#39;s going to sit down with these,1397.896,1.602
individuals the same way that he&amp;#39;s getting people,1399.498,2.335
to understand the agenda and the regulatory and tax,1401.833,2.736
climate that he wants to institute that&amp;#39;s,1404.569,1.435
bringing jobs home.,1406.004,1.268
People are making a commitment to him to bring,1407.272,2.736
jobs and manufacturing back based on his track,1410.008,2.636
record as a businessman and his word.,1412.644,2.102
They understand that he&amp;#39;s going to create a climate,1414.746,3.103
that supports the American,1417.849,1.802
worker and American manufacturing.,1419.651,1.802
"So, I think, you know -- you look over and over",1421.453,3.27
again at the number of companies that want to,1424.723,2.069
"come back and say, &amp;quot;We want to be part of this",1426.792,1.901
agenda to grow the economy and to create jobs or to,1428.693,3.771
help you fight on behalf of taxpayers.&amp;quot;,1432.464,1.401
And I think you&amp;#39;re going to continue to see that.,1433.865,1.635
"He understands the challenges, the",1435.5,3.203
bureaucracy that&amp;#39;s holding back some of the,1438.703,2.136
negotiating that&amp;#39;s allowing these,1440.839,1.735

"The Press: Yes, thank you, Sean.",1456.788,1.602
The President is meeting with Mayor Giuliani today.,1458.39,2.836
What do you think of the mayor&amp;#39;s claim that the,1461.226,1.902
executive order on the seven countries evolved,1463.128,2.736
from the Muslim ban that the President proposed,1465.864,2.035
during the campaign?,1467.899,0.901
Is that accurate?,1468.8,1.001
Mr. Spicer: I think the President has talked about,1469.801,1.935
extreme vetting and the need to keep America safe,1471.736,3.003
"for a very, very long time.",1474.739,1.268
"At the same time, he&amp;#39;s also made very clear that",1476.007,2.169
this is not a Muslim ban.,1478.176,1.669
It&amp;#39;s not a travel ban.,1479.845,1.501
It&amp;#39;s a vetting system to keep America safe.,1481.346,2.769
That&amp;#39;s it.,1484.115,0.668
Plain and simple.,1484.783,1.101
And all of the facts and a reading of it clearly show,1485.884,3.37
that that&amp;#39;s what it is.,1489.254,0.867
The Press: But Mayor Giuliani stressed that,1490.121,2.203
"too, but he said that it came out of the desire to",1492.324,3.036
have a Muslim ban.,1495.36,0.767
Mr. Spicer: Then you should ask Mayor Giuliani.,1496.127,1.335
That&amp;#39;s his opinion.,1497.462,0.701
I&amp;#39;m just telling you what the President has said and,1498.163,2.436
what the President has done has been to focus on,1500.599,2.235
making sure that we keep the country safe and that,1502.834,2.569
the executive order that,1505.403,0.968
was drafted does just that.,1506.371,1.935
It is to make sure and to ensure that people coming,1508.306,3.137
in from seven countries identified by the Obama,1511.443,3.003
administration that we didn&amp;#39;t have the proper,1514.446,1.735
systems to know who was coming into our country,1516.181,2.569
was put in place and a 90-day period was also,1518.75,2.469
granted to ensure that we knew how to further,1521.219,3.47
address vetting situations in the future. Zeke?,1524.689,2.836

Just following up again about the strike over the,1528.727,2.669
weekend in Yemen.,1531.396,0.901
Can you confirm that the reports of the 8-year-old,1532.297,2.703
daughter of Admiral Anwar al-Awlaki was killed in,1535,2.369
the strike and if you can address sort of the,1537.369,3.003
killing of an American citizen in this -- in this,1540.372,2.969
antiterrorism operation?,1543.341,0.668
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to go any further than,1544.009,2.102
what the Department of Defense has released.,1546.111,2.135
Obviously we recovered a tremendous amount of,1548.246,3.237
information and we killed an estimated 14 members of,1551.483,4.838
Al Qaeda and the AQAP individuals and then we,1556.321,4.871
suffered the loss of life of a service member and,1561.192,2.803
four people were injured.,1563.995,1.135
That&amp;#39;s as far as I&amp;#39;m,1565.13,0.7
willing to go at this time. Kristen?,1565.83,1.335
"The Press: Sean, thanks.",1567.165,1.068
You were saying it&amp;#39;s not a ban.,1568.233,1.301
"This was President Trump&amp;#39;s tweet yesterday, &amp;quot;If the",1569.534,2.669
ban were announced with a one week notice the bad,1572.203,2.069
would rush into our country during that week.&amp;quot;,1574.272,1.368
So he says it&amp;#39;s a ban.,1575.64,1.035
Is it a ban?,1576.675,0.7
Mr. Spicer: He&amp;#39;s using the words that,1577.375,1.635
the media&amp;#39;s using.,1579.01,0.801
"But at the end of the day it can&amp;#39;t -- hold on, hold",1579.811,1.702
"on, hold on.",1581.513,0.667
It can&amp;#39;t be -- it can&amp;#39;t be --,1582.18,1.568
The Press: Those are his words.,1583.748,1.001
The Press: It&amp;#39;s his words.,1584.749,0.834
It&amp;#39;s his tweet.,1585.583,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: Jonathan, thanks, I&amp;#39;ll",1586.251,1.334
let Kristen talk.,1587.585,0.668
It can&amp;#39;t be a ban if you&amp;#39;re letting a million,1588.253,1.368
people in.,1589.621,0.834
"If 325,000 people from another country can come",1590.455,2.469
in that is by nature not a ban.,1592.924,1.802
"The Press: I understand your point, but the",1594.726,3.203
President himself called it a ban.,1597.929,1.335
Mr. Spicer: I understand.,1599.264,0.667
The Press: Is he confused or are you confused?,1599.931,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: No, I&amp;#39;m not confused.",1601.266,1.334
I think that the words that are being used to,1602.6,1.369
describe it are derived from what the media is,1603.969,1.334
calling this.,1605.303,0.668
He has been very clear that it is,1605.971,1.468
extreme vetting.,1607.439,1.234
"The Press: Does it fit into this broader point,",1608.673,1.869
"Sean, which Paul Ryan said today, &amp;quot;I think it&amp;#39;s",1610.542,2.636
regrettable that there was some confusion on the roll,1613.178,2.569
out of this.&amp;quot;,1615.747,0.867
The House Speaker saying that.,1616.614,1.469
What do you say to republicans who argue that,1618.083,2.269
this is part of a broader issue -- the President not,1620.352,2.736
enacting this policy smoothly?,1623.088,1.167
"Mr. Spicer: Well, first of all, I think",1624.255,2.336
we&amp;#39;ve addressed that.,1626.591,0.934
That we would have either telegraphed this days in,1627.525,2.87
advance in which people could have gotten on,1630.395,2.002
planes and come over here which would have,1632.397,2.002
undermined the exact nature of what this sought,1634.399,1.802
to prevent or we could have done it in a way that,1636.201,3.67
inconvenienced some folks for a little while.,1639.871,1.702
The Press: (inaudible),1641.573,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Can I answer the question -- no, no, I",1642.24,1.668
do -- there&amp;#39;s clearly some confusion.,1643.908,1.969
"But I think part of it, your network was one of",1645.877,2.102
the people that just hours ago told people that,1647.979,2.336
General Kelly was unaware of what&amp;#39;s going on.,1650.315,2.436
"And then moments later he gets on air saying,",1652.751,2.402
&amp;quot;Here&amp;#39;s how many times I got briefed.&amp;quot;,1655.153,1.335
"So, I mean, with all due respect, I think you have",1656.488,2.969
been part of the confusion.,1659.457,1.468
You have helped cause this despite,1660.925,2.036
claims to whatever.,1662.961,0.801
You claim that you have sources that tell us.,1663.762,1.868
"General Kelly stands up and says, &amp;quot;This is how",1665.63,2.302
many times I&amp;#39;ve been briefed.,1667.932,1.035
This is how many people were involved.&amp;quot;,1668.967,1.835
"And yet, you were out there for --",1670.802,1.401
The Press: I think that was the New York Times,1672.203,3.037
report that was cited and continues to do so.,1675.24,2.435
"Mr. Spicer: Oh, okay.",1677.675,1.302
So I apologize that NBC News&amp;#39; reporting is based,1678.977,3.27
on the New York Times false reporting.,1682.247,1.334
But at the end of the -- how can it be accurate,1683.581,1.335
"reporting, Glen, if --",1684.916,0.667
The Press: Both things can be true.,1685.583,1.368
It can be true that he saw it twice.,1686.951,1.335
Mr. Spicer: The Secretary of Homeland Security just,1688.286,1.335
stood up and so you&amp;#39;re calling him a liar?,1689.621,1.334
The Press: He didn&amp;#39;t say he saw the specifics --,1690.955,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: Jonathan, I&amp;#39;m talking to Glen.",1692.29,1.335
I&amp;#39;m talking to Glen.,1693.625,0.667
You said that the report in the New York Times said,1694.292,2.002
that he was unaware of the ban.,1696.294,2.035
"The Press: Sean, let me ask you a question.",1698.329,1.335
Mr. Spicer: Hold on.,1699.664,0.667
"No, no, answer the question.",1700.331,0.701
Because you just called --,1701.032,1.702
The Press: You stood at the podium and you,1702.734,1.902
reiterated something you said yesterday about,1704.636,3.136
anyone who doesn&amp;#39;t agree in terms of the career,1707.772,2.036
bureaucracy should hit the road.,1709.808,2.636
I&amp;#39;m paraphrasing.,1712.444,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Of course.,1713.111,1.168
The Press: You had a statement that President,1714.279,2.435
Trump made where he accused the acting,1716.714,1.969
attorney general of betraying her own,1718.683,2.302
department by expressing a counter opinion.,1720.985,1.936
Don&amp;#39;t you think that kind of language has a chilling,1722.921,3.17
affect on the public statements that your,1726.091,1.668
official will make?,1727.759,0.701
"Mr. Spicer: No, I think there&amp;#39;s a big difference.",1728.46,1.868
Think about the process that worked it here.,1730.328,2.636
The Department of Justice&amp;#39;s Office of Legal,1732.964,2.035
"Compliance vetted the executive order, sent it",1734.999,3.003
back to us saying it was completely compliant.,1738.002,2.336
"Then the acting attorney general goes out and says,",1740.338,1.935
&amp;#39;I&amp;#39;m not going to enforce it.&amp;quot;,1742.273,2.703
You tell me how that jives.,1744.976,1.969
"Because at the end of the day, if the acting",1746.945,1.701
attorney general has an office under her,1748.646,2.269
jurisdiction that says that something is legal,1750.915,2.536
"and compliant and then she gets out there and says,",1753.451,3.003
&amp;#39;I&amp;#39;m not going to enforce it.&amp;quot;,1756.454,1.402
That doesn&amp;#39;t sound like an attorney general that is,1757.856,2.469
upholding the duty that she swore to uphold.,1760.325,2.002
The Press: Well --,1762.327,0.667
Mr. Spicer: So -- can I -- at the end of the day then,1762.994,2.803
she should step down.,1765.797,1.435
"But at the end of the day, the attorney general",1767.232,2.469
either had a problem with her own division approving,1769.701,3.136
"something, but it wasn&amp;#39;t the President she had a",1772.837,2.269
problem with.,1775.106,0.667
"The President followed the process, sought feedback,",1775.773,2.803
"went through the interagency review, had",1778.576,2.002
other departments sign off despite the reporting that,1780.578,2.603
said it was otherwise. He got --,1783.181,1.601
The Press: (inaudible),1784.782,0.668
Mr. Spicer: Hold on. Guys --,1785.45,0.734
The Press: Is it a betrayal though?,1786.184,1.335
Is it a betrayal?,1787.519,0.667
That&amp;#39;s a very hard word.,1788.186,0.667
Mr. Spicer: David -- why don&amp;#39;t we just let me,1788.853,1.335
"answer Glen so we can be polite now, huh?",1790.188,1.768
And what the answer is that we went,1791.956,2.136
through the process.,1794.092,1.635
The Office of Legal Compliance came back and,1795.727,1.701
"said, &amp;quot;This is a compliant executive order.",1797.428,1.869
It&amp;#39;s fully legal and it can be executed.&amp;quot;,1799.297,3.136
So then for the attorney general to turn around and,1802.433,1.836
"say, &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;m not going to uphold this lawful",1804.269,3.837
"executive order,&amp;quot; is clearly a dereliction of",1808.106,2.636
duty and she should be removed and she was.,1810.742,2.269
So that -- I mean -- I just -- it is odd to me,1813.011,2.869
that we&amp;#39;re having a discussion about somebody,1815.88,2.102
whose job it is to execute lawful orders who chose,1817.982,3.103
not to do it -- hold on -- who chose not to do it and,1821.085,3.571
then we&amp;#39;re questioning whether or not we were,1824.656,1.468
right to remove her.,1826.124,1.001
That&amp;#39;s the right thing to do.,1827.125,1.101
And if you looked at the folks from the right and,1828.226,2.436
"the left, constitutional scholars this morning,",1830.662,2.068
"they said, &amp;quot;We might not agree with some of the",1832.73,1.469
policies or the political or the party of the,1834.199,3.37
President but he was right to do this.&amp;quot;,1837.569,1.768
He had every right --,1839.337,0.868
"The Press: In other words, why use the word betrayal,",1840.205,1.534
which has --,1841.739,0.668
Mr. Spicer: Because the department&amp;#39;s job,1842.407,1.768
is to execute.,1844.175,0.901
"I mean, they&amp;#39;re the Department of Justice.",1845.076,1.602
And if you have a legally executed order and the,1846.678,3.904
"attorney general says, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not going",1850.582,1.534
to execute it.&amp;quot;,1852.116,1.035
That truly -- that clearly is a betrayal,1853.151,1.935
of what she&amp;#39;s --,1855.086,0.667
The Press: Define the word betrayal.,1855.753,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to define the word, Glen. Yeah?",1857.088,2.035
"The Press: Sean, I think the New York Times Report",1859.123,1.902
said that the secretary did not receive a full,1861.025,2.703
briefing until the executive order,1863.728,2.402
was being signed.,1866.13,1.402
"So my question is can we expect that secretaries,",1867.532,4.271
agency heads -- when there are future executive,1871.803,3.804
orders or changes in policy may not receive,1875.607,3.236
full briefings?,1878.843,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: I -- look, the secretary was briefed on",1879.51,3.17
multiple occasions with the language of the order.,1882.68,2.603
I don&amp;#39;t know how you can,1885.283,1.335
say this any other way. He --,1886.618,1.635
"The Press: I&amp;#39;m talking about full briefing, which",1888.253,3.703
is what the New York Times reported.,1891.956,2.036
"Mr. Spicer: Oh -- well, and I&amp;#39;m telling you that I",1893.992,1.334
don&amp;#39;t believe the New York Times,1895.326,1.335
reporting is accurate.,1896.661,0.667
That what I&amp;#39;m telling you is that the secretary on,1897.328,1.335
multiple occasions was briefed.,1898.663,0.667
His senior officials were briefed.,1899.33,1.335
"Not just briefed, they were part of the",1900.665,1.535
drafting process.,1902.2,1.802
It went through -- not only that -- just back up.,1904.002,1.768
So they get6 consulted and briefed.,1905.77,2.035
It goes through the office of legal compliance.,1907.805,1.669
Then it gets shipped out to the NSC and the,1909.474,2.068
Homeland Security Council.,1911.542,1.368
"This went through a very, very extensive",1912.91,2.169
staffing process.,1915.079,1.502
So the idea that you can -- whether or not he got,1916.581,2.335
fully briefed.,1918.916,1.068
"He was briefed multiple times, saw the language,",1919.984,2.369
"his staff made edits, it came back multiple times.",1922.353,2.736
I&amp;#39;m not sure what -- how,1925.089,1.402
much more briefing you can do. Yes?,1926.491,1.401
The Press: Thank you Sean.,1927.892,1.568
Zoe Daniel from Australian Broadcasting.,1929.46,1.669
Thanks for taking the question.,1931.129,1.668
The Australian government made a recent deal with,1932.797,2.436
the Obama administration whereby the U.S.,1935.233,2.102
would take refugees from Australia&amp;#39;s offshore,1937.335,2.102
detention centers.,1939.437,0.701
"Now most of these people are from Iran, but also",1940.138,3.503
some are from Iraq and,1943.641,1.735
Somalia among other places.,1945.376,1.402
Can you confirm that this deal is still on?,1946.778,3.169
Are those refugees exempt from what you describe as,1949.947,3.137
the extreme vetting?,1953.084,1.268
Or will that deal change or be delayed?,1954.352,1.969
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, so the deal specifically deals",1956.321,2.302
with 1250 people that are mostly in,1958.623,2.869
Papua New Guinea being held.,1961.492,2.036
Those people -- part of the deal is that they have,1963.528,2.302
to be vetted in the same,1965.83,1.735
manner that we&amp;#39;re doing now.,1967.565,1.268
There will be extreme vetting applied,1968.833,1.568
to all of them.,1970.401,1.035
That is part and parcel of the deal that was made.,1971.436,3.103
And it was made by the Obama administration with,1974.539,2.269
the full backing of the United States government.,1976.808,2.569
"The President in accordance with that deal,",1979.377,2.402
to honor what had been agreed upon by the United,1981.779,2.102
"States government, and ensuring that that vetting",1983.881,2.97
will take place in the same manner that we&amp;#39;re,1986.851,2.135
doing it now will go forward. Yeah.,1988.986,1.836
"The Press: Sean, big question -- looking at",1990.822,2.202
a bigger picture.,1993.024,0.834
This President when he came in said he was going,1993.858,2.769
"to gather us all together, that he was going to bring",1996.627,3.07
us together.,1999.697,0.668
And the actions taken in the first 10 days seem to,2000.365,2.936
indicate otherwise from his -- from people in his,2003.301,2.169
own party.,2005.47,0.667
The use of the word betrayal.,2006.137,1.702
How is this President going to address the fact,2007.839,2.035
that people are looking to him to bring people,2009.874,2.936
"together and yet, with his own words, seems to be",2012.81,2.336
driving us apart?,2015.146,0.701
Mr. Spicer: I think that&amp;#39;s a very one-sided way of,2015.847,2.369
looking at this.,2018.216,0.667
"I think he&amp;#39;s brought -- I will, I think he&amp;#39;s brought",2018.883,2.703
"unions together, business leaders together,",2021.586,2.369
"republicans, democrats, independents.",2023.955,2.335
I think someone who doesn&amp;#39;t carry out an act,2026.29,2.77
and using that as a way to describe that he&amp;#39;s not,2029.06,2.636
bringing the country together is not,2031.696,1.368
exactly a representation.,2033.064,1.568
Hold on -- I don&amp;#39;t -- I&amp;#39;m not -- the President has,2034.632,3.237
done a tremendous amount through both what he has,2037.869,2.836
said and done more importantly to start to,2040.705,2.469
bring this country together.,2043.174,0.901
"And his policies, frankly, are focused on keeping",2044.075,2.469
every American safe and getting every American a,2046.544,2.703
higher paying and better paying job.,2049.247,1.868
I think that is something that benefits all of us.,2051.115,2.069
The Press: I had asked you about a shield law for,2053.184,3.704
journalists last week.,2056.888,0.934
You said you would get back with us.,2057.822,1.702
Mr. Spicer: Hold on.,2059.524,1.234
The Press: Real quick on trade -- now that notices,2060.758,3.137
"have been given to the TPP countries, are you",2063.895,2.802
"considering any changes in the roles of your three,",2066.697,2.803
sort of official trade negotiators?,2069.5,1.568
And what are of the globe are you going to start,2071.068,2.937
first on negotiations?,2074.005,1.201
"Mr. Spicer: Well, there&amp;#39;s no change in their roles.",2075.206,2.636
I&amp;#39;m not entirely sure.,2077.842,1.068
I think as of now it&amp;#39;s --,2078.91,1.635
The Press: (inaudible) negotiators --,2080.545,1.334
Mr. Spicer: He is the U.S.,2081.879,0.734
"-- I mean, he&amp;#39;s got to be",2082.613,1.001
"confirmed first, but the U.S.",2083.614,1.735
trade representative is clearly the leader of,2085.349,2.937
negotiating trade deals and Wilbur Ross and Peter,2088.286,2.169
Navarro and Jason Greenblatt.,2090.455,1.434
"There&amp;#39;s a great, unbelievably robust,",2091.889,3.07
brilliant team that has continued to work on,2094.959,2.302
behalf of deals and,2097.261,1.869
renegotiating looking at them.,2099.13,1.234
So it&amp;#39;s a two-step process.,2100.364,1.402
I think number one we&amp;#39;re going to reexamine all of,2101.766,2.035
"the current trade deals, figure out if",2103.801,1.869
we can improve them.,2105.67,2.469
"But secondly, I think we&amp;#39;re going to start",2108.139,1.368
talking to other countries around the globe including,2109.507,3.103
some of those TPP partners.,2112.61,1.468
"I think of the other 11 countries, five of them we",2114.078,3.137
have current trade deals with.,2117.215,1.501
So you would examine those to see if we can improve,2118.716,2.469
upon them and then look at the other countries in,2121.185,1.869
there and see if there&amp;#39;s a willingness to engage with,2123.054,2.235
some of those other countries. Yeah?,2125.289,1.335
"The Press: Sean, the President has previously",2126.624,2.903
indicated that he would encourage the targeting of,2129.527,3.036
families or terror suspects.,2132.563,1.635
Is that still his current position?,2134.198,1.669
Mr. Spicer: When did he say that?,2135.867,1.401
The Press: (inaudible) on Fox.,2137.268,1.935
"He said, &amp;quot;The other thing with terrorists is you",2139.203,1.502
have to take out their families.&amp;quot;,2140.705,1.334
Mr. Spicer: I think he&amp;#39;s -- I think he&amp;#39;s been very,2142.039,1.402
clear that when it comes to seeking out ISIS and,2143.441,3.703
other terrorists that he&amp;#39;s going to lean on Director,2147.144,2.436
"Pompeo, General Mattis, and seek their opinion on",2149.58,1.702
stuff and I think that will be continued. Sarah&amp;gt;,2151.282,1.702
The Press: So the families of terror suspects?,2152.984,1.468
"Civilian families, Sean?",2154.452,1.501
Mr. Spicer: Thank you.,2155.953,1.302
I got it. Yeah?,2157.255,1.268
"The Press: Sean, thanks for taking this question.",2158.523,2.569
I know you indicated at that podium there would be,2161.092,3.203
further action.,2164.295,0.667
What does this look like?,2164.962,1.569
And there are five detainees that have been,2166.531,2.569
cleared for transfer that are sitting at Guantanamo.,2169.1,2.569
Will this administration take action in the next,2171.669,2.569
coming months on those detainees?,2174.238,1.602
Mr. Spicer: I think all of those actions are being,2175.84,2.569
currently reviewed and we don&amp;#39;t have anything,2178.409,2.269
further at this time. Yeah?,2180.678,1.602
"The Press: Hi, Evan (inaudible) with the",2182.28,2.402
Evening News.,2184.682,0.701
Thank you for taking the question.,2185.383,2.068
The Obama administration&amp;#39;s (inaudible) undergirds the,2187.451,2.036
Clean Power Plan.,2189.487,1.034
Does the President still plan to revoke the Clean,2190.521,3.27
Power Plan?,2193.791,0.667
"And would he perhaps, even go further and try and",2194.458,3.471
revoke the endangerment finding?,2197.929,1.601
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think the President has made",2199.53,3.904
very clear with respect to energy policy that he,2203.434,1.368
wants to review all of the options that we have to,2204.802,1.335
use our natural resources to better the country in,2206.137,1.334
"terms of wind, power, solar, clean coal -- we&amp;#39;re",2207.471,1.335
in the process of reviewing all of our,2208.806,1.335
energy policies.,2210.141,0.667
I&amp;#39;d go back to note that we don&amp;#39;t have an energy,2210.808,2.302
secretary confirmed right now because the Senate,2213.11,5.005
hasn&amp;#39;t yet moved forward with that.,2222.153,1.935
I hope that once that&amp;#39;s done we will have further,2224.088,1.869
updates on energy. Matt?,2225.957,0.934
"The Press: Sean, Sally yates was obviously an",2226.891,3.503
Obama appointee that was holding on through,2230.394,2.236
the transition.,2232.63,0.667
How many more of them are there throughout the,2233.297,1.669
government and at this time as the transition and,2234.966,5.705
confirmation process plays out?,2240.671,1.635
And do you expect any more problems from any,2242.306,1.902
of the other ones?,2244.208,1.068
"Mr. Spicer: In some cases, we&amp;#39;ve held some",2245.276,1.902
individuals over because they hold a critical,2247.178,2.702
position within government.,2249.88,1.068
In some cases we&amp;#39;ve named folks as acting.,2250.948,3.637
It&amp;#39;s a case-by-case basis.,2254.585,1.902
"And again, I think part of it right now is the",2256.487,2.369
President wanted to focus on getting his cabinet,2258.856,2.569
up and complete.,2261.425,1.468
We&amp;#39;ll continue to make nominations both at the,2262.893,1.902
"deputy, under, assistant secretary level.",2264.795,3.037
"But in key agencies, so ICE being one of them",2267.832,2.803
where it&amp;#39;s an assistant secretary.,2270.635,1.501
But there are 30 other agencies where we&amp;#39;ve named,2272.136,2.636
acting heads to ensure that as we move through,2274.772,2.302
the confirmation process we have somebody in that,2277.074,4.071
position to ensure continuity of government.,2281.145,3.403
Daniel?,2284.548,0.668
"The Press: Sean, yesterday you said 109 individuals",2285.216,1.902
were affected by this extreme vetting.,2287.118,1.835
DHS officials said that it was over 1100.,2288.953,2.436
"Mr. Spicer: No, no.",2291.389,1.234
Hold on.,2292.623,0.667
"First of all, just to be clear what they&amp;#39;re talking",2293.29,2.169
about is the number of people who weren&amp;#39;t allowed,2295.459,2.369
to board a plane coming in.,2297.828,2.837
"So they were stopped at their port of entry, had",2300.665,3.303
"to get additional clearance,",2303.968,2.569
and then take off.,2306.537,0.734
There&amp;#39;s a big difference.,2307.271,0.667
The numbers that we&amp;#39;re talking about were the,2307.938,1.335
initial group of people that were in transit at,2309.273,2.836
the time the executive order was signed.,2312.109,1.535
And then there&amp;#39;s another group of people and the,2313.644,2.202
Department of Homeland Security has those numbers,2315.846,2.603
up to date on their website where they&amp;#39;re,2318.449,2.603
talking about people who were stopped at the port,2321.052,1.701
of entry to ensure that they&amp;#39;re properly vetted,2322.753,2.403
before they board a plane.,2325.156,1.201
"Because there&amp;#39;s a very, very delicate distinction",2326.357,2.836
between people who were on the plane coming into this,2329.193,3.437
"country when the executive order was signed, all of",2332.63,2.269
who&amp;#39;ve been vetted and cleared -- and the people,2334.899,1.935
who have been stopped at a port of entry in one of,2336.834,2.269
those seven countries to ensure that the proper,2339.103,2.302
vetting took place before,2341.405,1.769
they were able to move on. Yeah?,2343.174,1.334
"The Press: Yeah, Sean, Hallie&amp;#39;s question was",2344.508,2.336
about civilians that are being targeted by the,2346.844,2.669
administration in anti-terror raids.,2349.513,1.335
Mr. Spicer: Right.,2350.848,0.667
The Press: And Zeke&amp;#39;s question was about,2351.515,1.602
al-Awlaki&amp;#39;s daughter.,2353.117,1.101
So let me ask you -- is the President willing to,2354.218,3.136
"kill and target American citizens -- even minors,",2357.354,3.17
just because their family members are terrorists?,2360.524,2.169
Mr. Spicer: No American,2362.693,1.335
citizen will ever be targeted. Yeah?,2364.028,1.468
The Press: One more follow up there.,2365.496,1.568
"If you&amp;#39;re qualified for the position, you said",2367.064,2.836
"earlier, if you&amp;#39;re qualified for the position",2369.9,1.802
you should get confirmed.,2371.702,2.536
That&amp;#39;s not how Merrick Garland was treated in the,2374.238,3.237
"previous administration, was it?",2377.475,1.334
"Mr. Spicer: No, there&amp;#39;s never been a situation in",2378.809,1.669
"which you had a fourth term, someone that late in",2380.478,2.235
an election cycle.,2382.713,0.901
That had never occurred before.,2383.614,1.835
And I think the Senate republicans were very,2385.449,2.169
clear that we should wait and let the voters have a,2387.618,2.102
choice and that&amp;#39;s exactly what happened.,2389.72,1.869
"As I noted at the beginning of this, 70",2391.589,2.068
percent of people thought that the President&amp;#39;s,2393.657,2.169
choice for the next Supreme Court was,2395.826,1.936
a major decision.,2397.762,1.134
That was something he campaigned on.,2398.896,1.735
I think when you&amp;#39;re that late in a term it had,2400.631,2.369
never happened before.,2403,1.802
And the goal was to make sure that the voters had a,2404.802,2.703
say in allowing that to happen.,2407.505,1.468
And I think that clearly it worked.,2408.973,1.902
"The voters looked at that as a major reason, which",2410.875,2.969
they voted for the President.,2413.844,1.101
And I think that as we move forward that&amp;#39;s why,2414.945,2.369
we&amp;#39;re going to get the support that we need. Yeah?,2417.314,1.802
"The Press: Sean, Sean.",2419.116,1.301
"If the President does get his pick on the bench,",2420.417,3.771
what are any specific cases that the,2424.188,2.502
administration hopes that the court takes up in the,2426.69,3.337
near future?,2430.027,0.768
"Mr. Spicer: Well, there&amp;#39;s a lot of cases that I",2430.795,2.569
think are in the queue that have the,2433.364,1.401
potential to be 4-4.,2434.765,1.468
I think the idea is to get this individual confirmed,2436.233,2.77
as soon as possible just to get the docket moving.,2439.003,3.503
That&amp;#39;s probably the,2442.506,0.668
biggest priority right now.,2443.174,1.368
Thank you guys very much.,2444.542,1.034
Have a great day.,2445.576,1.168
I&amp;#39;ll see you tonight.,2446.744,1.001
"Good luck, 8:00 p.m.",2447.745,1.068
