decisions solely on the law -- he believes --,125.024,1.335
"sorry, I don&amp;#39;t want to screw that one up -- that",126.359,1.335
his decisions should be based solely on the law,127.694,1.368
"and the Constitution, not on their own policies,",129.062,4.971
preferences or personal feelings.,136.135,1.635

"Clearly, this Administration has made",395.094,2.202
"reaching out to Congress a top priority, but you know",397.296,4.605
where I&amp;#39;m going with that.,401.901,1.635
Democrats in the Senate continue to use every tool,403.536,2.236
at their disposal to try to get a way of the,405.772,2.068
President&amp;#39;s attempts to make the country -- to,407.84,1.835

resorting to these childish tactics.,429.962,2.603
The President&amp;#39;s cabinet nominees will be confirmed,432.565,2.302

Executive Order protecting the nation from foreign,502.869,2.936
terrorist entry.,505.805,1.234
I want to draw your attention to some polls,507.039,1.669
that have come out on that subject.,508.708,1.801
For all the hysteria around the implementation,510.509,2.136
"of this order, the American people as a whole",512.645,2.369
are very supportive of the action that the,515.014,1.568
President is taking.,516.582,1.535
A new Rasmussen report poll finds that 57,518.117,3.237

"voters favor a temporary ban from Syria, Iraq,",524.29,3.303
"Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen until the",527.593,3.971
government can do a better job of keeping these,531.564,1.902
individuals out who pose a threat.,533.466,2.536
A Reuters poll found that 66 percent of Americans,536.002,2.602
believe that the United States should limit the,538.604,2.569
number of refugees into the country and the safety,541.173,3.237
of the American people and the security of American,544.41,2.002
homeland are the President&amp;#39;s top priority,546.412,2.803

taking to keep our country safe.,551.117,2.369

"restrictions are not based on religion, but on the",563.296,2.469
&amp;quot;structural problems faced by these nations.&amp;quot; I know,565.765,3.47
that there is a question on Monday regarding Iran&amp;#39;s,569.235,2.202

Mr. Spicer: General Flynn.,581.38,2.536
"General Flynn: Good afternoon, everyone.",583.916,3.27
Recent Iranian actions involving a provocative,587.186,3.27
ballistic launch and an attack against a Saudi,590.456,2.636
naval vessel conducted by Iran supported hoothi,593.092,2.87
militants underscore what should have been clear to,595.962,2.435
the international community all along Iran&amp;#39;s,598.397,2.97
destabilizing behavior,601.367,1.268
across the entire Middle East.,602.635,2.035
The recent ballistic launch is also,604.67,2.002
in defiance of U.N.,606.672,1.201
"Security Council Resolution 2231, which",607.873,3.904
calls upon Iran not to undertake any activity,611.777,3.437
related to ballistic missiles designed to be,615.214,2.002
"capable of delivering nuclear weapons, including",617.216,2.97
launches using such ballistic technology.,620.186,3.27
These are just the latest of a series of incidents,623.456,2.269
in the past six months in which hoothi forces that,625.725,3.803
"Iran has trained and armed, have struck Emirati",629.528,2.77
and Saudi vessels and threatened United States,632.298,2.936
and Allied vessels transiting the Red Sea.,635.234,2.703
"In these and other similar activities, Iran continues",637.937,3.437
to threaten U.S.,641.374,0.934
friends and allies in the region.,642.308,2.235
The Obama Administration failed to respond,644.543,2.67
"adequately to Tehran&amp;#39;s malign actions, including",647.213,3.103
"weapons transfers, support for terrorism, and other",650.316,3.203
violations of international norms.,653.519,2.336
The Trump Administration condemns such actions by,655.855,2.636
"Iran that undermine security, prosperity and",658.491,2.903
stability throughout and beyond the Middle East and,661.394,3.169
place -- which places American lives at risk.,664.563,3.27
President Trump has severely criticized the,667.833,1.936
various agreements reached between Iran and the Obama,669.769,3.67
"Administration, as well as the United Nations as",673.439,2.002
being weak and ineffective.,675.441,2.035
Instead of being thankful to the United States in,677.476,2.069
"these agreements, Iran is now feeling emboldened.",679.545,3.17
"As of today, we are",682.715,1.234
officially putting Iran on notice.,683.949,1.769
Thank you.,685.718,1.702
"Mr. Spicer: Thanks, General.",687.42,2.235
We are going to have a background briefing with,689.655,2.903
"NSA staff -- NSC staff, rather, today at 4:00 here",692.558,3.704
in the briefing room.,696.262,1.601
Further details will be provided on that subject.,697.863,3.137
"So, thank you, General with that.",701,2.235
"As we start off, I mentioned yesterday, I&amp;#39;m",703.235,2.369
pleased that we&amp;#39;ve expanded the briefing room,705.604,2.002
"at least virtually, and so with that, as I begin to",707.606,3.737
"take your questions, I&amp;#39;m pleased to offer the first",711.343,2.436
ever Skype-seat question in the White House,713.779,2.503
briefing room to Kim Kalunian from WPRI in,716.282,2.869
Rhode Island. Kim?,719.151,1.869
The Press: Thank you.,721.02,0.667
Good afternoon.,721.687,0.667
Can you hear me okay?,722.354,0.801
Mr. Spicer: We can.,723.155,0.701
The Press: Great.,723.856,2.202
"Just this week, the mayor of Providence, Rhode",726.058,2.136
Island began calling our capital city a,728.194,2.569
sanctuary city.,730.763,1.234
"As we know, President Trump&amp;#39;s Executive Order",731.997,2.236
says the White House will begin publicizing a weekly,734.233,2.736
list of these municipalities and pledges,736.969,2.903
to withdraw federal grant money from them.,739.872,2.302
"What I&amp;#39;m wondering is, how soon can we expect to see",742.174,3.17
this list and how soon should cities like,745.344,2.269
Providence expect to see their federal funding cut?,747.613,2.536
"Mr. Spicer: Thanks, Kim.",750.149,3.303
I think the President&amp;#39;s goal in ending sanctuary,753.452,2.302
cities is pretty clear.,755.754,2.236
"We want to, as we mentioned with these",757.99,1.435
"others actions, keep America safe.",759.425,2.202
"The goal is to make sure on two fronts: one, we are",761.627,2.402
"doing everything we can to protect American citizens,",764.029,2.87
institutions and ending sanctuary cities is one of,766.899,3.837
the way in which we continue to do that.,770.736,2.102
"Furthermore, the President&amp;#39;s been very",772.838,1.835
clear through his Executive Order that,774.673,2.169
federal funds paid for by hard working taxpayers,776.842,2.936
should not be used to help fund sanctuary cities.,779.778,3.037
As we continue to implement this Executive,782.815,1.802
"Order and fulfill the pledge that he made, we&amp;#39;ll",784.617,2.602
have further updates on how we intend to -- how,787.219,2.136
"that list will come out and when it come out, so I",789.355,2.869
look forward to following up on that as well.,792.224,2.069
"With that, David Jackson.",794.293,1.401
"The Press: David is not here, but I&amp;#39;ll ask",795.694,4.472
a question.,800.166,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Go for it.,800.833,2.336
(laughter),803.169,0.667
The Press: (inaudible) Skype.,803.836,1.735
(laughter),805.571,0.667
The Press: The President&amp;#39;s daily briefing has been --,806.238,3.637
remained of daily intelligence briefing.,809.875,1.735
Can you tell me how that differs at all,811.61,1.869
from the PDB?,813.479,1.034
Is the President receiving his intelligence briefing,814.513,1.535
in writing or orally and who is giving it to him?,816.048,2.402
Mr. Spicer: He did receive an intelligence briefing,818.45,1.936
today with Congressman -- or Director,820.386,1.768
Pompeii was here.,822.154,2.169
"General Flynn, his National Security Advisor",824.323,3.103
"-- his briefer, so he receives an intelligence",827.426,3.17
briefing and the PBD every day.,830.596,1.368
The Press: Is there any sense that we should get,831.964,1.902
out of the renaming from the PDB?,833.866,1.668
Mr. Spicer: I think that it is a more comprehensive,835.534,2.403
"-- I think, again, we went through this during the",837.937,1.968
"transition period, right.",839.905,1.335
There is a difference between the raw,841.24,1.335
intelligence and the analysis and I think he is,842.575,2.602
constantly updated by his National Security team and,845.177,2.77
"other intelligence officials, but every",847.947,2.135
"single day, he does receive the PDB.",850.082,2.369
"And the -- and then I think on top of that, he&amp;#39;s",852.451,1.869
receiving intelligence briefings from his team.,854.32,2.569
The Press: But the oral briefing does not,856.889,2.002
necessarily happen every day?,858.891,1.068
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I can get back to you on that.",859.959,2.135
He does get the PDB every day and on a regular -- on,862.094,2.503
a daily basis meets,864.597,1.601
"with his intelligence team, yes. Hunter?",866.198,1.535
The Press: Two quick questions on --,867.733,1.635
Mr. Spicer: We&amp;#39;re not going to do this again.,869.368,2.069
The Press: On Black History Month.,871.437,1.368
Mr. Spicer: Yeah.,872.805,0.7
The Press: Is President Obama being invited to any,873.505,2.069
of the Black History Month celebrations?,875.574,1.402
Mr. Spicer: Not that I&amp;#39;m aware of.,876.976,1.401
It&amp;#39;s day one.,878.377,1.201
We just started it off.,879.578,1.101
We&amp;#39;ll have to get back to you on further details.,880.679,2.169
I think --,882.848,0.667
The Press: A second one if I may?,883.515,1.368
Mr. Spicer: I think we have a lot -- there&amp;#39;s a,884.883,2.036
lot of activity since I mentioned that the,886.919,1.335
President is going to do to celebrate and honor,888.254,2.502
"this month, and this was just the first day of the",890.756,3.403
month of February.,894.159,0.801
"The Press: Today, he made the comment about",894.96,2.169
Frederick Douglass being recognized more and more.,897.129,1.869
"Do you have any idea what specifically, he was",898.998,2.269
referring to?,901.267,0.7
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think there&amp;#39;s contribution.",901.967,2.102
I think he wants to highlight the,904.069,1.335
contributions that he has made and I think that,905.404,2.469
through a lot of the actions and statements,907.873,2.569
"that he&amp;#39;s going to make, I think the contributions of",910.442,1.936
Frederick Douglass will,912.378,0.734
become more and more. Kristin?,913.112,1.768
The Press: Thank you.,914.88,1.135
"Very quickly, can you clarify what was meant by,",916.015,3.837
&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re putting Iran on notice?&amp;quot;,919.852,1.201
"Mr. Spicer: Well, as I mentioned, I think General",921.053,2.302
Flynn and the NSC staff will have a,923.355,2.036
briefing at 4:00.,925.391,0.834
They can go forward on the -- I&amp;#39;m not going to get --,926.225,2.069
I think we wanted to make very clear that we felt as,928.294,2.535
though that -- their actions were both,930.829,3.037
provocative and a violation and making sure,933.866,3.236
that they understood that we weren&amp;#39;t going to sit by,937.102,2.002
and not act on those actions.,939.104,3.771
The Press: Are you building the case on --?,942.875,1.768
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m just -- I&amp;#39;m not going to go any,944.643,2.169
further than that Kristin.,946.812,0.834
"No, no.",947.646,0.668
The Press: Let me ask you about -- let me just ask,948.314,2.235
you about the confirmation hearings.,950.549,1.335
Mr. Spicer: Okay.,951.884,0.667
The Press: How does the President plan to get,952.551,1.502
Chuck Schumer on board with his pick for the,954.053,1.868
"Supreme Court, Neal Gorsuch, when he has",955.921,1.435
referred to him as a clown and accused him,957.356,2.469
of fake tears?,959.825,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think those are two things.",960.492,1.902
I think we&amp;#39;re going -- you look at the support that&amp;#39;s,962.394,2.102
already come out.,964.496,1.068
I think there&amp;#39;s eight senators already that have,965.564,2.269
talked about the need to have a vote and,967.833,1.935
his qualifications.,969.768,0.868
"And not just the Senate, but I mean, you look at",970.636,1.468
the widespread support that came out for Judge,972.104,2.569
Gorsuch last night across the spectrum.,974.673,2.803
No matter your philosophical view of the,977.476,2.035
"court, I think his qualifications for the",979.511,2.002
court; his academic background make him an,981.513,3.504
unbelievably highly qualified person and so,985.017,2.202
"it&amp;#39;s not just Chuck Schumer, I think the rest",987.219,1.935
of the Senate as he goes up there.,989.154,1.969
But I think the interesting --,991.123,1.001
The Press: Chuck Schumer --,992.124,1.201
"Mr. Spicer: Hold on, hold on.",993.325,0.667
The Press: (inaudible),993.992,0.668
Mr. Spicer: Hold on.,994.66,0.667
I understand that and I think Chuck Schumer has,995.327,1.368
shown time and time again through this confirmation,996.695,1.969
process with the Cabinet that he&amp;#39;s more interested,998.664,2.202
in politics than actually,1000.866,1.535
moving the government along.,1002.401,1.034
And I think that&amp;#39;s -- that is troubling.,1003.435,1.635
I would ask you that I think the question needs,1005.07,2.036
"to be asked to Chuck Schumer, &amp;quot;Why are you",1007.106,2.002
stalling all of these nominees?,1009.108,1.801
What are you insisting on new requirements that you,1010.909,1.969
didn&amp;#39;t assume for Sotomayer Kagan?&amp;quot;,1012.878,2.202
"I mean, there&amp;#39;s a point at which they need to get",1015.08,2.069
"asked, why are they obstructing government at",1017.149,2.336
every step of the way.,1019.485,1.101
There&amp;#39;s an element to which they need to be held,1020.586,2.536
accountable as well.,1023.122,0.734
They held certain standards in place for,1023.856,2.269
"their nominees, both for the Bench and for the",1026.125,2.636
"Cabinet and the question is, &amp;quot;Are they going to",1028.761,2.135
live up to the same standards that imposed on,1030.896,2.87
Republicans when they had nominees in a,1033.766,2.402
Democratic White House?&amp;quot;,1036.168,1.068
The Press: But does the President think that by,1037.236,4.271
personally insulting Chuck,1041.507,1.835
Schumer in that sort of way --,1043.342,0.7
"Mr. Spicer: But again, Kristin, I think the goal --",1044.042,1.335
The Press: (inaudible),1045.377,0.667
Mr. Spicer: -- I think the goal --,1046.044,1.335
The Press: (inaudible) members --,1047.379,1.335
Mr. Spicer: -- to get --,1048.714,0.667
The Press: -- when Chuck --,1049.381,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: -- but again, I would go back.",1050.048,1.335
Chuck Schumer is not innocent in this.,1051.383,1.368
There&amp;#39;s a lot of comments that he&amp;#39;s made and a lot,1052.751,1.335
of accusations that he&amp;#39;s thrown out there and a lot,1054.086,1.335
of politics that he&amp;#39;s played.,1055.421,0.667
"At some point, Chuck Schumer needs to be",1056.088,1.335
held accountable for his,1057.423,0.667
actions and his words. Blake.,1058.09,1.735
The Press: (inaudible) built the possibility on,1059.825,2.169
"the Supreme Court, John, possibility of going the",1061.994,3.003
route of the nuclear option.,1064.997,1.902
"If it gets to that point, is the White House",1066.899,3.77
comfortable with that path?,1070.669,1.502
Mr. Spicer: I think the President made clear his,1072.171,2.969
"goal today, which is number one, he believes",1075.14,2.436
"Judge Gorsuch is unbelievably qualified,",1077.576,2.669
and that he will get nominated and not only,1080.245,2.036
"confirmed, but done so",1082.281,1.401
with a large bipartisan vote.,1083.682,2.202
"As I said at the outset, Republicans looked at the",1085.884,3.003
qualifications of the two justices that got through,1088.887,4.104
in the Obama Administration and while,1092.991,3.237
they may not have agreed with their judicial,1096.228,2.169
"philosophy, definitely agreed that they were",1098.397,2.602
qualified on the merits to be confirmed,1100.999,2.269
and they did so.,1103.268,0.901
I think we would ask that we be held to the same,1104.169,2.169
standard that the Democrats used when they,1106.338,2.302
had nominees up.,1108.64,1.035
But I think the President made very clear that the,1109.675,1.668
decision is something that we would rather not have,1111.343,2.736
"to go down, but also, that it ultimately is up to",1114.079,2.202
Senator McConnell and how,1116.281,0.868
he wants to operate this thing.,1117.149,1.134
John (inaudible).,1118.283,0.668
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",1118.951,1.601
Just one question today.,1120.552,2.069
Ms. Spicer: Yeah.,1122.621,1.401
The Press: Leading up to Judge Gorsuch&amp;#39;s,1124.022,3.27
"announcement last night and him coming out after,",1127.292,3.871
there were still rumors that Judge Hardiman was,1131.163,2.402
"going to be nominated and he, in fact, drove to",1133.565,2.469
Washington --,1136.034,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: No, actually, John.",1136.702,1.168
He didn&amp;#39;t.,1137.87,0.7
That was media -- that was misreporting.,1138.57,2.202
My understanding is that Judge Hardiman never left,1140.772,1.869
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.,1142.641,1.535
"So, with all due respect, I can&amp;#39;t be held",1144.176,2.069
"accountable for mis -- you know, reports that falsely",1146.245,3.703
stated he was here.,1149.948,1.201
He never was at the White House.,1151.149,1.602
My understanding is that he had a meeting in,1152.751,1.668
"Eastern Pennsylvania with another judge, but it was",1154.419,3.07
"-- my -- and again, I&amp;#39;m not -- I don&amp;#39;t track where",1157.489,2.503
"his whereabouts, but my understanding is that he",1159.992,1.968
never left the Commonwealth of,1161.96,0.868
"Pennsylvania yesterday, so it was, you know, we",1162.828,3.303
announced when we were going to make this,1166.131,2.002
announcement.,1168.133,0.901
I think it was a phenomenal way to,1169.034,1.768
introduce Judge Gorsuch to the American people and to,1170.802,3.304
the United States Senate.,1174.106,1.101
"We invited Democratic leaders, Democratic",1175.207,3.07
leaders -- members of the judiciary committee.,1178.277,2.802
"Unfortunately, none of them showed up.",1181.079,1.335
But it was an opportunity for them and the American,1182.414,3.27
people to see an amazing choice that the President,1185.684,2.169
made for the Bench (inaudible).,1187.853,1.201
"The Press: Sean, my question is --",1189.054,2.135
"Mr. Spicer: You said one, John.",1191.189,1.602
(laughter),1192.791,0.667
The Press: (inaudible) asked the question.,1193.458,1.435
"My question is simply this, with the support",1194.893,3.137
"that he received, the people called the",1198.03,1.535
"President, would it be safe to say that Judge",1199.565,3.269
Hardiman will be on deck if there is another,1202.834,2.67
vacancy soon?,1205.504,0.901
"Say, Justice Kennedy retiring by the end",1206.405,2.736
of the term?,1209.141,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think there&amp;#39;s a lot of vacancies",1209.808,1.568
that we see at the appellate level and,1211.376,1.835
throughout the government.,1213.211,1.402
"He&amp;#39;s an impressive, impressive jurist.",1214.613,3.103
"Obviously, the four that really made that final",1217.716,2.703
list for the President were unbelievably,1220.419,2.736
impressive.,1223.155,1.301
"So, I don&amp;#39;t want to get in front of the President.",1224.456,2.102
"Hopefully, you know, he continues to have the",1226.558,3.303
President&amp;#39;s support and someone the President was,1229.861,2.103
unbelievably impressed with.,1231.964,1.434
So we&amp;#39;ll have to see what vacancies come with down,1233.398,2.369
the pike. Anita?,1235.767,0.835
The Press: I know you love when we say we have two,1236.602,2.535
questions.,1239.137,0.668
I do have two quick questions about something,1239.805,1.701
you mentioned at the top.,1241.506,1.802
"First, you mentioned the three folks that are being",1243.308,2.202
nominated to the Department of Justice.,1245.51,1.335
Mr. Spicer: Right.,1246.845,0.667
The Press: Why are they being nominated now before,1247.512,1.802
Senator Sessions is there?,1249.314,1.235
Is it because there is a lack of people?,1250.549,2.769
Was he consulted?,1253.318,0.668
Or is it just because of the whole issue this week,1253.986,2.435
with the acting attorney general?,1256.421,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: It&amp;#39;s just a - I mean, it&amp;#39;s the normal",1257.756,1.969
process of getting those -- I&amp;#39;ve mentioned it in a,1259.725,2.636
"few briefings that the deputies, the unders, and",1262.361,2.402
the actings are in the pipeline.,1264.763,1.335
This is -- we announced one the other day,1266.098,2.168
for homeland.,1268.266,0.668
We&amp;#39;ve got the commerce is previously announced and,1268.934,1.968
so this is just a continuation of the,1270.902,2.103
process to fill --,1273.005,1.067
The Press: (inaudible) under Sessions.,1274.072,1.335
"I mean, speaking with him and?",1275.407,1.568
"Mr. Spicer: Of course, he was -- these are people",1276.975,2.069
that he&amp;#39;s clearly aware of and supportive of,1279.044,2.202
100 percent. Yeah.,1281.246,0.768
"The Press: And the second question was, you",1282.014,1.568
mentioned tomorrow the meeting with the Harley,1283.582,2.836
Davidson executives.,1286.418,0.701
There&amp;#39;s reporting that he was supposed to go to,1287.119,2.736
Milwaukee tomorrow or he was supposed to.,1289.855,2.202
That was canceled because of the company.,1292.057,2.169
Can you talk about that?,1294.226,1.568
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, I just think -- look, it was",1295.794,2.469
easier for the -- for the executives to come here,1298.263,4.438
considering the week and all of the activity,1302.701,1.868
that&amp;#39;s been going on.,1304.569,0.901
"And we figured the easiest thing to do was, again, no",1305.47,3.237
decision had been made about or announced as to,1308.707,1.902
what we were doing.,1310.609,1.001
"We looked at different options and ultimately,",1311.61,1.735
the easiest thing to do in accordance with the,1313.345,1.968
President&amp;#39;s schedule was to invite them here to,1315.313,2.169
Washington to talk about some of the stuff that,1317.482,1.936
we&amp;#39;ve been doing.,1319.418,0.667
The Press: Are you concerned about,1320.085,1.368
protesting?,1321.453,0.667
Mr. Spicer: We&amp;#39;re not concerned.,1322.12,1.335
I think we&amp;#39;re not concerned about that.,1323.455,1.335
We&amp;#39;re concerned about -- we&amp;#39;re concerned about,1324.79,1.334
"American jobs, moving this economy forward, and we&amp;#39;re",1326.124,3.637
exited to welcome them here to Washington to talk,1329.761,2.67
about the great work that they do and the many of,1332.431,1.735
thousands of people that they employ.,1334.166,1.401
"With that, let me go to the -- I&amp;#39;m going to --",1335.567,1.735
"we&amp;#39;re going to be here a while, guys.",1337.302,1.468
We&amp;#39;re going to the second Skype seat.,1338.77,1.368
Natalie Herbick from Fox,1340.138,1.368
"8 in Cleveland, Ohio. Natalie?",1341.506,1.869
"The Press: Secretary Spicer, thank you so much",1343.375,2.336
for this rare opportunity.,1345.711,1.267
I appreciate it.,1346.978,0.901
I&amp;#39;m learning the ropes now.,1347.879,1.068
"Mr. Spicer: Natalie, you&amp;#39;re coming back.",1348.947,1.468
The Press: I&amp;#39;d like to quickly ask two,1350.415,1.468
questions if I may?,1351.883,1.068
"The first one being, President Trump has been",1352.951,3.67
quick to take action on several issues he&amp;#39;s,1356.621,2.47
addressed along the campaign trail.,1359.091,1.368
"And with that in mind, he made a stop here in",1360.459,2.469
"Cleveland, and he said that he would like to make",1362.928,2.469
cities like ours the,1365.397,1.468
economic envy of the world.,1366.865,1.969
A bold statement.,1368.834,0.767
"So, our viewers would love to know an example -- a",1369.601,3.237
specific example -- as to how he plans to do this,1372.838,2.369
sooner than later.,1375.207,0.8
"Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s a great question, Natalie.",1376.007,1.535
"I think it&amp;#39;s not just Cleveland, but it&amp;#39;s",1377.542,2.136
Detroit and so many of the other cities around the,1379.678,2.769
country you&amp;#39;ve heard the President talk about the,1382.447,3.003
need to rebuild our inner cities.,1385.45,2.069
We were really impressed,1387.519,1.101
with Cleveland this past July.,1388.62,1.969
We went there for the National Convention.,1390.589,1.968
"The people of Cleveland, their desire, and the",1392.557,2.169
rebound that the city has taken.,1394.726,2.069
And I think that when you go to whether it&amp;#39;s a city,1396.795,1.535
like Cleveland or Detroit through different tax and,1398.33,3.036
regulatory measures there&amp;#39;s a way that we can,1401.366,2.703
continue to bring manufacturing back.,1404.069,1.501
We can continue to bring jobs back.,1405.57,2.169
"And whether it&amp;#39;s, you know, Harley Davidson or",1407.739,1.802
"Carrier, Lockheed, or Boeing, or the GM, Fiat,",1409.541,4.371
Ford -- these companies he continues to talk with,1413.912,2.936
"about how they can bring jobs back, relocate.",1416.848,3.037
"Again, that was another one of the conversations",1419.885,1.668
that he had with the pharmaceutical companies,1421.553,1.468
yesterday -- how can they bring jobs back?,1423.021,2.469
How can we ease regulations to do that?,1425.49,2.136
"So, it&amp;#39;s about making sure that we have an",1427.626,2.669
"environment, Natalie, that allows more cities to",1430.295,4.638
"compete, to grow the manufacturing base, and to",1434.933,2.936
recognize the things that we can do tax wise and,1437.869,4.738
regulatory wise to allow that to flourish.,1442.607,2.736
"Yeah, Cecilia?",1445.343,0.768
The Press: Thank you.,1446.111,1.501
"And Steve Bannon can be heard on recording saying,",1447.612,2.503
"&amp;quot;Islam is a dark religion, not a religion of peace, a",1450.115,3.103
religion of submission.&amp;quot;,1453.218,0.968
Does the President share his Chief Strategist&amp;#39;s,1454.186,2.202
apparent beliefs on Islam?,1456.388,1.268
"Mr. Spicer: No, I think the President&amp;#39;s been very",1457.656,1.868
clear that his number one goal is not to target any,1459.524,3.103
"one religion, but places and areas where we believe",1462.627,4.205
that there is an issue.,1466.832,0.7
That&amp;#39;s what the executive order was all about the,1467.532,1.902
other day -- making sure that areas that we don&amp;#39;t,1469.434,2.169
feel have the proper mechanisms in place to,1471.603,2.436
ensure the security.,1474.039,1.268
That when they travel the United States that we know,1475.307,2.903
they&amp;#39;re coming here for peaceful purposes.,1478.21,1.768
The President&amp;#39;s number one goal has always been to,1479.978,2.269
"focus on the safety of America, not the religion.",1482.247,3.437
He understands that it&amp;#39;s not a religious problem.,1485.684,2.202
It&amp;#39;s a radicalization problem and there&amp;#39;s a big,1487.886,2.436
difference between Islam the religion and radical,1490.322,2.869
Islamic terrorists that come here to seek,1493.191,1.568
to do us harm.,1494.759,0.668
The Press: But nothing about this comment that,1495.427,1.468
the President wants to distance himself from or,1496.895,1.802
even elaborate on?,1498.697,1.134
Mr. Spicer: I just think I made it clear that there&amp;#39;s,1499.831,2.036
a difference between the President&amp;#39;s view. Yeah?,1501.867,1.401
The Press: Thanks.,1503.268,1.335
There have been multiple reports of people landing,1504.603,2.936
Saturday in the U.S.,1507.539,1.034
with valid visas who were denied entry and placed on,1508.573,3.304
flights back out of the country.,1511.877,2.168
"So, that&amp;#39;s in violation of at least five of these",1514.045,3.07
federal judges orders that came down.,1517.115,1.902
Is the White House working to ensure that those,1519.017,2.336
people illegally deported can return to the U.S.?,1521.353,2.802
And are these court orders causing any second,1524.155,2.169
thinking about certain aspects of the order?,1526.324,1.735
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think that we just -- we issued",1528.059,2.236
earlier today some clarification -- an update,1530.295,3.17
from the council&amp;#39;s office that clarifies section 3C,1533.465,4.771
and 3E that legal permanent residents --,1538.236,3.404
"LPRs -- do not -- that the waiver, we no longer",1541.64,3.303
need a waiver.,1544.943,1.401
Initially as the program was lifting off the idea,1546.344,2.87
"was that they would go through, be granted a",1549.214,1.468
waiver of which everyone was issued a,1550.682,1.768
waiver coming in.,1552.45,1.202
"In the sake of efficiency, we have interpreted the",1553.652,3.837
guidance to all of these agencies to both the,1557.489,2.803
"Acting Secretary of State, the Acting Attorney",1560.292,1.935
General and the Secretary of Homeland Security that,1562.227,2.669
the guidance is that all individuals responsible,1564.896,2.77
for the administration implementation of this,1567.666,1.601
order that that does not apply.,1569.267,1.969
They no longer need a waiver because if they are,1571.236,2.769
a legal permanent resident,1574.005,1.168
they won&amp;#39;t need it anymore.,1575.173,1.235
"The Press: Sean, on Glass-Steagall.",1576.408,2.903
"The President, during his campaign said that he",1579.311,3.003
supported reestablishing the Glass-Steagall,1582.314,2.102
"legislation, which would separate the investment",1584.416,2.669
banks form the commercial banks.,1587.085,1.368
There&amp;#39;s legislation on both the House and the,1588.453,2.803
Senate side.,1591.256,0.767
It&amp;#39;s in the Republican program.,1592.023,1.869
"Mr. Mnuchin, when he was queried on the Hill by",1593.892,3.303
"Senator Cantwell, who&amp;#39;s the author of one of the",1597.195,2.636
bills was a little bit more ambiguous,1599.831,2.069
on this issue.,1601.9,1.234
And I wish you could say something on where this,1603.134,2.369
President stands.,1605.503,1.702
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, I mean I think part of the reason",1607.205,1.668
that it&amp;#39;s-- we&amp;#39;ve got to get -- we&amp;#39;ve got to get a,1608.873,1.335
Treasury secretary confirmed.,1610.208,1.735
And I think that when we sit here and get asked,1611.943,2.503
questions about policy and you go department after,1614.446,4.037
"department whether it&amp;#39;s Treasury, you know,",1618.483,2.97
"Energy, EPA -- that -- HHS, HUD, Education.",1621.453,5.505
The list goes on and on and so you ask about,1626.958,3.537
issues and where the President&amp;#39;s agenda is --,1630.495,1.802
"well, the reason that the President nominated these",1632.297,2.069
highly qualified people,1634.366,1.067
was to implement his agenda.,1635.433,2.002
And Senate democrats continue to hold that up.,1637.435,2.002
"And I think when you wreck it, you can&amp;#39;t -- you&amp;#39;re",1639.437,3.003
asking us how we&amp;#39;re going to move forward on an,1642.44,1.835
agenda whether it&amp;#39;s Glass-Steagall or so many,1644.275,1.469
"other issues and at the same time, the Democrats",1645.744,2.669
are holding up the confirmation of these,1648.413,2.102
highly-qualified people.,1650.515,0.901
Until that occurs it makes it a heck of a lot harder.,1651.416,2.703
Major Garrett? Yeah?,1654.119,1.034
The Press: But the President still supports,1655.153,1.802
Glass-Steagall?,1656.955,0.767
Mr. Spicer: The President&amp;#39;s position is,1657.722,1.702
"consistent, yes.",1659.424,0.701
"The Press: Sean, a broad topic I&amp;#39;d like for you to",1660.125,1.334
take on which is dissent within the administration.,1661.459,2.97
And specifically related to the President&amp;#39;s lunch,1664.429,1.835
with Rex Tillerson today.,1666.264,1.101
"More than 1,000 employees at the State Department,",1667.365,2.236
"Foreign Service offices, and others have signed",1669.601,1.968
this dissent cable.,1671.569,0.835
Is it the President&amp;#39;s position that Rex,1672.404,2.102
"Tillerson, when he is confirmed should go",1674.506,1.801
"through the formal process, meet with those",1676.307,2.069
"people, and have a dialog as previous",1678.376,1.769
secretaries of state have?,1680.145,1.434
And is it the President&amp;#39;s point of view that when,1681.579,1.635
"there is dissent, it can be rooted in a",1683.214,2.236
philosophical disagreement that&amp;#39;s not necessarily in,1685.45,3.103
defiance of his orders and that there can be a dialog,1688.553,2.669
and that it can maybe inform him differently,1691.222,2.069
about policy?,1693.291,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Sure, I think -- I think the",1693.958,2.169
President&amp;#39;s always --,1696.127,0.701
The Press: Because you said a couple of days ago,1696.828,2.436
they should get out if --,1699.264,1.201
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, no.",1700.465,0.701
I think there&amp;#39;s a difference.,1701.166,0.667
I think that -- just to be clear on this -- every,1701.833,1.335
American has a right to speak their mind.,1703.168,2.002
That&amp;#39;s one of the amazing beauties of this country.,1705.17,3.27
You have the ability to write what you want,1708.44,1.735
through our First Amendment.,1710.175,1.334
People have a right to speak out and that&amp;#39;s not,1711.509,2.67
hampered.,1714.179,0.667
"But, the point that I was making then is that if you",1714.846,2.169
believe so deeply that the policy is offensive to,1717.015,3.303
"you, you have to understand that the job --",1720.318,2.136
the way o0ur government works is we,1722.454,1.334
elect a President.,1723.788,1.135
That President gets to carry through their agenda,1724.923,2.669
that they set out with the American people during the,1727.592,1.668
campaign.,1729.26,0.668
And they have a right to express it.,1729.928,3.837
"And I think Secretary Tillerson, for those of",1733.765,2.536
"you who have gotten to meet him, has a very open",1736.301,1.501
mind and a desire to meet with people and hear ideas,1737.802,2.102
as does the President as evidenced through what he,1739.904,3.337
did through the transition and what he&amp;#39;s done since,1743.241,3.07
he&amp;#39;s become President.,1746.311,1.101
"He has met with groups, businesses, associations",1747.412,4.838
"-- you know, Republicans, Democrats, Independents",1752.25,2.469
"that have been supportive of him, that have not been",1754.719,1.835
supportive of him.,1756.554,0.734
And I think that he&amp;#39;s going to continue to do,1757.288,1.335
that.,1758.623,0.701
"So, people have a right to speak their mind, but I",1759.324,1.334
think there&amp;#39;s a difference between expressing dissent,1760.658,4.772
and concern and not implementing a lawful,1765.43,3.103
order as the Acting Attorney General,1768.533,1.335
did the other night.,1769.868,0.8
"So, but again, I don&amp;#39;t mean to keep",1770.668,2.136
coming back to this.,1772.804,1.134
But you&amp;#39;re asking what we&amp;#39;ll do when Rex,1773.938,1.468
Tillerson becomes -- and part of the problem right,1775.406,2.036
now is I can&amp;#39;t fully answer your question,1777.442,1.868
because Democrats are holding up and slow,1779.31,2.136
walking this nomination.,1781.446,1.301
"So, to presuppose what Rex Tillerson&amp;#39;s going to do,",1782.747,3.337
"you know, again, I just -- it&amp;#39;s ironic that we&amp;#39;re",1786.084,2.102
being asked what these secretaries will do when,1788.186,1.702
they get into office and the Democrats won&amp;#39;t let,1789.888,3.37
them assume this.,1793.258,0.667
When we all know that the votes are there for them.,1793.925,2.069
The Press: I was just talking about a particular,1795.994,1.668
process that has historically applied in,1797.662,2.202
the State Department.,1799.864,0.668
Mr. Spicer: I understand.,1800.532,0.667
"And I think -- but again, I think for me to",1801.199,1.335
presuppose what Secretary Designee Tillerson is,1802.534,1.534
"going to do prior to him actually getting sworn in,",1804.068,3.537
I don&amp;#39;t -- he probably will.,1807.605,2.169
"I don&amp;#39;t know, but it would be irresponsible of me to",1809.774,2.636
answer a question about what he&amp;#39;s going to do,1812.41,1.735
before he actually becomes sworn in.,1814.145,1.769
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1815.914,1.635
Senate Democrats have been described as bitter over,1817.549,2.702
the manner in which Judge Merrick Garland was,1820.251,2.77
treated when he was nominated for the Supreme,1823.021,2.736
Court.,1825.757,0.7
Do you feel -- does the President feel that that,1826.457,3.104
bitterness is well founded?,1829.561,1.401
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know.,1830.962,1.735
I&amp;#39;m not a Senate Democrat.,1832.697,1.869
I think they have a right to feel the way they do.,1834.566,2.235
I think we&amp;#39;ve explained our position both during,1836.801,3.504
last year when this was going on.,1840.305,2.302
That we felt as though this was up to the voters,1842.607,3.236
to make a decision on.,1845.843,0.835
"And as I pointed out yesterday, so many voters",1846.678,3.503
made up their mind based on who they believed the,1850.181,2.369
candidates would appoint.,1852.55,0.968
Mr. Trump -- then Mr. Trump -- then,1853.518,2.602
"candidate Trump, now President Trump was very",1856.12,2.703
clear about the type of people that he was going,1858.823,1.935
to put forth both first in a list of 10 and then in a,1860.758,3.27
list of 11 additional ones.,1864.028,1.635
"So, I think the American people knew clearly where",1865.663,1.869
he was going to go.,1867.532,1.101
He followed through on that campaign promise.,1868.633,2.536
And I think that when you look at the number of,1871.169,1.435
"people who solely base their vote on that, never",1872.604,3.47
"mind it was -- you know, and then you expand that,",1876.074,1.935
it was pretty clear that that was an important,1878.009,1.802
factor in the election.,1879.811,1.234
"So, I understand it, but I also think that&amp;#39;s -- we",1881.045,2.736
"had an election, it was a major issue",1883.781,1.969
in that election.,1885.75,1.068
And I think that even when you look across the,1886.818,1.735
"spectrum -- Republican, Democrat, liberal,",1888.553,2.302
conservative -- Judge Gorsuch has an,1890.855,2.803
unbelievable record and is being praised for that,1893.658,3.17
record because of that.,1896.828,1.535
"The Press: I want to ask about Friday, and there&amp;#39;s",1898.363,3.003
been some reporting that there will be a meeting,1901.366,1.868
with President Trump and JP Morgan&amp;#39;s,1903.234,2.736
CEO and others.,1905.97,1.035
Can you tell us a little but more about who else,1907.005,1.434
will be there and where,1908.439,1.268
things are at on financial reform?,1909.707,1.635
What message does the President have for bankers,1911.342,1.936
specifically on financial reform?,1913.278,1.334
Mr. Spicer: I think I&amp;#39;ll have more --,1914.612,1.368
The Press: We&amp;#39;ve heard so much on Obamacare and tax,1915.98,2.836
"reform, but it seems like financial reform has sort",1918.816,2.203
of fallen by the wayside.,1921.019,0.7
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I don&amp;#39;t -- I wouldn&amp;#39;t agree with",1921.719,1.335
that.,1923.054,0.667
I think that when you look at regulatory reform and,1923.721,1.669
tax reform and all of the steps that he&amp;#39;s been,1925.39,2.535
"taking to help the economy grow and to create jobs,",1927.925,3.838
that&amp;#39;s right in that wheelhouse.,1931.763,1.334
I&amp;#39;ll have -- I hope to have further updates on,1933.097,1.735
"the schedule for you tomorrow, but I don&amp;#39;t now.",1934.832,1.902
Mara?,1936.734,0.668
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",1937.402,0.667
"I have a question about foreign policy, but I",1938.069,1.735
wanted to follow up.,1939.804,1.001
"You said that LPRs no longer need a waiver, but",1940.805,2.302
you didn&amp;#39;t answer the question about what about,1943.107,1.869
the people who were put on planes?,1944.976,1.601
"People who were LPRs, but were put on planes back to",1946.577,2.136
where they came from.,1948.713,0.701
What happens to them?,1949.414,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Well, again, I think then they go",1950.081,1.335
through the process.,1951.416,0.667
It depends if they&amp;#39;re an LPR.,1952.083,2.202
"If not, then they go through the",1954.285,1.335
application process.,1955.62,0.834
That&amp;#39;s -- so if they are an LPR -- a Legal,1956.454,2.269
Permanent Resident -- then they --,1958.723,1.768
then they are waived.,1960.491,1.135
They can come rightt through,1961.626,1.034
The Press: So they just come back again?,1962.66,1.035
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s right.,1963.695,0.533
The Press: Okay.,1964.228,0.468
Mr. Spicer: But I don&amp;#39;t know how many,1964.696,1.234
cases that applies to.,1965.93,1.468
I know that if they&amp;#39;re not a legal permanent resident,1967.398,1.902
then they have to go back and that&amp;#39;s part of this,1969.3,2.169
vetting process.,1971.469,1.501
there&amp;#39;s a big difference.,1972.97,0.534
The Press: My question is about the fighting in,1973.504,3.204
Ukraine and Russia and Russia-backed rebels are,1976.708,3.67
moving the lines forward.,1980.378,1.168
And I&amp;#39;m wondering if the President feels that,1982.513,3.27
Russia is testing him because this is coming so,1985.783,2.469
early in his administration before he&amp;#39;s,1988.252,1.435
had a chance to fully assemble his team?,1989.687,3.237
And what he plans to do about it?,1992.924,1.168
Mr. Spicer: The President has been kept aware of,1994.092,1.601
through his National Security Council and his,1995.693,2.636
National Security Team as a whole what&amp;#39;s been going,1998.329,2.102
on in the Ukraine and we&amp;#39;ll have further updates,2000.865,2.102
as we go on. Yeah?,2003.301,0.467
"The Press: During the campaign last January,",2004.435,0.935
Donald Trump promised that on his first day in office,2005.703,75.109
he would get rid of gun free zones in schools and,2007.572,2.235
on military bases.,2010.208,1.334
"When can we expect action on that, and if so, can",2011.542,2.102
you share details of what we should expect?,2014.112,1.635
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, I&amp;#39;ll have -- I think you&amp;#39;ve",2016.08,1.802
seen that the President has been very active in,2018.149,1.034
terms of getting executive orders out and following,2019.55,1.569
up on the campaign pledges that he made the American,2021.486,2.168
people last night being another example of that.,2024.021,1.268
We&amp;#39;re going to continue to move through this process.,2025.857,1.434
And I think we&amp;#39;ll have further updates on where,2028.359,1.635
we are with respect to the rest of the EO process.,2029.994,1.869
"With that, I want to go to my third Skype seat.",2031.863,2.602
Lars Larson of the Lars Larson Show.,2034.465,3.304
"The Press: Commander Spicer, it&amp;#39;s a pleasure.",2037.769,1.768
Thanks for your service to America and thanks,2039.537,1.768
for the opportunity.,2041.305,1.435
I&amp;#39;ve got a broad question.,2042.74,1.802
The federal government is the biggest,2044.542,1.301
landlord in America.,2045.843,1.068
It owns two-thirds of a billion acres of America.,2046.911,2.736
I don&amp;#39;t think the founders ever envisioned,2050.281,1.368
it that way.,2052.016,0.801
Does President Trump want to start returning the,2052.817,1.468
people&amp;#39;s land to the people?,2054.819,1.935
"And, in the meantime, for a second question since",2056.754,2.536
"that&amp;#39;s in fashion these days, can he tell the",2059.29,2.136
Forest Service to start logging out forests,2061.426,2.569
aggressively again to provide jobs for,2063.995,1.868
"Americans, wealth for the Treasury, and not spend",2065.863,2.937
$3.5 billion a year fighting forest fires?,2068.8,3.403
"Mr. Spicer: Thanks, Lars.",2072.203,0.901
I think the President&amp;#39;s been very clear that as,2073.104,2.336
part of an overall comprehensive energy,2075.44,1.468
"solution, that we&amp;#39;ve got to utilize the resources",2076.908,1.568
that we have that the federal government owns,2078.476,3.737
whether that&amp;#39;s the forests or natural resources or,2082.213,3.17
minerals that exist above and below the ground.,2085.383,2.536
That we have too infrequently looked at our,2087.919,3.436
own resources and counted too much on foreign,2091.355,2.603
sources of energy.,2093.958,1.969
"So, you know, we&amp;#39;re going to continue as Congressman",2095.927,3.303
Zinke goes through the process to head up the,2099.23,1.735
interior department and Governor Perry goes,2100.965,2.569
through his appointment -- his confirmation process,2103.534,3.404
-- to get those individuals through.,2106.938,1.568
But then working together in areas where they have,2108.506,4.071
overlap and also areas where they will act,2112.577,2.602
"individually to realize, to look at those natural",2115.179,3.437
"resources that we have, figure out how to best",2118.616,2.202
"utilize them to benefit not just our energy, but",2120.818,3.47
also economic growth opportunities with that.,2124.288,2.303
Daniel Happer?,2126.591,2.068
The Press: I was wondering about executive orders.,2128.659,1.735
You haven&amp;#39;t really explained why the,2130.394,1.669
President&amp;#39;s using executive orders in the,2132.063,1.501
manner that he&amp;#39;s doing so.,2133.564,1.268
Why not take this extreme vetting to Congress and,2134.832,3.07
have the Congressional Bill?,2137.902,1.401
"And why not -- I mean, what is the",2139.303,2.002
philosophy behind --,2141.305,1.402
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I don&amp;#39;t -- I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a",2142.707,1.101
"binary choice, Daniel.",2143.808,1.168
"I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s, only do this.",2144.976,1.868
I think he has talked about -- especially in the,2146.844,2.302
"area of immigration he&amp;#39;s been very, very clear that",2149.146,2.269
this is a huge priority for him.,2151.415,2.636
And I think that he is going to continue to look,2154.051,2.703
at this from a holistic aspect.,2156.754,3.203
"In other words, Visas, Visa reform, the wall, our",2159.957,2.369
"southern border, our northern border -- all of",2164.095,2.469
"these things, you know, vetting.",2166.964,1.068
"There is a very, very comprehensive -- and those",2168.666,2.302
things in which he can do through executive order,2171.302,1.034
and action he will.,2172.603,0.768
Those things that he can do through working with,2173.371,3.87
Congress legislatively he&amp;#39;s going to,2177.675,1.001
continue to do as well.,2178.976,5.406
"The Press: The President&amp;#39;s top trade advisor, Peter",2184.382,2.335
"Navarro, told the Financial Times yesterday",2186.717,1.368
that he believed that the euro is grossly,2188.085,1.869
undervalued and Germany is benefitting from that and,2190.354,2.169
that&amp;#39;s why we have a huge trade deficit with Germany,2192.99,2.236
and with Europe.,2196.093,0.668
Does the President agree with that?,2197.328,2.469
That the Europe -- that the Euro is undervalued?,2200.431,0.968
"And if so, does he plan to do anything about it?",2201.699,0.934
Mr. Spicer: I think when it comes to currency,2202.967,0.934
valuation I&amp;#39;m not going to get -- yet.,2204.201,1.602
I think we&amp;#39;ve got a Secretary of Treasury,2206.637,2.269
that&amp;#39;s in the confirmation process and once that,2208.906,2.67
happens I think then Secretary Mnuchin will be,2211.576,3.036
able to address that as well. Yeah?,2214.946,2.135
"The Press: Sean, Dan Hausle, 7 News Boston.",2217.081,1.668
I&amp;#39;d like to ask you about Kelly Ayotte&amp;#39;s,2218.749,1.535
role shepherding --,2220.284,1.835
Mr. Spicer: I was hoping you&amp;#39;d ask about,2222.119,0.668
the Patriots.,2222.787,1.301
"The Press: Well, I would like to ask",2224.088,0.667
you about that.,2224.755,0.568
Mr. Spicer: You get a second after that.,2225.323,2.669
"The Press: Okay, I get a second, but can you talk",2227.992,0.701
about Kelly Ayotte&amp;#39;s role shepherding Justice,2228.693,1.635
Gorsuch around the Capitol Hill?,2230.328,1.668
Mr. Spicer: Sure.,2231.996,0.567
"Look, Senator Ayotte is someone who is respected",2232.563,4.271
on both sides of the aisle.,2236.834,2.536
She has a lot of great relationships.,2239.37,1.468
She&amp;#39;s a former attorney general.,2240.838,0.968
She understands the,2241.806,0.467
judicial process very well.,2242.273,1.468
"But she&amp;#39;s also -- I mean, this process is a -- is a",2243.741,2.202
-- is a relationship process by and far.,2245.943,2.569
"You&amp;#39;re going around introducing a judge,",2248.512,2.203
someone who has not generally been exposed to,2250.715,2.002
"the legislative process, definitely not the",2252.717,1.868
Congressional process.,2254.585,1.101
To the --,2255.686,0.901
The Press: Her relationship with,2256.587,0.901
President Trump was,2257.488,1.168
strained during the campaign.,2258.656,1.134
She kind of walked away from him --,2259.79,1.035
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s right.,2260.825,0.433
"And I think that that goes and shows, as I&amp;#39;ve",2261.258,1.302
mentioned several times both through the,2262.56,1.368
transition and early -- the President&amp;#39;s not,2263.928,2.669
holding some kind of test about what degree of,2266.597,2.069
support you had for him.,2268.666,1.969
He wants the best and brightest to continue to,2270.635,1.334
serve this country in,2271.969,0.868
whatever capacity they can.,2272.837,1.568
"I think Senator Ayotte, very, very helpfully",2274.405,3.87
offered up her services.,2278.275,1.535
She&amp;#39;s got a lot of relationships on both,2279.81,1.769
sides of the aisle.,2281.579,2.769
She&amp;#39;s got a tremendous amount of experience,2284.348,0.701
in this field.,2285.049,1.301
And I think the President thought she was extremely,2286.35,1.635
qualified to do this -- to help shepherd this,2287.985,2.703
unbelievably qualified Justice through this,2290.688,2.169
process.,2292.857,0.7
"And so she, as well as the team that we&amp;#39;ve gathered",2293.557,4.405
"of individuals on staff here, are going to help",2297.962,2.135
get Judge Gorsuch through the nomination process.,2300.097,2.036
"And I would say just as a side note, that if you",2302.133,3.069
look at the amazing job that has been done by the,2305.202,2.369
team during the transition and now to get these,2307.571,2.603
amazing individuals through the process,2310.174,2.336
despite all of the hype that continues to go,2312.51,2.435
"about, &amp;quot;This individual is going to",2314.945,0.701
face this problem.&amp;quot;,2315.646,0.934
"Or, &amp;quot;Which is the one person?&amp;quot;",2316.58,1.836
Each of them have really sailed through this,2318.416,2.235

"Democrats tried to land a -- you know, take them out",2322.82,3.437
and couldn&amp;#39;t land a glove.,2326.257,1.268
They&amp;#39;re unbelievably qualified.,2327.525,1.434
They&amp;#39;re unbelievably prepared.,2328.959,2.036
And I think that the same process that we followed,2330.995,2.536
with this is going to be followed with Judge,2333.531,2.169
Gorsuch and I think we&amp;#39;re going to have,2335.7,1.034
a very speedy --,2336.734,1.101
"The Press: As a follow up, as an unbiased Rhode",2337.835,2.402

affinity for Tom Brady and Bob Kraft.,2344.909,1.601
Mr. Spicer: I will.,2346.51,1.769

Senators Murkowski and Collins both say they&amp;#39;re,2353.651,1.601
going to go vote no on Betsy DeVos&amp;#39; nomination.,2355.252,2.87
That leaves zero votes to spare and Vice President,2358.122,2.836
Pence would have to cast the tie-breaking vote.,2360.958,1.335
"So, my questions are, how confident are you that you",2362.293,2.202
have all the other Republican,2364.495,1.201
senators locked down?,2365.696,1.702
And what&amp;#39;s the level of concern in the White House,2367.398,1.768
that her nomination is going to fail?,2369.166,1.435
Mr. Spicer: Zero.,2370.601,0.734
I am 100 percent confident she will be the next,2371.335,1.735
Secretary of Education.,2373.07,1.368
She is an unbelievably qualified educator and,2374.438,3.037
"advocate for students and teachers, parents -- it",2377.475,4.304
"would be -- you know, I think that the games that",2381.779,2.069
are being played with Betsy DeVos are sad.,2383.848,4.304
She is someone who&amp;#39;s been a tireless advocate over,2388.152,1.902
the last couple of decades to really support reforms,2390.054,1.435
that benefit children.,2391.489,3.536

as Secretary of Education.,2396.861,1.201
Sarah Murray?,2398.062,2.569
"The Press: Sean, in terms of the two Republican",2400.631,2.136
senators who are voting no on the Betsy DeVos and the,2402.767,1.201
outcry we saw from Republicans on the Hill,2403.968,2.035
last week -- earlier this week about how you guys,2406.003,2.469
dealt with the travel ban.,2408.472,0.868
"First, is there more that the Trump administration",2409.34,2.569
and Trump himself should be doing to ensure that,2411.909,2.336
his party is on the same page with his priorities?,2414.245,2.569
"And secondly, on the Yemen raid, can you give us more",2416.814,2.97
of an understanding of was there a discussion about,2419.784,2.469
the risks involved in this?,2422.253,1.568
Was it a straightforward decision?,2423.821,1.969
And do you guys still view it to be a success in,2425.79,2.268

Mr. Spicer: Yeah --,2429.426,0.568
The Press: -- of the navy seal.,2429.994,0.934
"Mr. Spicer: So first, I would just note, Sarah,",2430.928,1.235
that I&amp;#39;ve heard story after story in the last 40,2432.163,3.603
"days about how -- whether, you know, going back to",2435.766,2.903
the last question about these nominees,2438.669,1.135
not getting through.,2439.804,1.434
Rex Tillerson was going to go down and so-so was,2441.238,2.036
"going to, and every one of them, after they got to",2443.274,2.269
"meet with senators of both sides of the party, have",2445.543,2.569
shown why the President chose them because they,2448.112,3.036
"were unbelievably qualified, unbelievably",2451.148,3.404
ready to lead and enact an agenda of change in the,2454.552,3.136
"area of responsibility that they&amp;#39;re taking over,",2457.688,2.469
and I think the same is going to be true of,2460.157,1.435
everyone else who is remaining.,2461.592,1.602
The Press: But two members of your,2463.194,1.067
own party disagree.,2464.261,0.701
Mr. Spicer: So the vote hasn&amp;#39;t taken place.,2464.962,2.336
I think we&amp;#39;ve had some concerns in the past and I,2467.298,2.402
think when these nominees have met with them and,2469.7,2.136
shared with them their thoughts throughout the,2471.836,1.601
"process -- and again, you can go back, story after",2473.437,2.202
"story, and again each one of these folks who I&amp;#39;ve",2475.639,2.937
"heard isn&amp;#39;t going to make it, is going to go over",2478.576,2.235
the finish line each time.,2480.811,1.168
"And I think that, you know, we hear it over and",2481.979,3.07
over again and yet it&amp;#39;s -- we succeed every time and,2485.049,2.269
yet another roadblock is put up.,2487.318,1.401
"Well, this person won&amp;#39;t succeed.",2488.719,1.568
"And yet, you look at each one of these people going",2490.287,2.97
through the process and it&amp;#39;s worked beautifully,2493.257,2.269
"every time, and I think we&amp;#39;re going to",2495.526,1.234
continue that path.,2496.76,0.868
"With respect to Yemen, I think it&amp;#39;s hard to ever",2497.628,7.107
say something was successful when you,2504.735,1.735
lose a life.,2506.47,2.269
But you&amp;#39;ve got to understand that Chief,2508.739,2.402
"Owens, he went back, deployed 12 times because",2511.141,6.04
he loved this country and he believed,2517.181,1.101
in the mission.,2518.282,3.937
And knowing that we killed an estimated 14 AQAP,2522.219,7.307
members and that we gathered an unbelievable,2529.526,4.772
amount of intelligence that will prevent the,2534.298,2.202
potential deaths or attacks on American soil,2536.5,3.937
is something that I think most service members,2540.437,2.203
understand that that&amp;#39;s why they joined the service.,2542.64,2.102
"And so, you never want to call something a success",2544.742,5.005
100 percent when someone&amp;#39;s hurt or killed and that,2549.747,4.237
"was the case here, but I think that when you",2553.984,2.803
recognize that an individual like this loved,2556.787,5.305
this country so much and deployed over and over,2562.092,3.07
again because he knew that the mission that he was,2565.162,5.005
conducting was so important to our,2570.167,2.102
"protection, our freedom, our safety, and I know",2572.269,4.038
"when the President spoke to Karen, his wife, and",2576.307,3.036
"talked about, you know, the three children that he",2579.343,3.37
"left behind, she continued to be impressed with -- to",2582.713,3.904
"impress upon the President rather, that while it was",2586.617,2.269
an unbelievably sad and emotional time for her and,2588.886,2.436
"her family, that he loved doing this.",2591.322,3.77
"And so, you know, again I don&amp;#39;t think you ever call",2595.092,4.438
"anything 100 percent success, but what he did",2599.53,3.069
"for this nation and we got out of that mission, I",2602.599,3.003
think -- I truly believe and I know the President,2605.602,1.969
"believes, is going to save American lives.",2607.571,2.536

at both state and national levels and not only forget,2637.701,2.336
"us, but to turn on us.",2640.037,2.269

believe -- or the President has very clearly,2656.52,2.669
"stated, that clean coal in particular is an issue",2659.189,3.838
that&amp;#39;s so important to our energy independence as,2663.027,4.137
well as our job creation in this country and so,2667.164,2.236
whether you&amp;#39;re talking about Kentucky or West,2669.4,1.501
Virginia or Pennsylvania or so many other places in,2670.901,2.236
"this country that rely on coal, bringing the",2673.137,3.503
production of clean coal back is good for our,2676.64,2.703
"energy independence, it&amp;#39;s good for our economy, it&amp;#39;s",2679.343,2.903
"good for job creation, and it&amp;#39;s something that he",2682.246,2.102
continues to talk about.,2684.348,1.368
And I think once we have a Secretary of Energy,2685.716,4.204
"confirmed, that we can continue to take steps and",2689.92,2.336
move forward with -- Fin Gomez.,2692.256,2.235
The Press: Thank you.,2694.491,0.768
Mr. Spicer: Where&amp;#39;s Fin?,2695.259,2.536
The Press: Two questions for you.,2697.795,0.9
After the primetime announcement last night it,2698.695,2.036
seems like the numbers were good.,2700.731,1.101
Do you have a sense that this President will be,2701.832,1.702
more aggressive than his predecessors on seeking,2703.534,3.703
"primetime air play for his announcements and two, top",2707.237,5.439
Democrats are asking the defense department to,2712.676,1.969
investigate Michael Flynn for possible violations of,2714.645,3.87
"the Constitution, do you have a -- it sounds like",2718.515,3.17
you saw that story.,2721.685,0.768
Do you have a response to that?,2722.453,1.935
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, I think on the air time issue,",2724.388,1.601
that&amp;#39;s something we&amp;#39;re not particularly suffering,2725.989,2.57
"from when it comes to attention, and I think the",2728.559,2.502
President does a phenomenal job of getting,2731.061,3.904
attention and getting his message out.,2734.965,1.802
His use of social media in particular is something,2736.767,2.402
"that, when you look at the number of people, I think",2739.169,2.469
we did something like 11 million people watching,2741.638,1.936
the address on Facebook Live last night.,2743.574,2.936
"Obviously, if we have important issues to",2746.51,1.635
discuss with the nation or announcements to make or,2748.145,2.836
"nominations, then we&amp;#39;ll request time.",2750.981,2.903
I don&amp;#39;t think that that&amp;#39;s something we&amp;#39;ve spent a,2753.884,1.868
ton of time figuring out.,2755.752,1.168
I think we&amp;#39;re doing pretty well on that front.,2756.92,2.469
"And then I&amp;#39;m sorry, the second question, Mike?",2759.389,1.102
The Press: The request from Democrats to,2760.491,2.636
investigate Flynn for a possible violation of the,2763.127,2.535
Emoluments Clause.,2765.662,2.136
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, so General Flynn like, I",2767.798,3.036
think probably countless if not hundreds of retired,2770.834,3.871
"flag officers, joined a speaking bureau and has",2774.705,3.303
given speeches at various places and I think that,2778.008,2.603
that is something that is kept in practice and the,2780.611,2.302
"Department of Defense is, you know, the appropriate",2782.913,2.169
"place for them to review it, but as I said, I think",2785.082,2.569
that when you look at so many countless retired,2787.651,2.97
"flag officers, that&amp;#39;s something that generally",2790.621,1.968
keeps with in -- Zeke.,2792.589,1.402
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",2793.991,1.134
"General Flynn, when he was up here, offered some",2795.125,1.802
criticism about the Obama Administration&amp;#39;s handling,2796.927,2.269
of Iran in particular.,2799.196,1.702
Is that something we should be expecting to,2800.898,2.002
"hear more for this administration, whether it",2802.9,1.701
"be on foreign policy or other issues, criticism of",2804.601,2.469
previous administration going forward?,2807.07,3.437
Mr. Spicer: I think in areas where there&amp;#39;s going,2810.507,1.769
"to be a sharp difference, particularly in national",2812.276,2.035
"security, in contrasting the policies that this",2814.311,3.103
"President is seeking to make the country safer,",2817.414,2.903
"stronger, more prosperous, he&amp;#39;s going to draw those",2820.317,2.336
"distinctions and contrasts out, but in this",2822.653,3.436
"particular area, I think that the President when it",2826.089,2.937
"comes -- came to the Iran nuclear deal was very,",2829.026,3.336
very adamant in his opposition to the deal and,2832.362,3.804
to its implications.,2836.166,1.301
"And so, he&amp;#39;s going to continue to make sure that",2837.467,2.903
"the American people know that some of these deals,",2840.37,3.904
"you know, things that were left by the previous",2844.274,2.503
administration that he wants to make very clear,2846.777,3.069
what his position is and his opposition to them.,2849.846,2.236
"And you know, the action and the notice that he put",2852.082,2.669
Iran on today is something that is important because,2854.751,4.104
I think the American people voted,2858.855,1.502
on change again.,2860.357,1.101
This is another issue that he was very clear about.,2861.458,1.902
"So, with that, thank you guys.",2863.36,1.168
I&amp;#39;ll see you tomorrow.,2864.528,0.801
"Take care, have a good day.",2865.329,1.268
