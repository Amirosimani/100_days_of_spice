Mr. Spicer: Good afternoon.,0,2.936
Happy Valentine&amp;#39;s Day.,2.936,2.202
I can sense the love in the room.,5.138,2.135
(Laughter.),7.273,1.669
"First off, last night, the Treasury",8.942,1.735
Department&amp;#39;s Office of Foreign Asset Control --,10.677,2.335
OFAC -- labeled the Venezuelan Vice President,13.012,2.703
as a specially designated narcotics trafficker,15.715,3.07
under the Kingpin Act.,18.785,1.401
Before I continue with the briefing and look forward,20.186,2.603
"to your questions, I want to turn it over for a",22.789,2.436
"short time to newly minted Secretary of the Treasury,",25.225,3.27
"Steven Mnuchin, to issue a brief statement on",28.495,3.97
this and deliver a few questions.,32.465,3.103
Secretary Mnuchin.,35.568,1.035
Secretary Mnuchin: Pleasure to be here on my,36.603,2.369
first busy day in office.,38.972,3.437
"Yesterday, the Department of Treasury&amp;#39;s Office of",42.409,2.369
"Foreign Asset Control, known as OFAC, designated",44.778,3.136
Venezuelan national Tareck El Aissami as a specially,47.914,4.771
designated narcotics trafficker pursuant to the,52.685,3.07
Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act for,55.755,3.537
playing a significant role in international,59.292,3.103
narcotics trafficking.,62.395,1.201
"El Aissami&amp;#39;s primary frontman, Venezuelan",63.596,3.604
national Samark Lopez,67.2,1.635
Bellow was also designated.,68.835,2.97
These designations follow a multi-year investigation,71.805,3.47
into El Aissami&amp;#39;s criminal activities.,75.275,2.936
And President Trump appreciates the hard work,78.211,2.569
"put into this case by the Department of Treasury,",80.78,3.07
"the Department of State, as well as the National",83.85,2.636
Security Council and many people throughout,86.486,2.636
law enforcement.,89.122,1.868
Following the signing of the executive order last,90.99,2.369
week designing to break the back of criminal drug,93.359,3.404
"cartels, this action demonstrates the",96.763,2.602
President&amp;#39;s seriousness about fighting the scourge,99.365,3.771
of drugs in the United States.,103.136,2.936
"In addition, he wants to send a clear message to",106.072,3.237
the people of Venezuela that America,109.309,2.602
stands with them.,111.911,2.403
"And with that, I&amp;#39;m happy to take two or three",114.314,2.502
questions specifically about this.,116.816,4.605
"The Press: Secretary Mnuchin, since sanctions",121.421,1.501
"are directly relevant, obviously, to the Treasury",122.922,1.869
"Department, which is an agency that you now",124.791,1.802
"oversee, can you talk a little bit about plans to",126.593,2.168
sanction Russia and if you&amp;#39;ll keep Obama-era,128.761,2.336
sanctions against Russia?,131.097,1.835
Secretary Mnuchin: Our current sanctions programs,132.932,1.368
"are in place, and I would say sanctions are an",134.3,2.603
important tool that we will continue to look at,136.903,3.136
for various different countries.,140.039,1.402
But it&amp;#39;s a very important program within the,141.441,2.202
Treasury Department.,143.643,0.934
The Press: And for Russia specifically?,144.577,1.735
Secretary Mnuchin: The existing policies,146.312,1.835
are in place.,148.147,0.668
"The Press: Mr. Secretary, are you contemplating any",148.815,2.436
additional sanctions against Iran?,151.251,1.835
And can you tell us what you think the bottom line,153.086,2.469
will be at these particular sanctions you,155.555,1.501
announced yesterday and are referring to today,157.056,1.702
with the Venezuelan Vice President?,158.758,1.335
What&amp;#39;s it going to mean?,160.093,1.101
"Secretary Mnuchin: Well, first, let me just comment",161.194,2.069
"-- again, this is as a result of a very long",163.263,3.97
effort --,167.233,0.668
"The Press: Did you (inaudible) the implication, by the way?",167.901,1.334
"Secretary Mnuchin: Yes, this was underway.",169.235,1.335
This was a very long effort.,170.57,1.101
But the implication is quite significant.,171.671,2.803
We expect that there will be frozen tens of millions,174.474,2.436
"of dollars and, again, that sanctions are a very",176.91,3.169
important way of us sending a message that we,180.079,2.837
"will not stand for illicit activities, whether",182.916,2.702
they&amp;#39;re drug trafficking or terrorism.,185.618,1.902
"The Press: On Iran, sir?",187.52,0.667
"The Press: Secretary, including sanctions, what",188.187,1.836
other tools are you looking at?,190.023,1.735
"Secretary Mnuchin: I can&amp;#39;t comment on all the tools,",191.758,2.302
"but, again, let me just reinforce that sanctions",194.06,2.236
are a very important tool within the department and,196.296,2.168
we will use them as appropriate.,198.464,1.335
The Press: What about freezing assets?,199.799,1.335
"Secretary Mnuchin: In this case, we did freeze assets",201.134,1.334
"-- again, as I mentioned, tens of millions of",202.468,1.335
dollars of assets.,203.803,0.667
And that will have a very big impact on this.,204.47,5.005
So I&amp;#39;ll take one more question please.,212.845,2.103
"Yes, in the back.",214.948,0.767
"The Press: During the campaign, the President",215.715,3.303
had made comments about Janet Yellen and whether,219.018,5.539
-- basically inferring that she was being too,224.557,2.336
political and that she,226.893,1.168
should be ashamed of herself.,228.061,1.468
Do the folks at the Treasury Department and,229.529,2.302
within the administration feel confident with,231.831,1.869
Mrs. Yellen at the helm and to be able to set,233.7,5.071
monetary policy going forward?,238.771,1.001
"Secretary Mnuchin: Well, let me just comment.",239.772,1.535
"I&amp;#39;m really here today, again, to talk about the",241.307,1.969
Venezuelan situation.,243.276,1.335
But let me just say that there is a tradition of,244.611,3.003
the Secretary of Treasury having ongoing meetings,247.614,2.902
"with the head of the Federal Reserve, and I",250.516,1.802
look forward to that now that I&amp;#39;m in office doing,252.318,2.536
that and spending time with her.,254.854,1.401
"Thank you very much, everybody.",256.255,1.369
It&amp;#39;s a pleasure to be here on my first day.,257.624,2.369
"Mr. Spicer: All right, let&amp;#39;s get back to the fun.",259.993,6.606
We&amp;#39;ve been reviewing -- and I want to address the,266.599,2.603
"events of last night, first and foremost.",269.202,2.536
We&amp;#39;ve been reviewing and evaluating this issue with,271.738,2.669
respect to General Flynn on a daily basis for a few,274.407,2.469
"weeks, trying to ascertain the truth.",276.876,2.836
"We got to a point not based on a legal issue,",279.712,2.403
"but based on a trust issue, where a level of",282.115,2.369
trust between the President and General,284.484,2.202
Flynn had eroded to the point where he felt he had,286.686,2.736
to make a change.,289.422,1.335
The President was very concerned that General,290.757,1.801
Flynn had misled the Vice President and others.,292.558,3.437
He was also very concerned in light of sensitive,295.995,2.436
subjects dealt with by that position of national,298.431,2.436
"security advisors -- like China, North Korea and the",300.867,2.702
Middle East -- that the President must have,303.569,2.136
complete and unwavering trust for the person in,305.705,3.036
that position.,308.741,1.835
The evolving and eroding level of trust as a result,310.576,2.703
of this situation and a series of other,313.279,2.336
questionable instances is what led the President to,315.615,3.236
ask for General Flynn&amp;#39;s resignation.,318.851,2.87
Immediately after the Department of Justice,321.721,2.102
"notified the White House Counsel of the situation,",323.823,3.003
the White House Counsel briefed the President and,326.826,2.402
a small group of senior advisors.,329.228,1.902
The White House Counsel reviewed and determined,331.13,2.87
"that there is not a legal issue,",334,2.302
but rather a trust issue.,336.302,1.402
During this process it&amp;#39;s important to note that the,337.704,2.502
"President did not have his Attorney General, Jeff",340.206,2.202
"Sessions, who he trusts immensely, approved",342.408,2.336
by the Senate.,344.744,1.435
When the President heard the information as,346.179,1.568
"presented by White House Counsel, he instinctively",347.747,2.302
"thought that General Flynn did not do anything wrong,",350.049,3.337
and the White House Counsel&amp;#39;s review,353.386,1.735
corroborated that.,355.121,1.768
It is not ordinary* [unordinary] for an,356.889,1.535
incoming National Security Advisor to speak with his,358.424,2.269
counterparts about the issues of concern to them.,360.693,3.17
"In fact, he spoke with over 30 of his",363.863,1.635
counterparts throughout the transition.,365.498,2.469
"As Charles Krauthammer said last night, it is",367.967,1.869
&amp;quot;perfectly reasonable for him to do so.&amp;quot;,369.836,3.303
The issue here was that the President got to the,373.139,3.07
point where General Flynn&amp;#39;s relationship --,376.209,1.902
"misleading the Vice President and others, or",378.111,2.936
the possibility that he had forgotten critical,381.047,2.069
details of this important conversation had created a,383.116,3.136
critical mass and an unsustainable situation.,386.252,3.47
That&amp;#39;s why the President decided to ask for his,389.722,2.069
"resignation, and he got it.",391.791,2.769
The irony of this entire situation is that the,394.56,2.102
President has been,396.662,1.102
incredibly tough on Russia.,397.764,1.201
"He continues to raise the issue of Crimea, which the",398.965,3.537
previous administration had allowed to be seized,402.502,2.135
by Russia.,404.637,1.034
"His Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki",405.671,1.869
"Haley, stood before the U.N.",407.54,1.568
Security Council on her first day and strongly,409.108,2.836
denounced the Russian occupation of Crimea.,411.944,2.97
"As Ambassador Haley said at the time, the &amp;quot;dire",414.914,2.97
situation in Eastern Ukraine is one that,417.884,2.469
demands clear and strong condemnation,420.353,3.203
of Russian actions.&amp;quot;,423.556,1.668
President Trump has made it very clear that he,425.224,1.802
expects the Russian government to deescalate,427.026,2.236
violence in the Ukraine and return Crimea.,429.262,2.435
"At the same time, he fully expects to and wants to be",431.697,3.737
"able to get along with Russia, unlike previous",435.434,2.37
"administrations, so that we can solve many problems",437.804,2.836
"together facing the world, such as the threat of",440.64,1.835
ISIS and terrorism.,442.475,2.069
The President is currently evaluating a group of very,444.544,2.669
strong candidates that will be considered to fill,447.213,3.003
the National Security Advisor position,450.216,1.802
"permanently, and is confident in the ability",452.018,2.302
"of General Kellogg, a decorated and",454.32,2.102
"distinguished veteran of the United States Army,",456.422,2.469
until that person is ultimately chosen.,458.891,3.037
Before I get into the President&amp;#39;s schedule for,461.928,1.568
"today, a quick recap of the President&amp;#39;s activity",463.496,2.269
"over the last few days, since we haven&amp;#39;t had the",465.765,2.169
honor of spending so much time together.,467.934,2.302
The President has been keeping a close eye on the,470.236,1.902
Oroville Dam situation in California.,472.138,3.036
"We&amp;#39;ve worked closely with Doug LaMalfa, who",475.174,2.403
"represents California&amp;#39;s First District, where the",477.577,2.269
"dam is located, and other state officials to help",479.846,2.802
people who have been impacted.,482.648,1.802
The situation is a textbook example of why we,484.45,2.636
need to pursue a major infrastructure,487.086,2.302
package in Congress.,489.388,1.168
"Dams, bridges, roads, and all ports around the",490.556,3.103
county have fallen into disrepair.,493.659,2.636
"In order to prevent the next disaster, we will",496.295,2.469
pursue the President&amp;#39;s vision for an overhaul of,498.764,2.87
our nation&amp;#39;s crumbling infrastructure.,501.634,2.336
We hope everyone remains safe as the evacuations,503.97,2.369
"continue, and we&amp;#39;ll be working alongside with",506.339,2.502
FEMA and appropriate government entities to,508.841,2.336
make sure that we are doing everything we can to,511.177,2.602
attend to this matter.,513.779,1.469
The President was honored also to welcome the Prime,515.248,2.235
Minister of Japan last week from their first,517.483,2.469
official meeting at the White House to their joint,519.952,2.303
"press conference at Mar-a-Lago -- excuse me,",522.255,1.935
their joint press conference and their time,524.19,1.501
together at Mar-a-Lago.,525.691,1.235
The President and the Prime Minister had a,526.926,1.468
productive visit that reaffirmed their,528.394,2.135
determination to further strengthen the U.S.-Japan,530.529,2.87
alliance and economic relationship.,533.399,2.769
"At Mar-a-Lago, the President was proud to",536.168,1.769
stand behind Prime Minister Abe on Saturday,537.937,2.436
to convey the United States&amp;#39; unwavering support,540.373,3.47
for our Japanese allies in the face of North Korea&amp;#39;s,543.843,2.736
most recent missile launch.,546.579,2.102
"On Sunday, the President met with now-Secretary of",548.681,2.202
Treasury Mnuchin and Mr. Steve Wynn before,550.883,2.503
returning to Washington.,553.386,1.535
"Yesterday, the President had an incredibly",554.921,2.602
productive set of meetings and discussions with Prime,557.523,2.803
"Minister Trudeau of Canada, focusing on our",560.326,2.703
shared commitment to close cooperation in addressing,563.029,2.802
both the challenges facing our two countries and the,565.831,2.636
problems throughout the world.,568.467,1.669
Our countries share a profound economic interest,570.136,2.269
with more than $2 billion in two-way trade flowing,572.405,2.669
across our border every day.,575.074,1.869
The President was pleased to launch the,576.943,1.601
Canada-United States Council for the,578.544,2.269
Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs and Business,580.813,2.202
Leaders by holding a roundtable discussion here,583.015,2.503
at the White House.,585.518,1.334
"Together with Prime Minister Trudeau, his",586.852,2.002
"daughter Ivanka, the President discussed the",588.854,2.069
unique challenges that women face in the,590.923,1.602
workplace with an incredible group of,592.525,2.068
successful and respected female business executives,594.593,3.437
from both countries.,598.03,1.201
A full list of the participants is available,599.231,1.802
through the pool.,601.033,1.302
In addition to his in-person meetings with,602.335,2.035
"the prime ministers of Japan and Canada, the",604.37,2.035
President also recently had phone calls with the,606.405,1.735
"presidents of Tunisia, Peru, Nigeria, Colombia",608.14,3.337
and South Africa.,611.477,1.201
Readouts are available on all of those calls.,612.678,2.136
"Finally, following the Prime Minister&amp;#39;s visit",614.814,3.537
"yesterday, the President met with Chairwoman",618.351,1.635
McDaniel and Co-Chairman Paduchik of the Republican,619.986,2.635
National Committee.,622.621,1.135
"In the afternoon, the President participated in",623.756,1.768
"a pinning ceremony for Major Ricardo Turner, one",625.524,2.703
of his military aides.,628.227,1.568
"The aides to the President are mid-grade officers,",629.795,2.002
one from of each of the services.,631.797,1.368
They provide direct support to the President,633.165,2.369
"in his role as Commander-in-Chief, and",635.534,3.304
their primary responsibilities are to,638.838,1.668
"serve as an emergency action officer,",640.506,1.735
"aide-de-camp, and ceremonial aide.",642.241,2.402
It&amp;#39;s a longstanding tradition that when the,644.643,1.602
President&amp;#39;s military aide is promoted to the next,646.245,2.436
"higher grade, the President conducts",648.681,1.702
that promotion.,650.383,1.134
"Major Ricardo Turner, the President&amp;#39;s military aide,",651.517,2.87
"was recently promoted to Lieutenant Colonel, and",654.387,2.068
the promotion was held in the Oval Office.,656.455,2.303
The President also spoke yesterday with Maureen,658.758,1.935
Scalia on the one-year anniversary of her,660.693,1.835
husband&amp;#39;s passing.,662.528,1.401
The President and Mrs. Scalia discussed her,663.929,2.002
"late husband&amp;#39;s incredible legacy, and how the",665.931,2.236
President is making every effort to carry it on by,668.167,2.703

swearing-in of Secretary Mnuchin in,678.944,1.635
the Oval Office.,680.579,1.135
Secretary Mnuchin is a world-class financier,681.714,1.868
whose decades of experience with financial,683.582,2.937
and monetary matters make him the ideal person to,686.519,3.103
"spearhead the President&amp;#39;s plan to develop a dynamic,",689.622,2.969
booming economy that works for all Americans.,692.591,3.137
We&amp;#39;re glad to officially have him on board.,695.728,2.035
"Now, moving on to the schedule for today -- this",697.763,1.935
"morning, the President and newly confirmed Secretary",699.698,2.002

"meeting with parents and educators from public,",704.637,2.068
"private, charter, and home schools this morning.",706.705,2.303
The President opened the meeting by congratulating,709.008,1.935
Secretary DeVos for her toughness and staying the,710.943,2.703
course throughout her confirmation process.,713.646,2.235
He then discussed his vision for all Americans,715.881,1.802
to have an opportunity to climb the ladder of,717.683,2.202
"success, starting with making quality education",719.885,2.57
available to every child no matter their zip code.,722.455,3.236
"Under the current system, the President believes too",725.691,2.035
many of our children are trapped in failing,727.726,1.602
"schools, especially in the African",729.328,1.602
American community.,730.93,0.734
The President told the group to begin addressing,731.664,2.335
"this problem, which he views as a",733.999,1.335
civil rights issue.,735.334,1.135
He wants parents to be able to decide what,736.469,1.601
educational options are best for their children.,738.07,2.803
The group launched into a wide-ranging discussion,740.873,2.202
"that included public and charter schools,",743.075,1.969
"home-schooling, dropout prevention, and the BASIS",745.044,3.003
"Schools Program, states&amp;#39; responsibilities, and the",748.047,2.936
current state of the U.S.,750.983,1.435
Department of Education.,752.418,1.501
The President&amp;#39;s ultimate goal is to create safe,753.919,2.136
"communities, great schools,",756.055,1.301
and well-paying jobs.,757.356,1.769
He believes that each of these goals is linked to,759.125,1.668
"the others, and the Trump administration is taking",760.793,2.035
concrete steps to achieve them all.,762.828,2.136
The President also spoke on the phone earlier today,764.964,1.835
"with Prime Minister May of the United Kingdom,",766.799,2.002
continuing the productive conversation they started,768.801,2.002
during her visit earlier this year.,770.803,1.802
A readout on that call should be coming soon.,772.605,2.536
The President then had lunch with New Jersey,775.141,1.601
Governor Chris Christie and his wife regarding,776.742,2.569
combatting drug use.,779.311,1.769
"At 2:00, the President will sign House Joint",781.08,1.968
Resolution 41 in the Oval Office.,783.048,2.369
The resolution is a start of rolling back harmful,785.417,2.336
"Obama-era regulations, which have cost the",787.753,2.369
American business consumers a staggering,790.122,2.569
"$890 billion, making our companies less competitive",792.691,5.139
and even driving some of them out of business.,797.83,2.469
The American free enterprise system is the,800.299,1.635
greatest engine for economic prosperity in the,801.934,2.236
"world, but for too many, to reach its maximum",804.17,3.069
"potential, we must remove the barriers to",807.239,2.67
productivity that are holding back our great,809.909,3.069
workers and businesses.,812.978,1.602
"Misguided federal regulations, such as the",814.58,2.736
"SEC rule addressed by HJR 41, inflict real cost on",817.316,4.705
"the American people and put our businesses,",822.021,2.402
"especially small businesses, at a",824.423,1.435
significant disadvantage.,825.858,1.535
It&amp;#39;s a priority for the Trump administration to,827.393,2.569
fix our broken regulatory system so that it enhances,829.962,3.036
American productivity and wellbeing without imposing,832.998,3.404
unnecessary costs and burdens.,836.402,2.302
Signing this joint resolution is one more,838.704,1.802
step towards achieving this goal.,840.506,1.868
"Later this evening, the President will meet with",842.374,1.468
Secretary Kelly and Attorney General Sessions,843.842,2.403
to continue discussions on potential options for,846.245,2.302
addressing the very clear national security threats,848.547,3.003
we&amp;#39;re facing in light of the recent,851.55,1.769
Supreme Court ruling.,853.319,1.234
"Tomorrow, the President is pleased to be welcoming",854.553,3.07
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,857.623,2.069
to the White House.,859.692,1.701
They will discuss ways to advance and strengthen the,861.393,1.969
special relationship between our two countries,863.362,2.002
and stability in the Middle East.,865.364,2.236
They will consult on a range of issues --,867.6,1.868
regional issues -- including addressing the,869.468,2.069
"threats posed by Iran and its proxies, the crisis in",871.537,3.336
"Syria, and countering ISIS and other",874.873,2.103
terrorist groups.,876.976,1.234
"As the President has made clear, his administration",878.21,2.069
will work to achieve comprehensive agreement,880.279,1.969
that would end the Israeli-Palestinian,882.248,2.102
conflict so that Israelis and Palestinians can live,884.35,3.069
in peace and security.,887.419,1.735
The way forward toward that goal will also be,889.154,2.636
discussed between the President and,891.79,1.335
the Prime Minister.,893.125,1.602
"They will hold a joint press conference tomorrow,",894.727,1.568
"as well, and further guidance will be coming on",896.295,1.969
the time and location.,898.264,1.501
"Looking ahead to Friday, the President will travel",899.765,1.768
"to Charleston, South Carolina, to attend the",901.533,1.635
rollout of the first Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner.,903.168,3.971
This visit will give the President an opportunity,907.139,1.635
to celebrate a huge milestone for thousands of,908.774,2.436
"workers at Boeing, America&amp;#39;s number-one",911.21,2.102
exporter and the millions of American workers,913.312,2.069
involved in aerospace.,915.381,1.368
"This trip has been months in the making, and we&amp;#39;re",916.749,1.601
thrilled to celebrate the rollout of,918.35,1.869
this amazing plane.,920.219,1.401
"With that, I&amp;#39;d be glad to take some",921.62,1.335
of your questions.,922.955,0.701
Jonathan Karl.,923.656,0.767
"The Press: Back in January, the President",924.423,3.103
said that nobody in his campaign had been in touch,927.526,2.503
with the Russians.,930.029,1.334
"Now, today, can you still say definitively that",931.363,3.203
"nobody on the Trump campaign, not even General",934.566,2.837
"Flynn, had any contact with the Russians",937.403,2.569
before the election?,939.972,0.667
Mr. Spicer: M understanding is that what,940.639,1.835
General Flynn has now expressed is that during,942.474,2.603
"the transition period -- well, we were very clear",945.077,1.835
"that during the transition period, he did speak with",946.912,2.736
the ambassador -- The Press: I&amp;#39;m talking about,949.648,1.769
during the campaign.,951.417,0.8
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t have any -- there&amp;#39;s nothing,952.217,1.435
that would conclude me -- that anything different,953.652,1.769
has changed with respect to that time period.,955.421,1.468
The Press: And why would the President -- if he was,956.889,1.535
notified 17 days ago that Flynn had misled the Vice,958.424,3.904
"President, other officials here, and that he was a",962.328,2.502
"potential threat to blackmail by the Russians,",964.83,2.703
why would he be kept on for almost three weeks?,967.533,3.27
"Mr. Spicer: Well, that&amp;#39;s not -- that assumes a lot",970.803,2.602
of things that are not true.,973.405,1.335
The President was informed of this.,974.74,1.435
He asked the White House Counsel to review the,976.175,1.701
situation.,977.876,0.668
The first matter was whether there was,978.544,1.902
a legal issue.,980.446,1.167
"We had to review whether there was a legal issue,",981.613,2.97
which the White House Counsel concluded there,984.583,1.735
"was not, as I stated in my comments.",986.318,2.002
This was an act of trust.,988.32,1.969
Whether or not he actually misled the Vice President,990.289,2.702
"was the issue, and that was ultimately what led to",992.991,3.07
the President asking for and accepting the,996.061,2.369
resignation of General Flynn.,998.43,1.502
"That&amp;#39;s it, pure and simple.",999.932,1.134
It was a matter of trust.,1001.066,1.435
"We went through a very deliberative process, a",1002.501,2.502
very thorough review.,1005.003,1.202
The first part of it was clearly to understand the,1006.205,2.469
"legal aspect of this, and that was simply concluded",1008.674,3.57
there was no legal aspect.,1012.244,1.368
And then what happened is the President evaluated,1013.612,1.835
the trust aspect of it. Major.,1015.447,2.303
The Press: When the President was asked on Air,1017.75,1.534
"Force One yesterday -- I mean, on Friday, rather,",1019.284,2.369
"traveling down to Mar-a-Lago, about reports",1021.653,2.269
about conversations with the Russians about,1023.922,2.236
"sanctions, he said, &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know about it.",1026.158,2.769
I&amp;#39;ll look into that.&amp;quot;,1028.927,0.901
Was he being truthful?,1029.828,1.135
Mr. Spicer: What he was asked specifically is was,1030.963,2.736
he aware of a Washington Post story.,1033.699,2.269
He hadn&amp;#39;t seen that at the time.,1035.968,1.334
"Of course, he was involved; I just said that",1037.302,1.702
he was aware of the situation right after the,1039.004,1.735
White House Counsel informed him,1040.739,1.335
back in January.,1042.074,0.801
The Press: And his inquiry to the White House Counsel,1042.875,2.903
"was strictly about the legalities involved, not",1045.778,2.836
the propriety of the conversations between,1048.614,1.668
General Flynn and the Russian ambassador?,1050.282,1.668
"Mr. Spicer: Well, initially, just to be --",1051.95,1.735
The Press: Do you have any criticism of the merits of,1053.685,2.737
those conversations about sanctions before the Trump,1056.422,1.801
administration had been inaugurated?,1058.223,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: So just to be clear, the acting Attorney",1059.558,2.97
General informed the White House Counsel that they,1062.528,4.004
wanted to give a &amp;quot;heads up&amp;quot; to us on some comments,1066.532,3.303
that may have seemed in conflict with what he had,1069.835,3.704
sent the Vice President out in particular.,1073.539,2.269
The White House Counsel informed the,1075.808,1.401
President immediately.,1077.209,1.301
The President asked him to conduct a review of,1078.51,1.835
whether there was a legal situation there.,1080.345,2.103
That was immediately determined,1082.448,1.167
that there wasn&amp;#39;t.,1083.615,0.901
That was what the President believed at the,1084.516,1.368
"time, from what he had been told, and he was",1085.884,2.236
proved to be correct.,1088.12,1.335
"The issue, pure and simple, came down to a",1089.455,2.102
matter of trust.,1091.557,1.401
And the President concluded that he no,1092.958,1.668
longer had the trust of his national security,1094.626,1.802
advisor over -- The Press: But was it proper for the,1096.428,2.903
"incoming national security advisor, not part of an",1099.331,2.803
"administration, to be discussing an issue as",1102.134,2.269
sensitive as sanctions,1104.403,1.001
with the Russian ambassador?,1105.404,1.268
Mr. Spicer: His job is to discuss issues,1106.672,3.303
with his counterparts.,1109.975,1.101
"I mean, Charles Krauthammer put it",1111.076,1.335
perfectly last night -- that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s,1112.411,1.435
supposed to be doing.,1113.846,1.067
"I mean, that&amp;#39;s his job.",1114.913,1.468
We would constantly read out throughout the,1116.381,2.303
"transition who he was speaking to, how he",1118.684,2.335
was getting ready.,1121.019,0.801
The President was receiving congratulatory,1121.82,1.869
calls from around the world.,1123.689,1.568
We would read out the world leader calls.,1125.257,1.735
The job of the incoming NSA is to sit down with,1126.992,2.236
"the counterparts and start that dialogue, and that&amp;#39;s",1129.228,3.27
exactly what he did.,1132.498,1.267
So the question wasn&amp;#39;t did he do anything improper or,1133.765,2.236
"legal, it&amp;#39;s a question",1136.001,0.834
of could he be trusted further.,1136.835,1.602
"And that trust, or the erosion of that trust,",1138.437,2.569
"was, frankly, the issue.",1141.006,0.801
The Press: Did the President instruct him to,1141.807,3.303
talk about sanctions with the Russian ambassador?,1145.11,1.502
"Mr. Spicer: No, absolutely not.",1146.612,1.101
"No, no, no.",1147.713,0.667
But that -- no.,1148.38,1.101
And there&amp;#39;s no -- that&amp;#39;s never -- The Press: So,1149.481,2.036
would he have preferred he had not done that?,1151.517,2.068
"Mr. Spicer: Look, I think the President had no",1153.585,2.036
problem with the fact that he acted in accord with,1155.621,2.469
what his job was supposed to be doing.,1158.09,1.735
He had an ability to talk about issues that were,1159.825,2.102
"important, whether it was that or the 30 other",1161.927,2.002
countries that he spoke to.,1163.929,1.068
"That was part of his job, as has been",1164.997,2.369
noted by many people.,1167.366,0.967
"That&amp;#39;s what the national security advisor and,",1168.333,2.102
"frankly, other positions do -- they begin the",1170.435,2.169
process of preparing their incoming job by talking to,1172.604,3.437
"counterparts, people who have previously held the",1176.041,1.735
"job, et cetera.",1177.776,1.068
"If he had not done that, there would be questions",1178.844,1.902
as to whether he&amp;#39;s properly prepared,1180.746,1.368
on day one.,1182.114,0.667
The Press: So he (inaudible) one,1182.781,2.97
conversation about sanctions.,1185.751,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: No, the issue isn&amp;#39;t whether or not --",1186.418,1.335
what he discussed.,1187.753,0.667
"There&amp;#39;s been a complete legal review of that, and",1188.42,1.335
there&amp;#39;s no issue with that.,1189.755,0.801
The issue is whether or not he failed to properly,1190.556,2.569
inform the Vice President -- or not be honest with,1193.125,2.536
"him, or not remember it.",1195.661,1.635
But that&amp;#39;s the plain and simple issue.,1197.296,1.668
"And when he lost trust with the President, that&amp;#39;s",1198.964,2.402
when the President asked,1201.366,0.935
for and received his resignation.,1202.301,1.868
"The Press: Thanks a lot, Sean.",1204.169,2.236
"Yesterday, Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the",1206.405,1.768
"President, said that the President continued to",1208.173,2.069
have trust in General Flynn.,1210.242,1.468
Mr. Spicer: Right.,1211.71,0.868
The Press: What happened between yesterday morning,1212.578,2.068
and yesterday evening that led the President to lose,1214.646,2.67
confidence in General Flynn?,1217.316,1.167
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I&amp;#39;m not going to get into the",1218.483,2.103
"specifics of what the President&amp;#39;s thinking was,",1220.586,1.735
"but I will just say, as I noted in the opening",1222.321,1.635
"statement, that it was",1223.956,1.167
an evolving and eroding process.,1225.123,1.602
"And so at the end of the day, the President made a",1226.725,2.569
"decision, as he does on all subjects, and asked",1229.294,3.437
for and received the national security,1232.731,1.535
advisor&amp;#39;s -- but he is one of those people that we&amp;#39;ve,1234.266,3.003
"noted before -- when he is ready to make a decision,",1237.269,1.902
"he makes it, whether it&amp;#39;s hiring somebody or asking",1239.171,2.536
for someone&amp;#39;s resignation.,1241.707,0.967
Once he has determined that he&amp;#39;s made a decision,1242.674,2.536
"on any subject, that&amp;#39;s when he informs his staff.",1245.21,2.369
"So going into the day, it was an evolving situation.",1247.579,2.903
"He made a determination late in the day, and",1250.482,2.069
he executed on it.,1252.551,1.401
"Yes, Alexis.",1253.952,0.768
"The Press: He&amp;#39;s an extremely loyal person,",1254.72,1.568
General Flynn.,1256.288,0.667
Was it a difficult decision for the President,1256.955,3.037
to let General Flynn go?,1259.992,1.267
"Mr. Spicer: Well, sure.",1261.259,0.668
"I mean, General Flynn is a dedicated public servant.",1261.927,3.136
"He&amp;#39;s headed the DIA, he has been an outstanding",1265.063,4.438
"member of the Army, both as an officer and then",1269.501,2.669
as a flag officer.,1272.17,1.302
He&amp;#39;s served this country admirably.,1273.472,1.935
And I think the President appreciated his service to,1275.407,4.404
"his nation, his commitment to his campaign, and his",1279.811,2.436
service to this country so far.,1282.247,1.802
"But at some point, the decision came down on",1284.049,1.835
whether or not that that trust had eroded.,1285.884,2.603
"The important matters, as I mentioned, that are",1288.487,2.736
before the President when he&amp;#39;s dealing with issues,1291.223,2.969
"of world matters, of all of the issues -- friends",1294.192,2.069
"and allies, foes, hot spots -- he needs to rely",1296.261,3.971
on a national security advisor to give,1300.232,2.436
him sage advice.,1302.668,1.501
"And I think at a certain point, that guidance, that",1304.169,2.436
"trust, eroded.",1306.605,1.201
"And the President, as he does on all matters,",1307.806,1.702
ultimately decides that when he&amp;#39;s ready to make a,1309.508,2.602
"decision, he executes. Alexis.",1312.11,1.335
"The Press: Sean, two questions.",1313.445,1.835
Does the President believe that anything that he,1315.28,3.17
discussed with General Flynn during the,1318.45,2.402
transition might have been construed by the General,1320.852,3.17
as a request or an encouragement to discuss,1324.022,3.17
sanctions with the Russian ambassador?,1327.192,2.002
That&amp;#39;s question number one.,1329.194,1.568
"Mr. Spicer: So -- oh, we&amp;#39;re going to pause.",1330.762,3.737
"So, on the first, again, as I made clear, there&amp;#39;s",1334.499,2.836
nothing that the General did that was a,1337.335,2.169
violation of any sort.,1339.504,1.202
He was well within his duties to discuss issues,1340.706,4.671
of common concern between the two countries.,1345.377,2.169
I will say it again: What this came down to is a,1347.546,2.502
matter of trust.,1350.048,1.435
The President was glad that he was out there,1351.483,2.236
"conducting his job, preparing for his job,",1353.719,2.369
going back and forth with his counterparts,1356.088,2.102
"throughout the world, much as the President had done",1358.19,2.302
with all of these world leaders calling the,1360.492,1.501
"President, congratulating him, looking to set up",1361.993,2.069
calls for him once he was inaugurated.,1364.062,3.37
"Similarly, General Flynn was beginning that process",1367.432,2.136
with his counterparts throughout the world.,1369.568,1.768
"That was never of a concern to the President,",1371.336,1.869
from day one that he was briefed from the,1373.205,1.835
White House Counsel.,1375.04,1.068
"The issue, plain and simple, came down to a",1376.108,1.668
matter of trust.,1377.776,1.368
"And once that occurred, it was over.",1379.144,1.535
"The Press: On question number one, just to",1380.679,3.403
"clarify, the President does not believe that any",1384.082,5.005
discussion that might have taken place -- and we know,1391.757,1.368
"from intel, it did, on sanctions -- creates a",1393.125,1.334
problem for the President in any way -- that that is,1394.459,3.871
"not a problem, that General Flynn discussed",1398.33,2.869
sanctions with the Russians?,1401.199,1.201
"Mr. Spicer: No, there is -- I can&amp;#39;t say",1402.4,3.27
it clearly enough.,1405.67,1.102
"There was nothing in what General Flynn did, in",1406.772,2.902
"terms of conducting himself, that",1409.674,1.702
was an issue.,1411.376,0.667
"What it came down to, plain and simple, was him",1412.043,2.336
"misleading the Vice President and others, and",1414.379,2.236
not having a firm grasp on his recollection of that.,1416.615,2.435
That&amp;#39;s it.,1419.05,0.668
The Press: Question number two.,1419.718,1.935
Lawmakers on Capitol Hill from both sides of the,1421.653,3.337
aisle would like to investigate or probe or,1424.99,2.969
ask more questions about this.,1427.959,1.836
Does the President hope to cooperate with,1429.795,2.602
those investigations?,1432.397,0.734
Would he instruct members of his staff who worked,1433.131,3.303
for him here and in the administration to,1436.434,2.97
cooperate with those investigations?,1439.404,1.468
"Mr. Spicer: Well, we&amp;#39;re",1440.872,1.235
going to comply with the law.,1442.107,1.535
I think the President feels very confident the,1443.642,2.502
review that was conducted by White House Counsel was,1446.144,1.902
very thorough and concluded very,1448.046,1.835
"conclusively, as he had first come to --",1449.881,2.403
instinctively come to the conclusion that there,1452.284,2.102
was nothing wrong.,1454.386,0.801
"So people are free to do what they wish, but I",1455.187,2.836
think that they will find exactly what the President,1458.023,1.902
first believed and what,1459.925,0.834
the White House Counsel concluded.,1460.759,1.468
"And, frankly, I believe a couple publications even",1462.227,2.302
reported that there was no investigation for a reason,1464.529,2.436
"-- because there was not an issue of law, it was",1466.965,2.002
an issue of trust. George.,1468.967,1.969
The Press: When do you expect to have a,1470.936,4.537
replacement in place?,1475.473,2.336
"And secondly, on another topic, there was a report",1477.809,2.936
yesterday that one of your colleagues said the White,1480.745,2.57
House is keeping dossiers on reporters.,1483.315,2.769
Can you say if that&amp;#39;s true or not?,1486.084,2.402
Mr. Spicer: That is absolutely not true.,1488.486,2.236
There are no dossiers being kept.,1490.722,1.935
"It&amp;#39;s just a binder that I put right here,",1492.657,1.535
that&amp;#39;s about it.,1494.192,0.668
That was a joke.,1494.86,3.036
Hold on one second.,1497.896,1.001
"And then, I&amp;#39;m sorry, George, the first part?",1498.897,1.335
The Press: Timetable on a replacement.,1500.232,1.835
Mr. Spicer: Just like the way he handled this,1502.067,2.636
"situation, the President will meet with",1504.703,2.502
"individuals, and when he&amp;#39;s ready to make a decision",1507.205,2.703
and he feels as though the person is qualified and,1509.908,2.903
"can properly advise him on the issue,",1512.811,1.968
he&amp;#39;ll make that decision.,1514.779,0.835
"But that, as all decisions, rests with him.",1515.614,1.768
I&amp;#39;m just going to go to my first Skype seat.,1517.382,2.336
John Huck of WKVVU out of Las Vegas. John.,1519.718,2.969
The Press: Thank you so much on behalf of our,1522.687,3.504
viewers here in Southern Nevada for the opportunity,1526.191,2.803
to join you today.,1528.994,1.501
"As you know, Sean, Las Vegas has suffered",1530.495,2.169
terribly in the last recession -- more so than,1532.664,2.135
perhaps any other city in the country.,1534.799,2.47
As the administration moves forward with,1537.269,1.635
repealing financial regulations and possibly,1538.904,2.202
"rolling back Dodd-Frank, what guarantees can you",1541.106,2.736
make to Nevadans that those actions won&amp;#39;t lead,1543.842,2.436
banks and investments banks to re-engage with,1546.278,2.636
the risky financial behaviors that tanked our,1548.914,2.102
economy the last time and left taxpayers here on the,1551.016,2.602
hook to bail those banks out?,1553.618,1.935
"Mr. Spicer: Thanks, John.",1555.553,1.769
I think one of the things -- if you look at the,1557.322,2.069
"intent of Dodd-Frank, it was to make sure that we",1559.391,2.269
didn&amp;#39;t have institutions that were too big to fail.,1561.66,3.27
"And frankly, it has actually created",1564.93,2.168
institutions that are now too big to fail.,1567.098,2.369
Dodd-Frank actually did exactly the opposite of,1569.467,3.17
what it intended to do.,1572.637,1.435
And I think when you look at the regulation HJR 41,1574.072,2.836
"that the President is signing today, this is",1576.908,3.537
another example of the President taking decisive,1580.445,2.169
"action to roll back regulations that are,",1582.614,3.103
"frankly, creating more of a burden on our nation&amp;#39;s",1585.717,2.436
banks and businesses than helping them.,1588.153,2.068
I think the President is going to be very clear,1590.221,2.303
with making sure that we do things that build up,1592.524,2.102
the goal of what Dodd-Frank actually,1594.626,1.935
intended to do.,1596.561,1.235
"But right now, we actually, through",1597.796,2.435
"Dodd-Frank, put taxpayers more on the hook than we",1600.231,3.037
let them off.,1603.268,0.667
We&amp;#39;ve created more institutions and created,1603.935,2.236
more guarantees for the federal government to bail,1606.171,2.736
out some of these institutions if they,1608.907,2.002
exceed their authority.,1610.909,1.401
John Roberts.,1612.31,0.934
The Press: Let me go back to what you said,1613.244,2.136
at the beginning.,1615.38,0.667
You said the White House Counsel&amp;#39;s Office reviewed,1616.047,2.67
this and determined that there was nothing illegal.,1618.717,2.602
What evidence did they look at in making,1621.319,2.369
this determination?,1623.688,1.402
"And secondly, Democrats up on the Hill say that they",1625.09,3.77
want an investigation of this.,1628.86,1.368
They&amp;#39;re looking into what did the President know and,1630.228,2.97
when did he know it.,1633.198,0.801
So can you tell us what evidence you looked at the,1633.999,2.068
"White House Counsel&amp;#39;s Office, and what did the",1636.067,2.102
President know about all of this and when,1638.169,1.869
was he aware of it?,1640.038,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Well, as I mentioned, the first day",1640.705,1.669
that the Department of Justice made White House,1642.374,2.335
Counsel available -- or sought to notify White,1644.709,3.337
House Counsel was January 26th.,1648.046,1.601
The President was immediately informed,1649.647,1.869
of the situation.,1651.516,1.602
"As I said, based on the information that was",1653.118,1.935
"provided at the time, the view was that this",1655.053,3.303
was not a violation.,1658.356,1.001
He was proved instinctively correct.,1659.357,2.102
And White House Counsel at that time undertook an,1661.459,2.67
extensive review both of materials and questioning --,1664.129,4.104
The Press: Did they -- Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going,1668.233,2.502
to get into the specifics.,1670.735,0.701
"What I will tell you is, on multiple occasions they",1671.436,1.568
had an exhaustive and extensive questioning of,1673.004,4.271
General Flynn on several occasions based on,1677.275,2.803
"information that was provided to them, or",1680.078,2.97
materials that were,1683.048,0.7
provided to them to review.,1683.748,1.535
"I&amp;#39;m not going to get into the details of that, but I",1685.283,2.102
will just say that there was an exhaustive review.,1687.385,2.036
"And again, the thing that&amp;#39;s important to note",1689.421,1.868
"is the Vice President and myself -- in fact, I think",1691.289,3.771
the first time I brought this issue up was January,1695.06,1.868
13 -- the Department of Justice didn&amp;#39;t notify the,1696.928,3.537
White House or the White House Counsel at that time,1700.465,2.269
in the transition phase until 13 days later.,1702.734,3.67
So I think it&amp;#39;s important to understand something,1706.404,1.802
"very, very important: This idea of why did it take so",1708.206,2.569
"long -- I think the first question should be, where",1710.775,2.703
was the Department of Justice in this.,1713.478,1.969
They were aware of this.,1715.447,1.601
We were making statements based on what General,1717.048,1.635
"Flynn was telling us, starting on January 13th.",1718.683,2.936
"The Vice President went out on the 15th, right?",1721.619,2.703
They didn&amp;#39;t notify the White House Counsel&amp;#39;s,1724.322,1.602
Office until January 26th.,1725.924,1.334
"At that time, there was an immediate -- the President",1727.258,3.804
was immediately informed of that and then asked the,1731.062,3.67
"White House Counsel to conduct a very,",1734.732,1.335
very thorough review.,1736.067,0.968
The first part of that review was focused on,1737.035,2.769
whether or not there was any legal issue --,1739.804,2.336
that&amp;#39;s it.,1742.14,0.867
"Once that became the issue, then there was a --",1743.007,2.736
"it shifted into phase two, which is whether or not",1745.743,2.77
there was trust still maintained.,1748.513,1.969
Then that became a separate set of issues,1750.482,2.636
that were -- The Press: I understand.,1753.118,1.368
"I&amp;#39;m speaking to the actual evidence, that the FBI has",1754.486,2.669
"transcripts of these intercepts, which I assume",1757.155,3.537
were done by the NSA via a FISA Court order.,1760.692,3.97
Was there any communication between the,1764.662,1.335
White House Counsel&amp;#39;s Office and the FBI?,1765.997,1.535
Did those transcripts ever enter -- Mr. Spicer: I,1767.532,2.069
will say that obviously -- there was obviously,1769.601,2.002
communication between the Department of Justice and,1771.603,1.768
the White House Counsel&amp;#39;s Office.,1773.371,1.435
I&amp;#39;m not going to get into the specific,1774.806,1.368
nature of that.,1776.174,0.667
I think it would be inappropriate because of,1776.841,1.902
the nature of the information that was,1778.743,1.769
being discussed. Yes.,1780.512,0.9
The Press: Why not dismiss the General,1781.412,2.937
on January 27th?,1784.349,1.835
"Why, if the question was of trust, and immediately",1786.184,4.972
"you have on the 15th, he&amp;#39;s on &amp;quot;Face the Nation&amp;quot;",1791.156,2.102
saying that -- the Vice President on &amp;quot;Face the,1793.258,2.435
Nation&amp;quot; saying that this is what General Flynn told,1795.693,2.503
"me, and then January 26th you hear the opposite --",1798.196,2.769
why not immediately act?,1800.965,1.101
Why wait another two and a half weeks?,1802.066,1.335
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t understand how that&amp;#39;s,1803.401,1.535
a due process.,1804.936,0.834
Because what the -- the Attorney General didn&amp;#39;t,1805.77,1.769
come -- the Acting Attorney General -- come,1807.539,2.936
in and say that there was an issue.,1810.475,1.334
"She said, we wanted to give you a head&amp;#39;s up that",1811.809,1.836
"there may be information, okay?",1813.645,2.202
She could not confirm there,1815.847,1.702
was an investigation.,1817.549,1.067
And so it would be unbelievably short-sighted,1818.616,2.336
and wrong to go in and dismiss,1820.952,1.802
someone immediately.,1822.754,1.001
"In fact, what the President did was take",1823.755,1.401
decisive action to make sure that the White House,1825.156,2.336
Counsel thoroughly reviewed and vetted,1827.492,2.469
the situation.,1829.961,0.734
"He took immediate, decisive action.",1830.695,2.636
And if you look at the timeline in terms of what,1833.331,2.069
"he did and how that expanded, the White House",1835.4,2.335
Counsel&amp;#39;s first and foremost goal was to make,1837.735,1.969
sure that there was not a legal issue at hand.,1839.704,2.703
"Once that was concluded, then it became a phase of",1842.407,2.836
determining whether or not the General&amp;#39;s action on,1845.243,3.637
this and a whole host of other issues undermined,1848.88,2.602
his trust in the President.,1851.482,2.837
"But the President, from day one, from minute one,",1854.319,2.969
was unbelievably decisive in asking for and,1857.288,2.836
demanding that his White House Counsel and their,1860.124,1.769
"team review the situation, first and foremost, to",1861.893,2.669
question whether it&amp;#39;s a legal issue.,1864.562,1.335
And what they immediately determined -- not,1865.897,2.002
"immediately, but within several days, was that,",1867.899,2.903
"after review, that there was not a legal issue, and",1870.802,2.636
then it moved into a second phase. Mara.,1873.438,1.735
The Press: So wait -- because the President,1875.173,2.936
tweeted this morning that the real story is leaks --,1878.109,3.437
illegal leaks.,1881.546,0.667
Mr. Spicer: It is leaks.,1882.213,0.701
But if you think about this -- understand that,1882.914,2.002
all of this information was leaked.,1884.916,2.602
"I mean, I got to -- and again, I know we&amp;#39;ve got me",1887.518,2.737
"lecturing you about what the story should be, but I",1890.255,2.369
think that there&amp;#39;s a real story here.,1892.624,1.635
"The idea that not just in this administration, but",1894.259,2.635
the Obama administration going back to the Bush,1896.894,1.702
"administration and back, that we have an issue",1898.596,1.869
"where classified information, of which this",1900.465,1.868
"would be, is handled in such a way that it is",1902.333,2.97
being given out.,1905.303,1.001
"And I know in some cases it&amp;#39;s a good story, and I",1906.304,2.869
"understand that, and that&amp;#39;s to some degree your",1909.173,1.602
responsibility to write that.,1910.775,1.768
"But I think there&amp;#39;s also a story here, with the",1912.543,2.002
amount of leaks that are coming out of people that,1914.545,2.236
are entrusted with national security secrets,1916.781,2.569
and classified information are leaking it out.,1919.35,3.304
That&amp;#39;s a real concern for this President; that when,1922.654,2.569
"he&amp;#39;s talking on the phone with a world leader, that",1925.223,2.369
when he&amp;#39;s making key decisions that are in the,1927.592,1.835
"interest of protecting this country, that we have",1929.427,2.369
to wonder whether or not people who work for our,1931.796,2.536
"government, who are entrusted with classified",1934.332,2.602
information and decision-based materials,1936.934,2.803
are leaking that information out.,1939.737,2.303
"That, I do believe, is a big story that",1942.04,2.502
should be reported.,1944.542,0.801
"I also believe that the President is, rightly so,",1945.343,2.569
"very, very concerned about this, because it&amp;#39;s not",1947.912,2.903
just something that is plaguing the current,1950.815,2.87
"situation, but it goes back through the Obama",1953.685,1.601
"administration, the Bush administration, the",1955.286,1.635
Clinton administration.,1956.921,1.201
When we have government employees that are,1958.122,2.169
"entrusted with this and then leak it out, that",1960.291,3.604
"undermines our national security, frankly. Trey.",1963.895,2.102
"The Press: Hold on -- Mr. Spicer: Sorry, I",1965.997,3.136
"apologize, Mara.",1969.133,0.901
The Press: I know you just forgot.,1970.034,3.203
"I have a question, but I want you to clarify",1973.237,1.769
something you just said to John.,1975.006,1.802
Are you saying that no one has read the transcripts,1976.808,2.102
"of the calls, or you just don&amp;#39;t want to tell us",1978.91,1.435
whether they -- Mr. Spicer: I said that,1980.345,1.334
I&amp;#39;m not going to comment on it.,1981.679,0.701
The Press: Okay.,1982.38,0.667
So my question is about sanctions.,1983.047,1.368
You were very specific in talking about the,1984.415,2.002
sanctions against Crimea and that he doesn&amp;#39;t want,1986.417,1.802
to lift them until Crimea is returned.,1988.219,1.535
But the sanctions that Flynn was discussing were,1989.754,2.202
the sanctions for the election hacking.,1991.956,1.635
Mr. Spicer: Right.,1993.591,0.801
The Press: That&amp;#39;s something the President,1994.392,1.635
could remove on his own if he wanted to.,1996.027,2.469
Is he committed to keeping those?,1998.496,1.635
Mr. Spicer: I think Secretary Mnuchin,2000.131,2.002
commented on that.,2002.133,0.701
There&amp;#39;s no change in our current sanctions strategy,2002.834,2.836
"with Russia, and I&amp;#39;ve got nothing for you on that. Trey.",2005.67,3.336
"The Press: Given that the current story is leaks,",2009.006,2.737
what is the President willing to do to,2011.743,1.868
investigate further to determine where these,2013.611,1.335
leaks are coming from?,2014.946,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, again, I think this goes back to",2015.613,1.535
the same way he negotiates.,2017.148,1.835
Telling people what we&amp;#39;re going to do to cover up,2018.983,1.802
additional leaks wouldn&amp;#39;t be a very sound strategy,2020.785,2.636
when it comes to making sure that that doesn&amp;#39;t,2023.421,1.702
happen again.,2025.123,0.667
"The President has been very clear, whether he&amp;#39;s",2025.79,1.501
"negotiating or dealing with an issue like this,",2027.291,2.103
you don&amp;#39;t telegraph to people how you&amp;#39;re,2029.394,1.434
going to handle it.,2030.828,0.834
"The Press: Sean -- Mr. Spicer: Hold on, Trey",2031.662,2.903
gets a follow-up.,2034.565,0.935
Everyone else got one.,2035.5,1.201
The Press: So he is going to take some sort of steps,2036.701,2.369
to investigate these leaks that the administration --,2039.07,3.203
"Mr. Spicer: I would just say that the President, as",2042.273,2.002
"I said, is clearly upset about this.",2044.275,1.335
He understands the threat that they pose to our,2045.61,1.334
"national security, and he&amp;#39;s going to make sure",2046.944,1.402
that he continues to take action to make,2048.346,2.035
sure that that stops. Yes.,2050.381,1.635
The Press: Thank you.,2052.016,2.403
So you&amp;#39;ve mentioned time and time again that this,2054.419,2.902
is an issue of trust.,2057.321,1.335
"You also said that it was an evolving issue, and",2058.656,2.803
that the issue of the trust that the President,2061.459,3.403
had for Flynn came down to this deception that,2064.862,3.27
happened with the Vice President but also a host,2068.132,3.27
of whole other -- of other issues.,2071.402,2.636
What were the other issues?,2074.038,1.168
And was the Vice President the only person that was,2075.206,2.469
misled by Flynn?,2077.675,1.235
Were other people misled?,2078.91,1.268
"Mr. Spicer: I mean, I think I&amp;#39;ve stood before",2080.178,1.901
you before and explained what General Flynn had,2082.079,2.67
conveyed to me.,2084.749,0.667
I think there were some others that he had,2085.416,1.335
"similarly expressed that to, as well.",2086.751,2.469
"So that&amp;#39;s why it&amp;#39;s others, because it wasn&amp;#39;t just",2089.22,3.303
people who went out and made public pronouncements,2092.523,1.568
and a series of questioning that was,2094.091,2.236
rather exhaustive over a long period of time.,2096.327,2.569
He continued to maintain that that had not,2098.896,2.002
"occurred, and I think that&amp;#39;s where the President",2100.898,2.937
continued to -- and that&amp;#39;s why the President was very,2103.835,2.769
clear that it was an eroding issue.,2106.604,2.169
Because it was after a series of issues and a,2108.773,3.303
series of statements and pronouncements that the,2112.076,2.069
President came to that conclusion.,2114.145,1.368
The Press: Were there other issues outside of,2115.513,2.269
this call and the deception over that that,2117.782,3.704
led to the mistrust with Flynn?,2121.486,2.469
Mr. Spicer: I think the statement is very clear,2123.955,2.168
that it was this and a series of issues.,2126.123,2.303
"With that, let me go to Jason Stevens of the",2128.426,2.035
"Federalist Paper in Ashland, Ohio.",2130.461,1.335
The Press: Thank you.,2131.796,2.069
What our readers at the Federalist Papers Project,2133.865,2.836
are most interested in is returning the country to,2136.701,3.637
the first principles of republican government as,2140.338,2.736
understood by the American Founders.,2143.074,2.369
"One of those principles, in the Declaration of",2145.443,2.369
"Independence, is the consent of the governed.",2147.812,3.203
So my question is this: What are the President&amp;#39;s,2151.015,2.903
future plans for rolling back the expensive and,2153.918,3.67
"burdensome regulations of the administrative state,",2157.588,2.836
"most of which are the product of unelected,",2160.424,3.137
unaccountable bureaucrats who never received the,2163.561,2.135
"consent of the governed to do anything, let",2165.696,3.337
alone make law?,2169.033,1.101
"Mr. Spicer: Thanks, Jason.",2170.134,1.268
"I think, as I mentioned today, the President, in",2171.402,1.802
"just a few minutes, is going to be signing HJR",2173.204,1.968
"41, which is one of those attempts to roll back some",2175.172,3.371
onerous Dodd-Frank regulations with respect,2178.543,1.968
to the SEC in particular.,2180.511,1.969
He is going to continue -- last week we rolled out,2182.48,4.438
another one of those executive orders that,2186.918,2.469
"ensures that for every new regulation, two must be",2189.387,2.536
gotten rid of.,2191.923,0.667
The President&amp;#39;s commitment to rolling back regulation,2192.59,2.035
"and the overreach of government, I think, is",2194.625,1.869
unwavering and unquestionable.,2196.494,1.301
So you&amp;#39;re going to continue to see this,2197.795,1.502
President undo a lot of that government overreach. Jim.,2199.297,3.47
"The Press: Yeah, just a quick question.",2202.767,2.369
You said earlier in your comments that the,2205.136,2.335
President has been incredibly tough on Russia.,2207.471,3.37
How is that possible?,2210.841,1.335
He has made comment after comment over the course of,2212.176,2.836
"the campaign, the transition, where he",2215.012,2.069
defended Vladimir Putin.,2217.081,1.768
"He had an interview with Bill O&amp;#39;Reilly where he,",2218.849,2.303
when he was asked if Vladimir Putin is a,2221.152,3.236
"killer, he said, well, America hasn&amp;#39;t been that",2224.388,3.037
much better in this regard also.,2227.425,1.902
"To me it seems, and I think to a lot of",2229.327,1.368
Americans it seems that this President has not,2230.695,1.801
been tough on Russia.,2232.496,0.768
How can you say that?,2233.264,1.101
Mr. Spicer: Because I just walked through it.,2234.365,1.435
I think there&amp;#39;s a difference between the,2235.8,1.401
President wanting to have an understanding of how a,2237.201,3.103
good relationship with Russia can help us defeat,2240.304,3.704
ISIS and terrorism throughout the world.,2244.008,2.069
"Look, the Obama administration tried to",2246.077,1.568
have a reset with Russia.,2247.645,1.301
They failed.,2248.946,1.068
They tried to tell Russia not to invade Crimea.,2250.014,2.736
They failed.,2252.75,1.034
This President understands that it&amp;#39;s in America&amp;#39;s,2253.784,1.802
national and economic interests to have a,2255.586,2.803
healthy relationship.,2258.389,1.101
If he has a great relationship with Putin in,2259.49,2.002
"Russia, great.",2261.492,0.934
"If he doesn&amp;#39;t, then he&amp;#39;ll continue on.",2262.426,2.169
But he&amp;#39;s not going to just assume that because it,2264.595,2.169
wasn&amp;#39;t able to happen in the past -- I think you&amp;#39;ve,2266.764,2.069
"seen, with Prime Minister Abe in particular and",2268.833,2.002
"others, that the reset that Prime Minister",2270.835,3.837
Netanyahu talked about tomorrow -- so many of,2274.672,2.769
these countries from around the globe are,2277.441,2.002
looking forward to resetting the,2279.443,1.335
relationships that this country has with them;,2280.778,1.969
that they feel as though they were abandoned over,2282.747,1.835
"the last eight years, and that they are excited",2284.582,2.035
about the prospect of a new U.S.,2286.617,1.468
relationship under a Trump administration.,2288.085,1.335
"But with respect to Russia, I think the",2289.42,1.335
comments that Ambassador Haley made at the U.N.,2290.755,1.334
were extremely forceful and very clear that until,2292.089,1.335
"-- The Press: That was an announcement from Haley,",2293.424,1.335
not the President.,2294.759,0.7
Mr. Spicer: She speaks for the President.,2295.459,1.335
I speak for the President.,2296.794,0.667
All of us in this administration.,2297.461,1.335
And so all of the actions and all of the words in,2298.796,5.439
this administration are on behalf and at the,2304.235,5.439
direction of this President.,2309.674,1.735
So I don&amp;#39;t think we could be any clearer on the,2311.409,2.369
President&amp;#39;s commitment.,2313.778,0.667
Katie Pavlich.,2314.445,0.867
"The Press: Quick little follow-up, because I",2315.312,1.569
haven&amp;#39;t had any follow-ups or questions in a while.,2316.881,3.036
But anyway -- Mr. Spicer: Really?,2319.917,1.869
"The Press: No -- the other question is, just getting",2321.786,3.103
back to what was asked a few moments ago about,2324.889,3.136
trust and being misled.,2328.025,1.335
Are you saying that the national security advisor,2329.36,2.602
"was intentionally misleading the President,",2331.962,2.903
"the Vice President, yourself when he made",2334.865,2.203
these comments to you about that conversation?,2337.068,3.036
"Mr. Spicer: No, look, the trust is given",2340.104,1.835
by the President.,2341.939,0.701
It&amp;#39;s a relationship between he,2342.64,1.468
and any individual.,2344.108,1.201
"And so, as I mentioned in the comments, maybe it was",2345.309,3.437
"because -- I don&amp;#39;t know that it was intentional,",2348.746,1.768
"he may have just forgotten, but I think at",2350.514,1.368
some point trust isn&amp;#39;t just -- The Press: Isn&amp;#39;t,2351.882,2.57
"that kind of a weird thing to forget, though, in a",2354.452,1.901
conversation where you talk about -- Mr. Spicer:,2356.353,1.369
"But that&amp;#39;s the point, Jim, is that at some point that",2357.722,1.334
trust eroded to a point where the President did,2359.056,2.469
not feel comfortable with him serving in that,2361.525,2.102
"position, and asked for and received",2363.627,1.869
his resignation.,2365.496,0.667
Katie Pavlich.,2366.163,0.701
"The Press: Sean, on the trust issue and the",2366.864,2.836
"eroding of trust, last night, in General Flynn&amp;#39;s",2369.7,2.503
"resignation letter, he said he inadvertently",2372.203,1.868
briefed the Vice President-elect and others,2374.071,1.869
with incomplete information.,2375.94,0.934
Mr. Spicer: Right.,2376.874,0.934
The Press: Considering his role in advising the,2377.808,2.536
"President on national security matters, is the",2380.344,2.169
White House concerned that he maybe briefed the,2382.513,2.502
"President-elect, Vice President-elect with",2385.015,1.368
incomplete information on other matters of national,2386.383,2.937
security in addition to his phone calls with the,2389.32,1.802
Russian ambassador?,2391.122,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Well, when you look at the team, it&amp;#39;s not",2391.789,2.869
"one person in isolation, Katie.",2394.658,1.702
It&amp;#39;s several.,2396.36,0.667
You&amp;#39;ve got General Kelly on the homeland security,2397.027,2.436
"front, General Mattis on the DOD front -- he&amp;#39;s got",2399.463,2.569
an entire national security staff and,2402.032,2.47
"apparatus that briefs him -- you know, Director",2404.502,3.503
"Pompeo at the CIA, and others from the DNI&amp;#39;s",2408.005,3.47
office that come in and brief him on a whole,2411.475,1.468
host of issues.,2412.943,0.668
So it&amp;#39;s not a single position.,2413.611,2.002
The Press: So was his situation an isolated,2415.613,1.635
incident of giving incomplete --,2417.248,1.334
"Mr. Spicer: Well, yeah.",2418.582,1.035
"Regardless of whether it&amp;#39;s a single situation, it&amp;#39;s",2419.617,2.135
not as though there&amp;#39;s one person briefing him.,2421.752,2.603
And the President synthesizes a lot of,2424.355,1.935
"information, both written and stuff that is briefed",2426.29,2.402
"to him, and ultimately it is he who makes that",2428.692,2.002
"decision based a lot on what he already knows,",2430.694,2.503
what he is presented with.,2433.197,1.068
So the President gets information from a lot of,2434.265,3.47
"people -- generals, admirals, people in the",2437.735,1.968
"military community, ambassadors, people in the",2439.703,1.836
"State Department, an exhaustive team at the",2441.539,2.435
"National Security Council, and then makes an ultimate",2443.974,2.303
decision based on that and what he already,2446.277,1.701
knows to be the case.,2447.978,0.835
"The Press: Sean, you&amp;#39;ve been asked a couple times",2448.813,4.804
about these transcripts of calls.,2453.617,2.67
Will the White House declassify those,2456.287,3.203
and release them?,2459.49,1.601
"Mr. Spicer: Looks, it is inappropriate for me to",2461.091,3.604
comment on those at this time.,2464.695,2.603
"Right now, the focus is on some of the evolving",2467.298,2.702
"issues that were going around the globe,",2470,2.536
as you know.,2472.536,0.668
The Press: Will you be open to it?,2473.204,1.368
Mr. Spicer: Let me answer the question.,2474.572,1.334
It is not an issue that has come up.,2475.906,1.669
I think the President right now is focused on,2477.575,2.702
"replacing his national security advisor, making",2480.277,1.869
sure that he&amp;#39;s presented with the best possible,2482.146,1.501
information to make these key decisions.,2483.647,2.036
"But at this time, we also have got to be careful",2485.683,3.236
that we were not involving ourselves in a matter of,2488.919,2.236
national security.,2491.155,0.867
"And the review, as I mentioned, was done and",2492.022,2.703
then immediately last night when the President,2494.725,1.869
"felt as though it was time for a decision, made it.",2496.594,1.901
That&amp;#39;s where we are in this iteration,2498.495,2.536
of the process.,2501.031,1.101
"If we have anything further for you,",2502.132,1.335
we will update you.,2503.467,0.968
I want to go to Joyce Kaufman of WFTL Talk News,2504.435,3.336
"in Palm Beach, Florida.",2507.771,0.801
The Press: Thank you so much for this opportunity.,2508.572,3.237
I&amp;#39;m approximately six miles away from Mar-a-Lago,2511.809,3.07
"right now, and the President met with Prime",2514.879,3.069
Minister Abe from Japan at Mar-a-Lago this weekend.,2517.948,3.938
And besides giving us traffic and security,2521.886,2.402
"nightmares, there were apparently conversations",2524.288,2.636
that took place by telephone and with the,2526.924,3.17
Prime Minister that were in a relatively,2530.094,2.335
insecure dining area.,2532.429,1.902
There is already video of this surfacing.,2534.331,2.803
Will there be a SCIF put in place in these dining,2537.134,2.736
"areas, these public places?",2539.87,1.802
And one last question.,2541.672,1.501
When he meets with Prime Minister Netanyahu,2543.173,1.902
"tomorrow, will they be discussing moving the",2545.075,2.369
"embassy, and settlements?",2547.444,1.869
"Mr. Spicer: On the second one, I&amp;#39;m not going to get",2549.313,2.269
ahead of the Prime Minister&amp;#39;s discussion,2551.582,1.568
with the President.,2553.15,0.868
We&amp;#39;ll have a readout.,2554.018,1.301
"After that, there will be a press conference.",2555.319,2.636
"With respect to the first, there is a SCIF",2557.955,1.501
at Mar-a-Lago.,2559.456,1.101
"And just to be clear, the briefing -- the President",2560.557,3.671
was briefed in a SCIF ahead of dinner.,2564.228,2.369
He went with his national security team.,2566.597,2.569
They briefed him on the situation in North Korea.,2569.166,1.869
"Subsequently, he had a dinner, of which was",2571.035,3.036
attended exclusively by U.S.,2574.071,2.102
and Japanese delegation members.,2576.173,2.169
"At that time, apparently there was a photo taken,",2578.342,2.869
which everyone jumped to nefarious conclusions,2581.211,1.936
about what may or may not be discussed.,2583.147,1.768
There was simply a discussion about press,2584.915,1.435
"logistics, where to host the event.",2586.35,1.935
"And then after the dinner, the President went back",2588.285,2.036
into the SCIF to get a further update,2590.321,2.035
from his team.,2592.356,1.134
So I&amp;#39;m not really sure where people jumped,2593.49,2.002
to conclusions.,2595.492,0.668
There is a SCIF there.,2596.16,1.067
It was utilized on two occasions that evening to,2597.227,2.336
convey to the President by his national security team,2599.563,2.436
the situation in North Korea.,2601.999,1.601
And then the President subsequently stood,2603.6,1.469
shoulder to shoulder with the Japanese President to,2605.069,2.602
make sure that our commitment to their,2607.671,1.902
security and stand against North Korea,2609.573,2.136
was fully made aware. Margaret.,2611.709,2.035
"The Press: Sean, can you just clarify, because I",2613.744,2.636
"got a little turned around -- did President Trump, or",2616.38,3.203
"President-elect Trump at the time, know of General",2619.583,3.837
Flynn&amp;#39;s discussion of the sanctions while he was,2623.42,3.504
NSC-designate?,2626.924,0.667
"And if not, when did he finally learn about them?",2627.591,4.838
"And if so, why was he okay with that?",2632.429,4.538
"Mr. Spicer: So, no, he was not aware, as he&amp;#39;s not",2636.967,3.437
back-briefed on every conversation that his,2640.404,2.502
national security team has or other staffers.,2642.906,2.036
"They were performing their duties, as other people",2644.942,2.869
"were in terms of getting up to speed, conveying",2647.811,2.436
with counterparts and previous members,2650.247,2.703
of their team.,2652.95,1.735
"That being said, when he was made aware of it, once",2654.685,3.97
the White House Counsel briefed him on concerns,2658.655,1.769
"the Department of Justice had -- and at that point,",2660.424,2.202
"as I mentioned, what he asked and what he believed",2662.626,2.269
at the time and was confirmed by White House,2664.895,1.468
Counsel was that there was no legal issue here.,2666.363,2.636
Discussing the issue didn&amp;#39;t violate anything;,2668.999,2.469
it was appropriate in the normal course of action,2671.468,2.269
to discuss that.,2673.737,0.968
And he immediately asked the White House Counsel to,2674.705,1.868
further confirm what his,2676.573,1.435
instincts were at the time.,2678.008,1.135
"Thank you, guys.",2679.143,1.001
Have a great one.,2680.144,0.734
We&amp;#39;ve got everybody for a bill signing.,2680.878,1.401
We&amp;#39;ve got a bill signing.,2682.279,1.268
The Press: I didn&amp;#39;t get my --,2683.547,2.102
"Mr. Spicer: Oh, he&amp;#39;s got --",2685.649,1.769
"Margaret gets a follow-up, but he&amp;#39;s got --",2687.418,2.369
The Press: Are you -- is the administration,2689.787,2.369
"undertaking any sort of effort, either",2692.156,1.801
"Cabinet-wide or, like, inside the shop to make",2693.957,2.369
sure that everyone comes forward who had any,2696.326,2.47
communications with the Russians about sanctions,2698.796,1.468
or otherwise?,2700.264,0.667
Mr. Spicer: There&amp;#39;s no other information.,2700.931,1.435
"I mean, as far as we are aware, that is an isolated",2702.366,3.77
incident that occurred.,2706.136,0.935
"And again, the key point in this isn&amp;#39;t that there",2707.071,3.436
were discussions.,2710.507,0.634
There was nothing wrong or inappropriate,2711.141,1.702
about those discussions.,2712.843,1.401
It purely came down to a matter of trust.,2714.244,1.702
That&amp;#39;s it.,2715.946,0.734
"Thank you, guys.",2716.68,0.501
See you tomorrow.,2717.181,0.5
Happy Valentine&amp;#39;s Day.,2717.681,1.301
