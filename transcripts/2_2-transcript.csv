Happy Groundhog Day.,2.235,2.236
"We&amp;#39;ve got six more weeks of winter, apparently.",4.471,2.802
"Luckily, for those of you who are going to be",7.273,1.569
"joining the President down to Florida this weekend,",8.842,2.269
you&amp;#39;ll get some time to get a glimpse of summer at,11.111,3.103
the &amp;quot;Winter White House&amp;quot; in Mar-a-Lago.,14.214,1.501
The President is going to start his meeting,15.715,1.969
at 1:00 sharp.,17.684,1.568
You probably just saw the b-roll of folks from,19.252,1.768
"Harley rolling on in, literally.",21.02,2.069
"So, I&amp;#39;m going to try to keep this a little quick.",23.089,2.736
The President signed a proclamation yesterday,25.825,2.536
ushering in Black History Month.,28.361,2.002
He looks forward to an engaging and informative,30.363,2.336
month of events honoring the enormous contributions,32.699,3.003
that African Americans have made,35.702,1.334
throughout our history.,37.036,1.369
"Last night, the President was honored to host the",38.405,2.435
"swearing-in of the next Secretary of State, Rex",40.84,2.603
"Tillerson, in the Oval Office.",43.443,2.069
"As the President said last night, Secretary Tillerson",45.512,2.235
is a man who&amp;#39;s already respected all over the,47.747,1.802
"world for the tremendous life that he&amp;#39;s led, and",49.549,3.37
now will bring his years of experience to the,52.919,2.569
"critical task of making our nation more safer,",55.488,2.836
"more prosperous, and more secure.",58.324,2.703
It&amp;#39;s time to bring a clear-eyed focus to our,61.027,2.136
"foreign affairs, and now with Secretary Tillerson",63.163,2.469
"at the helm of the State Department, we&amp;#39;ll",65.632,1.802
do just that.,67.434,1.401
"We&amp;#39;ll strengthen our alliances, form new ones,",68.835,2.169
and enhance America&amp;#39;s interests throughout,71.004,2.436
the world.,73.44,1.067
Speaking of the President&amp;#39;s excellent,74.507,1.402
"nominees, praise is pouring in from around the",75.909,2.168
country for his pick for Supreme Court.,78.077,2.77
The Detroit News said Judge Gorsuch is a &amp;quot;legal,80.847,2.869
"superstar&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;an outstanding choice,&amp;quot; says",83.716,2.369
the New Hampshire Union Leader.,86.085,1.669
The Richmond Dispatch says the &amp;quot;initial reaction&amp;quot; was,87.754,2.502
&amp;quot;to cheer.&amp;quot;,90.256,1.101
The South Florida Sun Sentinel touted his,91.357,2.036
&amp;quot;excellent qualifications.&amp;quot;,93.393,2.135
"Yesterday, Judge Gorsuch had his first round of",95.528,2.436
meetings on the Hill.,97.964,1.235
"Unfortunately, Senate offices aren&amp;#39;t in the",99.199,2.102
"habit of releasing editorials, but from",101.301,2.569
"everything we heard, the Judge knocked it out of",103.87,1.868
the park on the Senate as well.,105.738,2.336
The President looks forward to a fair and,108.074,1.702
speedy confirmation process for this,109.776,2.069
exceedingly qualified nominee and jurist.,111.845,3.003
"In my last briefing, I read out a list of the",114.848,2.302
senators Judge Gorsuch met with.,117.15,1.902
In addition to the meeting with Majority Leader,119.052,1.568
"McConnell, Majority Whip Cornyn, Judiciary Chair",120.62,2.97
"Grassley, and Sen.",123.59,1.668
"Hatch and Gardner, the Judge also met with",125.258,1.902
Democratic Sen.,127.16,0.767
Joe Manchin of West Virginia.,127.927,2.202
"Recently, Sen.",130.129,0.768
Manchin expressed his belief that Judge Gorsuch,130.897,2.002
could win enough Democrats to hit 60 votes.,132.899,3.57
I&amp;#39;ll agree with the Senator there on that one.,136.469,1.835
"I mean, we have to have a few Trump-state Democrats",138.304,2.67
who want to win re-election.,140.974,1.268
"But, as I pointed out yesterday, this so-called",142.242,3.336
60 vote &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; is simply not accurate.,145.578,2.469
Democrats are grasping at straws to block the,148.047,2.636
confirmation of an unquestionably,150.683,1.702
qualified nominee.,152.385,1.435
"I&amp;#39;ll repeat, neither of the two Supreme Court",153.82,1.935
justices that President Obama put forward were,155.755,2.703
subject to the 60-vote threshold.,158.458,2.035
"So, although I agree with Sen.",160.493,1.235
"Manchin that Judge Gorsuch will probably get 60,",161.728,3.136
"enough Democrats to get to 60, it&amp;#39;s just simply not",164.864,3.337
ever been a requirement.,168.201,1.768
"Now, on to the events of today.",169.969,1.135
The President started his day by attending the,171.104,1.968
National Prayer Breakfast.,173.072,1.035
"It was a, It&amp;#39;s a tradition that continued over six",174.107,1.468
"decades, going back to President Eisenhower.",175.575,4.571
The President thanked the American people for their,180.146,1.502
faith and prayers that have sustained and,181.648,2.335
"inspired him, noting that the five words that he has",183.983,2.67
heard more than any others as he&amp;#39;s traveled,186.653,1.601
"throughout the country are, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m",188.254,2.069
praying for you.&amp;quot;,190.323,1.401
He spoke at length about the ISIS genocide against,191.724,2.736
Christians and the oppression of peace-loving,194.46,2.436
"Muslims, as well as the threats of extermination",196.896,2.936
"against the Jewish people, and made it clear that he",199.832,2.236
believes the United States has a moral obligation to,202.068,2.703
speak out against such violence.,204.771,2.102
He encouraged Americans to remain a tolerant society,206.873,2.602
where all faiths are respected and where all of,209.475,2.303
our citizens can feel safe and secure.,211.778,2.702
"With that goal in mind, the President remarked",214.48,1.802
that he&amp;#39;s taken action to ensure that the United,216.282,1.935
States will not allow a beachhead of intolerance,218.217,3.671
to spread throughout our nation.,221.888,2.402
"In the coming days, we will develop a system to",224.29,1.735
help ensure that those admitted into our country,226.025,2.469
fully embrace our values of religious and personal,228.494,2.403
liberty and reject any form of oppression,230.897,2.769
or discrimination.,233.666,1.602
The President also committed to get rid of,235.268,1.702
the Johnson Amendment and allowing our,236.97,1.501
representatives of faith to speak freely and,238.471,3.17
without retribution.,241.641,0.834
"In a particularly poignant moment during his remarks,",242.475,3.904
the President recalled yesterday his visit to,246.379,1.935
Dover Air Force Base to join the family of Chief,248.314,2.803
Ryan Owens as America&amp;#39;s fallen hero,251.117,2.903
was returned home.,254.02,1.435
After honoring Chief Owens for giving his life in,255.455,2.235
"defense of the American people, the President",257.69,2.469
quoted John 15:13: &amp;quot;Greater love hath no man,260.159,3.604
than this: that a man lay down his life,263.763,2.769
for his friends.&amp;quot;,266.532,1.836
"After returning to the White House this morning,",268.368,2.102
the President held a legislative affairs staff,270.47,2.435
meeting in the Oval Office with his team.,272.905,2.369
The team continues to work closely with Congress to,275.274,1.836
enact the President&amp;#39;s agenda.,277.11,1.568
With the nomination of Judge Gorsuch to the,278.678,2.269
"Supreme Court, extensive outreach is underway on",280.947,2.235
Capitol Hill and we look forward to the Judge,283.182,2.903
receiving a swift and fair hearing.,286.085,2.303
"Between his meetings, the President was pleased to",288.388,1.635
see that EPA Administrator-designee,290.023,1.635
Pruitt was voted out of the Senate Environment and,291.658,1.735
Public Works Committee.,293.393,1.368
"As has unfortunately become the practice,",294.761,1.868
"Democrats again boycotted the hearing, requiring a",296.629,3.504
suspension of the rules in order to,300.133,1.735
advance his nomination.,301.868,1.735
"Following the strategy session, the",303.603,1.368
President met with Sen.,304.971,1.101
"Hatch, Wyden and Congressmen",306.072,1.635
Brady and Neal.,307.707,1.134
This meeting was an opportunity for the,308.841,1.702
President to meet with the chairmen and ranking,310.543,1.768
members of the Senate Finance Committee and the,312.311,1.969
House Ways and Means Committee to help chart,314.28,2.202
the future of,316.482,0.668
U.S. trade policy.,317.15,1.501
The President has put together an all-star trade,318.651,1.869
team that will work closely with the U.S.,320.52,1.935
Trade Representative and the committees led by,322.455,1.668
these members to craft new trade deals.,324.123,2.803
The President has expressed his concern time,326.926,1.802
"and again with NAFTA, which he believes is an",328.728,2.369
out-of-date agreement.,331.097,1.368
The ultimate goal is to ensure the best and,332.465,2.069
fairest treatment of U.S.,334.534,1.334
"workers and businesses, and the President believes",335.868,2.236
"that those interests are best secured by bilateral,",338.104,2.97
rather than multilateral trade deals.,341.074,3.336
He looks forward to working closely with the,344.41,1.468
USTR and Congress when it comes to issues of trade.,345.878,3.537
For those of you who weren&amp;#39;t outside and just,349.415,1.368
"saw the Harleys roll up, it&amp;#39;s no surprise that this",350.783,2.336
afternoon the President will host a meeting and,353.119,1.702
listening session with Harley-Davidson executives,354.821,2.669
and union representatives.,357.49,2.336
"For a list of those individuals, please",359.826,1.635
contact our office.,361.461,1.534
Harley-Davidson has been an American success story,362.995,2.169
"since 1901, when William S.",365.164,1.602
"Harley, at age 21, completed the blueprint",366.766,3.57
drawing of an engine designed to fit,370.336,1.368
into a bicycle.,371.704,0.701
"In 1903, Harley-Davidson began building motorcycles",372.405,3.103
in the United States.,375.508,1.268
"And today, the company has approximately 6,000",376.776,2.502
employees and $6 billion in annual revenue.,379.278,3.137
The company&amp;#39;s global headquarters is located in,382.415,2.102
"Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- which may have had",384.517,2.169
something to do with them getting in so quickly.,386.686,1.868
And there&amp;#39;s a certain staffer.,388.554,1.835
"Today, the President will welcome to the White House",390.389,1.802
the latest generation of Harley-Davidson executives,392.191,2.202
to discuss how to make it easier for businesses to,394.393,2.403
create more jobs and factories in the,396.796,1.635
United States.,398.431,1.201
"Beyond the company executives,",399.632,2.202
representatives from the machinists and steel,401.834,1.702
workers&amp;#39; unions were also be in attendance.,403.536,3.17
Their motorcycles have carried our American,406.706,1.568
service members in war.,408.274,1.435
They carry our police officers that,409.709,1.334
keep us safe.,411.043,1.068
They carry the Secret Service as they protect,412.111,1.702
our presidents.,413.813,1.401
And they bring joy to millions of Americans and,415.214,1.869
throughout the world -- and others throughout the,417.083,2.102
"world, rather.",419.185,0.667
The President is looking forward to hosting these,419.852,1.402
leaders from one of America&amp;#39;s truly great,421.254,2.369
entrepreneurial success stories.,423.623,1.668
"The American worker built this country, and the",425.291,1.335
President is focused on restoring a government,426.626,1.368
that puts their interests first.,427.994,1.334
A few administrative notes.,429.328,0.668
"The National Security Advisor, Mike Flynn, today",429.996,1.334

the President for,455.521,0.668
International Economic Affairs.,456.189,2.035
"Lastly, we had a great reaction to our Skype",458.224,2.202
introduction seats yesterday.,460.426,1.435
I know we&amp;#39;ve had a tremendous amount of,461.861,1.935
requests pouring in from around the country.,463.796,2.102
Please contact the press office if you know of any,465.898,2.169
that has an interest in joining us in the future.,468.067,2.636
"In terms of the schedule for tomorrow, the",470.703,2.035

Strategic and Policy Forum.,473.439,1.869
"Then, in the afternoon, the President will have",475.308,1.368
lunch with General Flynn before departing down to,476.676,3.537
Mar-a-Lago later in the day.,480.213,1.134
"With that, I&amp;#39;ll take some questions.",481.347,2.135
Katie Pavlich.,483.482,1.635
"Katie Pavlich: Hi, Sean.",485.117,0.501
Thanks for the question.,485.852,0.8
"Today, President Trump talked about Christian",487.553,1.735
"genocide at the National Prayer Breakfast, and last",489.555,2.336
year the Obama State Department officially,491.891,1.568
declared a genocide by ISIS against Christians,494.026,2.636
and other minority and religious groups in the,497.23,1.568
Middle East and North Africa.,499.198,0.668
Now that Rex Tillerson has been sworn in as the,500.933,1.936
"Secretary, what specifically is the",503.169,1.802
administration planning to do to comply with the,504.971,2.335
legal obligations of protecting these,507.306,3.504
groups under the U.N.,510.81,1.101
1948 Treaty?,511.911,2.602
Sean Spicer: T great question.,514.513,0.668
I think Secretary Tillerson is learning his,515.181,1.702
way around the building so far this morning.,517.25,2.168
He gave a great speech talking about his vision,519.418,2.536
and goal for the State Department.,522.221,1.001
I think there will be further guidance coming,523.589,1.335
"out on that, Katie.",525.258,0.967
"Right now, his job was to get in, get settled, talk",526.225,3.17
"to the employees, make sure they understood.",529.795,1.702
"But back to the issue, obviously, it&amp;#39;s",532.131,1.468
important to President.,533.866,0.834
It was during -- throughout the campaign.,534.934,1.802
"It&amp;#39;s something that he addressed this morning,",536.736,1.501
and is something that he is committed to.,538.237,2.369
He talked about it in terms of the executive,540.606,1.468
"orders, and allowing Christian minorities in",542.408,2.135
key countries seek asylum in the United States.,544.543,2.103
"He recognizes that, in so many nations, these are",547.246,2.236
the oppressed groups in,551.183,0.701
accordance with how the U.N.,551.884,1.101
defines refugees.,553.619,0.868
"So, I think you&amp;#39;ll see",555.421,0.734
further guidance with that.,556.822,0.768
Jennifer Wisson.,557.59,0.934
Jennifer Wisson: T Sean.,558.524,1.001
"I have two questions, actually.",559.992,0.834
"Today, the President renewed his promise to",563.963,0.634
"protect religious liberty,",564.597,0.801
which he says is under threat.,565.398,0.6
Some Americans see religious liberty as code,565.998,1.902
for discrimination.,567.9,1.835
Can you kind of give us a sense of how the President,569.735,1.902
views this tension?,572.038,2.435
"Sean Spicer: I interesting question,",574.473,1.635
"because I do -- you know, this is something that",576.108,1.902
comes up quite a bit.,578.01,1.735
I think there is a line.,579.745,2.269
People should -- we have freedom of religion in,582.014,2.269
"this country, and I think people should be able to",584.283,1.769
"practice their religion, express their religion,",586.519,2.335
express areas of their faith without reprisal.,588.854,3.304
And I think that pendulum sometimes swings the other,592.158,2.035
way in the name of political correctness.,594.593,3.637
And I think the President and the Vice President,598.23,1.268
both understand that one of the things that makes,600.066,2.869
our country and this democracy so great is our,602.935,2.903
"ability to express our religion, to believe in",605.838,2.903
"faith, to express it, and to live by it.",608.741,3.003
"And that&amp;#39;s where I think the important part is,",611.744,2.069
whether it&amp;#39;s a small business owner or,613.813,1.935
"employee, he wants to have some degree of expression",615.748,2.569
of faith at the company.,618.317,1.101
"And too often those voices get, you know, pushed out",619.418,3.404
in the name of political correctness.,622.822,1.535
"So, he&amp;#39;s going to continue to make sure that we not",624.357,2.135
"only speak up for it, but find ways in which we can",626.959,2.036
keep that line a little less blurred and make sure,630.129,2.903
that the pendulum doesn&amp;#39;t swing against people.,633.032,1.802
We shouldn&amp;#39;t impose a religion on anybody.,635.634,3.037
"We&amp;#39;re free to express our religion or be, you",638.671,2.803
"know, not have one.",641.474,1.935
"That&amp;#39;s obviously, under our, under, in our",643.409,1.802
"country, an equally valid way of living your life.",645.211,5.305
"But at the same time, I think people who want to",650.516,2.002
express their faith shouldn&amp;#39;t be,652.518,2.236
ostracized because they want,654.754,0.934
to live that. Major.,655.688,1.935
"Male Speaker: S could give us an example,",657.623,1.402
"if you could, of the pendulum swinging in the",659.025,2.802
direction of political correctness.,661.827,1.802
And how is that going to inform the President with,663.629,1.602
this executive order?,665.231,1.434
"And as you may know, a draft is circulating",666.665,1.502
around town and many have wondered if that is going,668.167,2.169
to be a way to either silence those on the left,670.336,5.338
or be a threat to the LGBTQ community.,675.674,2.57
Talk us through both of those.,678.244,1.034
Sean Spicer: W if you look back to the,679.845,1.368
"Little Sisters case, if you look back to other",681.213,2.102
"businesses that were, under Obamacare",683.315,2.536
-- what&amp;#39;s that?,685.851,1.302
Male Speaker: W put Hobby Lobby,687.153,0.967
in that category?,688.12,0.668
Sean Spicer: I yeah.,688.788,0.567
Absolutely. I think there&amp;#39;s several businesses and several,689.355,2.903
"institutions, Catholic institutions and others,",692.258,3.203
that have been mandated or attempted to mandate,695.461,4.938
certain things that they may or may not do or how,700.399,1.602
they have to treat their employees.,702.001,1.668
Those are instances where clearly the pendulum is,703.669,2.002
"swinging a different way, where you are not carving",705.671,2.336
out institutions or the ability for privately held,708.007,3.603
businesses to conduct themselves to live,711.61,2.303
according to their faith or their moral compass.,713.913,2.536
"And so, there&amp;#39;s clearly a lot of evidence in the",716.449,2.435
last couple years of the government coming in with,718.884,2.503
"regulations and policies that have, frankly, denied",721.387,2.836
people the ability to live according to their faith.,724.223,2.736
"Male Speaker: F President&amp;#39;s point of view,",726.959,1.735
that&amp;#39;s discriminatory in itself.,728.694,0.701
"Sean Spicer: W there&amp;#39;s, there&amp;#39;s -- like I",729.395,1.735
"said, I think it&amp;#39;s a pendulum.",731.13,0.934
"And where the President is, is that he wants to",732.064,2.469
make sure that you don&amp;#39;t penalize someone for,734.533,2.269
"wanting to express their faith, and that to the",736.802,3.404
extent that we can keep that line a little less,740.206,1.701
blurred and allow people who don&amp;#39;t believe in a,741.907,2.203
"faith or have an opposing faith, make sure that they",744.11,2.435
are equally comfortable in the workplace.,746.545,2.069
But we shouldn&amp;#39;t penalize people or mandate them to,748.614,2.703
abide by certain policies or regulations which are,751.317,3.136
in direct contradiction to their faith.,754.453,2.136
Male Speaker: A about,756.589,0.433
"the executive order, Sean?",757.022,0.935
"How does that -- Sean Spicer: There is no,",757.957,1.535
there&amp;#39;s right now no executive orders that are,759.492,2.335
official or able to read out.,761.827,1.769
We maintain that there&amp;#39;s nothing new on that front.,763.596,3.27
Male Speaker: I&amp;#39;m not -- it&amp;#39;s not a question of --,766.866,2.402
there are a lot of ideas that are being floated out,769.268,2.302
-- I mentioned this the last couple days.,771.57,2.169
"But that doesn&amp;#39;t mean -- part of it is, as the",773.739,1.802
"President does all the time, he asks for input,",775.541,2.803
"he asks for ideas, and on a variety of subjects",778.344,2.402
there are staffing procedures that go on,780.746,2.87
where people have a thought or an idea and it,783.616,2.836
goes through the process.,786.452,1.201
But until the President makes up his mind and,787.653,1.735
"gives feedback and decides that that&amp;#39;s final, there&amp;#39;s",789.388,2.536
nothing to announce.,791.924,0.834
"Male Speaker: Well Sean, thank you.",792.758,1.502
In light of the tragedy that happened in Quebec,794.26,2.235
"City last week, which Prime Minister Trudeau is",796.495,2.903
actually calling an act of terrorism --,799.398,2.703
Sean Spicer: Mm-hm.,802.101,1.368
"Male Speaker: -- what is the President doing, what",803.469,1.234
initiatives is he taking to make sure that that,804.703,2.236
"kind of homegrown, because he was a Canadian citizen,",806.939,2.669
"homegrown terrorism, homegrown violence doesn&amp;#39;t",809.608,3.504
happen within our country?,813.112,1.635
"Male Speaker: Well, there&amp;#39;s a lot of things.",814.747,1.501
"Number one, he&amp;#39;s talked cyber -- I mean, he&amp;#39;s",816.248,1.669
looking at it from every angle.,817.917,2.002
I think the first thing is to make sure that we look,819.919,1.501
at our borders.,821.42,1.034
"You&amp;#39;ve got to protect your own people first, then",822.454,2.503
you&amp;#39;ve got to look at the cyber threats.,824.957,1.501
"You&amp;#39;ve got, I mean, so there is a holistic",826.458,1.969
approach to both immigration and there&amp;#39;s a,828.427,2.236
direct nexus between immigration and national,830.663,2.035
security and personal security that he,832.698,1.702
has to look at.,834.4,1.334
But then it&amp;#39;s a multi-tiered step.,835.734,2.436
"You look at the borders, you look at who we&amp;#39;re",838.17,1.468
"letting in, and you also look at what we&amp;#39;re doing",839.638,2.169
internally with our intelligence agencies and,841.807,2.002
"the FBI that make sure that we&amp;#39;re looking at,",843.809,2.302
whether it&amp;#39;s the cyber threats that we face or,846.111,5.773
"other terrorist activities, but making",851.884,1.001
sure that we&amp;#39;re working with the NSA and the FBI,852.885,2.269
"to be ahead of the curve, if you will.",855.154,2.702
"Male Speaker: If I, if I may.",857.856,0.668
These are homegrown.,858.524,0.967
Male Speaker: Right.,859.491,0.468
Male Speaker: Okalahoma City was an American kid.,859.959,1.501
Male Speaker: Sure.,861.46,0.501
Male Speaker: Okay.,861.961,0.5
"That&amp;#39;s all, that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m asking.",862.461,0.834
Sean Spicer: That&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m saying.,863.295,1.068
"But I think that, part of it is, looking at using",864.363,1.835
"the assets that we have here, the NSA, the FBI --",866.198,3.837
looking at using the different agencies to see,870.035,2.703
if we can get ahead of the curve and see things.,872.738,1.435
"And a lot of times, that&amp;#39;s been a very big issue, is",874.173,2.702
getting ahead of the curve for when there are,876.875,1.736
"telltale signs, having the reporting systems up,",878.611,2.502
working with the various agencies.,881.113,1.602
"But it&amp;#39;s a multi-effort process, if you will. Kristen.",882.715,3.603
Male Speaker: How about --,886.318,0.534
Female Speaker: Sean --,886.852,0.401
Sean Spicer: Kristen.,887.253,0.633
Female Speaker: Sean thank you.,887.886,0.935
Why is the administration easing sanctions against,888.821,2.302
Russia at the time that --,891.123,1.535
Sean Spicer: We&amp;#39;re not easing sanctions.,892.658,0.434
"The Treasury Department -- it is, from what I",893.092,2.169
"understand, it&amp;#39;s a fairly common practice for the",895.261,2.802
"Treasury Department, after sanctions are put in",898.063,2.77
"place, to go back and to look at whether or not",900.833,3.47
"there needs to be specific carve-outs for different,",904.303,5.038
"you know, either industries or products and",909.341,2.903
services that need to be going back and forth.,912.244,2.102
But I would refer you back to the Treasury Department,914.346,1.802
on that one.,916.148,0.567
"Female Speaker: Hold on, Sean.",916.715,0.768
The language on the Treasury Department,917.483,2.736
"website suggests that you are, in fact, easing",920.219,2.469
sanctions that authorizes certain transactions with,922.688,3.337
the Federal Security Service.,926.025,2.102
Does that not suggest a shift from what was,928.127,2.235
put in place --,930.362,0.467
Sean Spicer: No it doesn&amp;#39;t.,930.829,0.434
Female Speaker: So explain --,931.263,0.434
"Sean Spicer: It is, from what I understand, a",931.697,1.468
regular course of action.,933.165,0.434
"The Treasury does, quite often, when there are",933.599,2.235
"sanction imposed, but I would refer you back to",935.834,1.936
the Treasury Department.,937.77,0.667
Female Speaker: Thank you.,938.437,0.534
Could I ask you to describe the tone of the,938.971,3.503
call on the weekend between the Australian,942.474,0.734
"Prime Minister and the President, and also",943.208,6.207
outline the President&amp;#39;s concerns about the refugee,949.415,2.068
deal in question?,951.483,2.336
"And I asked you this earlier this week, but",953.819,2.603
could you clarify whether the deal is on or not?,956.422,3.003
Because the President tweeted last night &amp;quot;I will,959.425,2.102
"study this dumb deal,&amp;quot; implying that he&amp;#39;s",961.527,3.203
still considering it.,964.73,1.034
Sean Spicer: Right.,965.764,1.035
The President had a very cordial conversation with,966.799,1.434
"Prime Minister Turnbull, where they went through an",968.233,3.604
extensive discussion of this deal.,971.837,4.705
The President is unbelievably disappointed,976.542,2.269
in the previous administration&amp;#39;s deal that,978.811,6.339
"was made and how poorly it was crafted, and the",985.15,3.137
threat to national security it put the,988.287,1.802
United States on.,990.089,0.834
He has tremendous respect for the Prime Minister and,990.923,2.536
"for the Australian people, and has agreed to continue",993.459,1.968
to review that deal and to ensure that as part of,995.427,3.837
"the deal, which was always part of it, that we would",999.264,2.103
"go through a very, very extreme vetting process to",1001.367,4.471
ensure that every single person that is being,1005.838,2.202
offered up is coming here with peaceful intentions,1008.04,3.303
and poses no threat to the United States.,1011.343,1.335
"So, he has ensured that while he has respect for",1012.678,3.77
the Australian people and respect for Prime Minister,1016.448,3.404
"Turnbull, that we do not pose a threat to the",1019.852,3.169
"United States of America, that the deal that was cut",1023.021,3.938
by the last administration is something that he is,1026.959,1.635
"extremely, extremely upset with.",1028.594,2.969
"He does not like it, but out of respect for him,",1031.563,3.07
he&amp;#39;s going to allow that process -- continue to,1034.633,2.402
study it and allow it to move forward under the,1037.035,1.936
conditions that have been set -- that there will be,1038.971,3.87
extreme vetting on every single one of,1042.841,1.669
those individuals.,1044.51,1.101
"Female Speaker: Okay, but just, just for clarity.",1045.611,1.902
Sean Spicer: Yeah.,1047.513,0.634
"Female Speaker: The deal itself, is still under",1048.147,1.868
review so it&amp;#39;s not certain to proceed or it will,1050.015,2.603
proceed and those people will be let in?,1052.618,1.601
"Sean Spicer: Yeah, part of the, part of the deal was",1054.219,2.336
that -- the deal allows for the United States to,1056.555,1.168
vet the individuals that are being offered up,1057.723,2.636
to be processed.,1060.359,1.468
The President&amp;#39;s goal is to make sure that every,1061.827,2.202
"single one of those people, in accordance with",1064.029,2.536
the deal and as discussed in the telephone,1066.565,2.002
"conversation with the Prime Minister, is subject",1068.567,2.169
to extreme vetting to ensure that,1070.736,2.436
no one puts it.,1073.172,0.867
But I cannot underscore how disappointed he was in,1074.039,3.804
the deal that was made and how he thought it was just,1077.843,2.302
a horrible deal that was offered up by the United,1080.145,2.77
States by the previous administration. Sarah.,1082.915,1.801
Female Speaker: The President and his National,1084.716,2.57
Security Advisor have been clear that the,1087.286,1.635
administration wants to put Iran on notice --,1088.921,1.801
Male Speaker: Okay.,1090.722,1.068
Female Speaker: -- but they haven&amp;#39;t specified,1091.79,0.734
what that is.,1092.524,0.701
What options are on the table and are there any,1093.225,3.403
options like military action that might be off,1096.628,1.435
the table at this point?,1098.063,1.335
"Male Speaker: So, I think General Flynn was really",1099.398,1.535
clear yesterday that Iran has violated the Joint,1100.933,5.338
"Resolution, that Iran&amp;#39;s additional hostile actions",1106.271,3.27
that it took against our Navy vessel are ones that,1109.541,2.269
we are very clear are not going to sit by and take.,1111.81,1.669
I think that we will have further updates for you on,1113.479,3.97
"those additional actions, but clearly, we wanted to",1117.449,2.536
make sure that Iran understood that they are,1119.985,1.401
"on notice, this is not",1121.386,1.435
going un-responded to. John.,1122.821,2.269
Male Speaker: Thank you very much.,1125.09,1.001
Male Speaker: It was a Saudi Vessel.,1126.091,4.438
Sean Spicer: Thank you. Yes.,1130.529,1.301
"Male Speaker: They thought it was American, but it&amp;#39;s",1131.83,0.734
a Saudi Vessel.,1132.564,0.567
"Sean Spicer: Right, that&amp;#39;s right. John.",1133.131,0.534
"Male Speaker: Thank you, Sean.",1133.665,1.001
"On January 27th, at the Republican retreat in",1134.666,4.538
"Philadelphia, Vice President Pence had a",1139.204,1.835
closed-door meeting with House Republicans where,1141.039,2.736
several of them brought up the case of IRS,1143.775,4.605
Commissioner John Koskinen.,1148.38,2.136
"There was an attempt to impeach him last year,",1150.516,2.369
which some of the leadership in the House,1152.885,1.901
"felt was unfair to the commissioner, and they",1154.786,3.137
urged him to tell the President that given his,1157.923,2.869
"entire record, he should fire him or ask for his",1160.792,4.138
resignation soon.,1164.93,1.868

nothing to update you on. Hallie?,1175.774,1.935
"Female Speaker: Sean, on Yemen, it was initially",1177.709,0.768
"described, the raid over the weekend, as a",1178.477,2.402
successful raid by the administration.,1180.879,2.469
There are now some questions that CENTCOM has,1183.348,1.502
raised about the possibility of additional,1184.85,1.568
civilian casualties.,1186.418,1.001
"So, I&amp;#39;ve got a couple of questions for",1187.419,0.901
you on this one.,1188.32,1.034
Would you still stand by your characterization of,1189.354,2.603
the raid as successful?,1191.957,0.901
Was the President given multiple options about,1192.858,2.569
"this raid, or just one?",1195.427,1.335
And were there consultations with the,1196.762,1.368
prior administration&amp;#39;s national security,1198.13,2.469
"officials, military officials about the",1200.599,1.435

"Actually, I&amp;#39;d like to just walk through that.",1203.936,1.701
I appreciate you bringing this up.,1205.637,1.201
There is -- let&amp;#39;s go through the tick-tock on,1206.838,2.737
that raid.,1209.575,1.101
"On November 7th, CENTCOM submitted the plan to DOD.",1210.676,3.136
"Clearly, that was under the last administration.",1213.812,2.936
Legal teams were involved immediately when it was,1216.748,3.003
submitted to DOD.,1219.751,1.235
"On December 19th, the plan was approved by the",1220.986,1.935
Department of Defense and recommended that it be,1222.921,1.935
moved ahead.,1224.856,1.135
It was sent then to the National Security Council,1225.991,2.769
staff here in the White House.,1228.76,1.168
"Again, it all, this all happened under the",1229.928,3.037
previous administration.,1232.965,1.134
"On January 6th, there was an interagency",1234.099,2.202
deputies meeting.,1236.301,1.368
The deputies recommended at that time that,1237.669,1.602
they go ahead.,1239.271,1.268
It was so easily approved it was sent straight up.,1240.539,2.836
"The conclusion to hold was, at that time, to hold",1243.375,2.069
"for what they called a &amp;quot;moonless night,&amp;quot; which,",1245.444,2.836
"by calendar, wouldn&amp;#39;t occur until",1248.28,1.802

"recommendation and the status of the operation,",1269.067,2.77
or potential operation.,1271.837,1.368

Friday the 26th.,1303.268,1.335
"In the morning, the",1304.603,0.7
deputies committee met again.,1305.303,1.068
It was not a necessary step because they had,1306.371,1.702
previously recommended and also reaffirmed their,1308.073,2.269
support for that.,1310.342,1.335
"On January 26th, the President signed the memo",1311.677,3.436
authorizing the action.,1315.113,1.068

Female Speaker: Where was the President the,1334.499,0.634
night of the raid?,1335.133,0.801
How did he learn about Chief Owen&amp;#39;s death and do,1335.934,1.702
you still by your characterization that,1337.636,1.635
it was successful?,1339.271,1.334
Sean Spicer: Th President was here,1340.605,0.935
in the residence.,1341.54,0.734
He was kept in touch with,1342.274,1.101
his national security staff.,1343.375,1.968

"And again, I think -- I would go back to what I",1358.824,2.602
said yesterday.,1361.426,1.368
It&amp;#39;s hard to ever call something a complete,1362.794,2.937
"success when you have the loss of life,",1365.731,1.568
or people injured.,1367.299,1.435
But I think when you look at the totality of what,1368.734,2.769
was gained to prevent the future loss of life here,1371.503,3.637
in America and against our people and our,1375.14,2.469
"institutions, and probably throughout the world in",1377.609,2.002
terms of what some of these individuals could,1379.611,1.502
"have done, I think it is a successful operation",1381.113,4.471
by all standards.,1385.584,1.868
"And again, I want to reiterate, it is tough to",1387.452,2.836
ever use the word &amp;quot;success&amp;quot; when you know,1390.288,2.403
that somebody has lost their life.,1392.691,1.768
But when you go back and look at an individual that,1394.459,6.774
"dedicated their life to serving this country, and",1401.233,3.169
went over and over and over again knowing that,1404.402,2.603
this not only the risk that he took but wanted to,1407.005,4.071
do it because he knew the threat that these kind of,1411.076,2.969
"individuals pose to our country and to our people,",1414.045,2.636
"you know, that, that&amp;#39;s -- while not a success that",1416.681,2.703

Hunter Walker.,1424.256,0.734
"Hunter Walker: Thank you, Sean.",1424.99,0.867
I&amp;#39;ve seen some criticism of the President&amp;#39;s remarks,1425.857,3.137
at the prayer breakfast this morning.,1428.994,2.335
Can you shed any light on why he thought that was a,1431.329,1.936
good venue to mock &amp;quot;The Apprentice&amp;quot; for,1433.265,1.868
its ratings?,1435.133,1.468
"Male Speaker: Look, Mark Burnett, the creator of",1436.601,1.368

"relationship, was there.",1442.808,1.634
He meant it as a light-hearted moment.,1444.442,1.702
And I think if you look at the totality of his,1446.144,1.435
remarks and they were absolutely beautiful.,1447.579,3.604
"And I think to hone in on that, it was a",1451.183,3.77
light-hearted moment he was trying to have with a,1454.953,2.169
big supporter of the National Prayer Breakfast,1457.122,2.436
and a personal friend.,1459.558,0.934
