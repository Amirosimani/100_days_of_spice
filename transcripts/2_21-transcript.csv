executive orders that are designed to,85.452,1.935
protect the homeland.,87.387,1.501
These two memos provide explicit guidance to DHS,88.888,3.137
staff on how to carry out two executive orders,92.025,2.736
signed by the President on January 25th -- one,94.761,3.103
dealing with interior enforcement and one,97.864,2.569
dealing with border security.,100.433,1.969
"Perhaps most critically, the President is",102.402,2.202
empowering DHS to carry out the immigration laws,104.604,2.636
currently on the books.,107.24,1.001
"Of course, DHS gave a full briefing on these memos",108.241,3.27
"this morning, but just to briefly summarize a few of",111.511,3.537
the facts: The memo regarding the executive,115.048,2.769

"within ICE, fulfilling another major campaign",142.475,3.237
promise of the President.,145.712,1.568
This office will facilitate the engagement,147.28,2.703

Trinidad and Tobago.,208.841,1.502
Readouts of those calls have both been provided.,210.343,2.769
The President&amp;#39;s team this weekend also had a very,213.112,2.203
productive meeting on the President&amp;#39;s plan to repeal,215.315,1.968
"and replace Obamacare, and ensure that it is replaced",217.283,3.137
with a system that works for all Americans.,220.42,2.335
"Back to the President&amp;#39;s schedule today, in honor",222.755,1.869

day by visiting the National Museum of African,226.392,2.937
American History and Culture.,229.329,1.868
The museum opened last September and has quickly,231.197,2.403
become one of Washington&amp;#39;s most-visited attractions.,233.6,2.869
The President was joined by a group of individuals,236.469,2.102

The President commented several times during his,255.922,1.735

Some of the exhibits that he was particularly drawn,261.394,1.768
"to included the section on Harriet Tubman, which",263.162,2.436
featured a shawl that was given to her by Queen,265.598,1.835
Victoria in the late 1800s; the section of the,267.433,3.003
museum that featured the courageous contribution of,270.436,2.77
African Americans that have made to the United,273.206,2.269
States military.,275.475,0.767
And the President was particularly pleased by,276.242,2.302
"the Muhammad Ali exhibit with the quote, &amp;quot;I shook",278.544,2.77
up the world&amp;quot; prominently displayed.,281.314,2.202
The President also enjoyed viewing for the first time,283.516,2.569

his extraordinary life.,290.156,2.202

"country, dedicated to liberty and justice.",311.377,3.27
"This afternoon, the President will have a",314.647,1.602

"Presidential Daily Briefing, which he",320.453,1.335
received earlier this morning.,321.788,1.935
"Then, this evening the President will have dinner",323.723,1.601
with Vice President Pence.,325.324,1.335
I&amp;#39;m sure that they will discuss the Vice,326.659,1.735
President&amp;#39;s recent trip to Europe.,328.394,2.636
The Vice President was an incredible representative,331.03,2.202
"for our nation and the President during his time,",333.232,2.77
where he reiterated our support for our European,336.002,2.269
allies in unified pursuit of the noble ideals of,338.271,3.303

During his speech before the Munich Security,350.75,2.202

unwavering commitment to Europe&amp;#39;s peace and,356.389,2.669
"prosperity, especially remembering the tens of",359.058,2.336
thousands of Americans who gave their lives to defend,361.394,2.469
those ideals during both World War I and II.,363.863,2.97
These shared sacrifices are the backbone of our,366.833,2.002
alliance and our mission of security through strength.,368.835,3.737
"During his time in Munich, the Vice President also",372.572,1.735
met with nine world leaders.,374.307,1.935
The Vice President and these leaders discussed,376.242,1.835
"the issues most pressing to them, including the",378.077,2.136
escalating violence in eastern Ukraine and the,380.213,3.036

Council of the European Union and NATO Secretary,391.491,2.602
-- the NATO Secretary General.,394.093,2.036
"As a candidate for office, President Trump actually",396.129,2.035
called attention repeatedly to the fact,398.164,2.202
"that for too long, many of our NATO allies have not",400.366,4.471
been sharing the financial burden.,404.837,2.603
The President looks forward to working closely,407.44,1.535
with NATO to advance our shared objectives.,408.975,2.169
A strong NATO means a safer world.,411.144,2.802
And the United States looks forward to working,413.946,1.802
with our partners in NATO to achieve just that.,415.748,3.17
Looking ahead to the President&amp;#39;s upcoming,418.918,1.635

"of State Tillerson, fresh off his trip to Germany",422.622,3.236
for the G20 Foreign Ministers Summit.,425.858,2.736
They&amp;#39;ll discuss the President&amp;#39;s foreign policy,428.594,1.769
agenda and the Secretary&amp;#39;s upcoming trip to Mexico.,430.363,3.77
"Thursday morning, he&amp;#39;ll have a listening session",434.133,1.769
regarding job creation in the manufacturing sector,435.902,2.836
with CEOs and business leaders from,438.738,2.369
different industries.,441.107,1.301
"On Friday, he&amp;#39;ll deliver remarks to the",442.408,1.635
Conservative Political Action Conference.,444.043,2.035
And we are just one week out today from the,446.078,1.902
President&amp;#39;s Joint Address to Congress.,447.98,2.469
The President will continue to work closely,450.449,1.502
with his team to craft a speech that lays out his,451.951,2.636
ambitious policy agenda that will benefit,454.587,2.102
all Americans.,456.689,1.268
Plans are currently in the works for pre- and,457.957,1.835
post-address activities for the President,459.792,2.269
and his staff.,462.061,0.667
And we&amp;#39;ll have more updates as the week goes on.,462.728,2.903
"Before I take your questions, I want to",465.631,1.335
address the recent threats and acts of vandalism on,466.966,2.97
Jewish community centers throughout the country.,469.936,2.736
The President said this morning -- I just want to,472.672,1.501
reiterate -- &amp;quot;The anti-Semitic threats,474.173,2.436
targeting our Jewish community centers are,476.609,2.236
"horrible and painful, and a very sad reminder of the",478.845,3.003
work that we must do&amp;quot; -- excuse me -- &amp;quot;the work,481.848,2.102
that must be done to root our hate and,483.95,3.203
prejudice and evil.&amp;quot;,487.153,1.101
"With that, I&amp;#39;ll take some of your questions.",488.254,1.768
Jim Stinson.,490.022,0.568
"The Press: Sean, thank you.",490.59,3.003
I was curious if the President regrets or wants,493.593,3.47
to clarify his characterization -- by the,497.063,2.035
"way, I have two questions -- of the media as an",499.098,2.669
&amp;quot;enemy of the American people.&amp;quot;,501.767,0.801
Mr. Spicer: I think the President has been very,502.568,2.036
clear that certain outlets have gone out of their way,504.604,3.236
"to not represent his record accurately, and it",507.84,4.004
is a concern to him.,511.844,2.269
And I think some reporters -- he has deep respect for,514.113,3.237
"the First Amendment, for the role of the press --",517.35,2.102
I&amp;#39;ve addressed this multiple times in the past.,519.452,2.702
He has a healthy respect for the press.,522.154,1.502
"But I think that it&amp;#39;s a two-way street, as I&amp;#39;ve",523.656,2.469
"also said before, and I think that the President",526.125,1.835
understands that certain outlets have gone out of,527.96,2.703
their way to not be completely accurate and,530.663,2.402
fair in their coverage of what&amp;#39;s going on.,533.065,2.002
"The Press: Speaking of the media, I&amp;#39;ve noticed two",535.067,4.471
times in the last week that you&amp;#39;ve been directly,539.538,2.436
"contradicted by two members of the media, one",541.974,2.236
"of them Bill Maher of HBO, who said that in front of",544.21,3.804
"guests at Mar-a-Lago, the President was briefed on",548.014,2.168
the classified North Korean situation.,550.182,3.904
"Mr. Spicer: Say that again, I&amp;#39;m sorry.",554.086,1.802
The Press: The President and the Prime Minister of,555.888,2.336
Japan were briefed in front of guests --,558.224,1.935
"Mr. Spicer: No, I didn&amp;#39;t say that.",560.159,1.001
"The Press: No, no, no, this is what was being",561.16,2.703
"said on HBO, that the President and the Prime",563.863,5.272
Minister were briefed on classified information in,569.135,2.302
front of guests at Mar-a-Lago.,571.437,1.068
"I just want to clarify, did that happen?",572.505,1.935
Did they --,574.44,0.801
Mr. Spicer: No.,575.241,0.4
No.,575.641,0.467
"I think I walked through this timeline before, Jim.",576.108,4.305
"And it&amp;#39;s amazing -- a photo gets put out, the",580.413,2.702
"President has got a piece of paper, and the",583.115,1.735
immediate conclusion is he&amp;#39;s got to be talking,584.85,2.036
about classified information.,586.886,2.569
The President was briefed on the situation in North,589.455,3.77
"Korea prior to the dinner, in a SCIF, that&amp;#39;s at",593.225,3.204
Mar-a-Lago.,596.429,1.001
He went and had dinner.,597.43,0.901
"He discussed the logistics of the press conference,",598.331,2.502
which I&amp;#39;ve talked to you all before -- there was a,600.833,1.735
question as to where to hold the press conference.,602.568,2.369
They had a discussion about the logistics of it.,604.937,2.169
"And subsequent to that dinner, he was briefed",607.106,1.602
again in a SCIF with updates on the situation,608.708,2.535
in North Korea.,611.243,0.868
"That&amp;#39;s it, plain and simple.",612.111,1.468
"But to your first question, I think that",613.579,2.436
it&amp;#39;s amazing that the immediate jump of,616.015,4.271
"conclusion to several outlets was, well, there&amp;#39;s",620.286,2.235
"a piece of paper, it must be classified.",622.521,2.636
I don&amp;#39;t -- it&amp;#39;s amazing to see that and to see people,625.157,4.271
jump to that conclusion that he&amp;#39;s surrounded by,629.428,2.57
"his staff and members of the Japanese delegation,",631.998,3.003
the conclusion is they must be doing something,635.001,1.634
nefarious or wrong.,636.635,1.535
"In fact, he followed every procedure that&amp;#39;s laid out.",638.17,4.104
"And I think in some cases, it&amp;#39;s disheartening to",642.274,2.87
realize that those are the kind of immediate,645.144,2.069
conclusions that somebody jumps to.,647.213,2.102
"So when you talk about coverage, we have",649.315,4.037
a free press.,653.352,0.668
We have the right for people to say and do,654.02,2.235
what they believe.,656.255,1.101
"But at some point, it is incumbent upon people to",657.356,2.903
try to get it right.,660.259,0.701
"And in that case, it wasn&amp;#39;t even attempted.",660.96,2.302
It was a jump to conclusion by many to say,663.262,2.703
that there must be something else going on,665.965,1.902
"when, in fact, we were able to provide a very,",667.867,1.601
very clear tick-tock as to what had happened in that.,669.468,3.137
Jessica.,672.605,1.067
"The Press: Sean, a question about the",673.672,1.602
resignation of 10 people on the Asian American Council.,675.274,2.736
That happened last week.,678.01,2.503
"And in the letter, they said in part, &amp;quot;We can no",680.513,1.968
longer serve a President whose policies aim to,682.481,2.136
create outcomes that are diametrically opposite to,684.617,2.202
"our principles, goals and charge.&amp;quot;",686.819,2.202
"First of all, what&amp;#39;s the White House&amp;#39;s reaction?",689.021,2.302
And do you plan to appoint your own members,691.323,3.337
to this council?,694.66,1.235
Mr. Spicer: Those members of that council were,695.895,1.968
political appointees of the Obama administration.,697.863,1.936
Their terms were set to expire this year.,699.799,1.434
So it&amp;#39;s not surprising in the sense that they were,701.233,4.038
appointees of Barack Obama.,705.271,1.968
They were going to have their terms expire.,707.239,1.569
The Press: But in terms of --,708.808,1.501
"But again, but -- I get it, but most political",710.309,1.902
appointees from other agencies or whatever would,712.211,2.502
automatically resign because of the term of,714.713,2.536
"these individuals, they would carry through until",717.249,1.702
later in the year.,718.951,1.068
But I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s surprising that people who,720.019,1.468
were appointed by Barack Obama to fulfill his,721.487,2.536
agenda suddenly understand that there is a new,724.023,3.136
administration in town and didn&amp;#39;t want to stay on board.,727.159,3.771
But we will make sure that we appoint people to,730.93,2.335
this task force.,733.265,0.701
It&amp;#39;s important.,733.966,1.034
It&amp;#39;s something that&amp;#39;s provided guidance to,735,1.769
"multiple presidents in the past, and we will",736.769,1.902
continue to do that.,738.671,1.001
Shannon.,739.672,0.634
The Press: On the statement today about the,740.306,4.304
"anti-Semitic acts, what specifically is the",744.61,2.836
President going to do to address that issue?,747.446,2.736
"And, along those lines, there were reports earlier",750.182,3.203
on that he was considering changing the mandate of,753.385,3.003
this countering violent extremism program to focus,756.388,4.105
just on Islamic extremist groups.,760.493,2.802
"Is he still considering that, or would he also",763.295,3.771
leave the scope of the program to also consider --,767.066,2.469
Mr. Spicer: Are you talking about the travel,769.535,1.802
executive order?,771.337,0.667
"The Press: No, no, no, this is the countering",772.004,1.869
violent extremism program that --,773.873,2.235
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, I think we&amp;#39;re getting ahead of",776.108,1.935
ourselves there.,778.043,0.668
There&amp;#39;s nothing to announce on that front.,778.711,1.735
"And secondly, to the first part of your question, I",780.446,1.768
think the President is going to do what he&amp;#39;s,782.214,1.902
talked about since election night.,784.116,2.836
"It&amp;#39;s through deed and action, talk about how we",786.952,3.437
"can unify this country and speak out against hate,",790.389,3.237
"anti-Semitism, racism.",793.626,2.035
And he&amp;#39;s going to continue to do that.,795.661,1.802
And I think that he will show you over the course,797.463,2.836
"of months and years, through what he does in",800.299,2.636
"terms of his policies and his speech, that he is",802.935,4.404
going to be a President that brings people,807.339,2.603
"together, that unites them, and that speaks",809.942,2.135
"very, very forcefully against those who are",812.077,2.87
seeking to do hate or to tear people down because,814.947,2.636
of their religion or their gender or the color,817.583,3.236
of their skin.,820.819,0.668
"I mean, those are all things that I think the",821.487,1.334
President was clear on.,822.821,0.735
John.,823.556,0.467
"The Press: Two questions unrelated, if I could.",824.023,2.068
The next big piece in the immigration profile here,826.091,5.94
at the White House is going to be the new,832.031,1.334
executive order.,833.365,0.835
Is the President confident that this one will pass,834.2,3.003
legal muster?,837.203,0.867
"And if he is, what gives him that confidence?",838.07,2.736
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think -- first, I want to be",840.806,2.636
clear that we feel confident that we&amp;#39;re still,843.442,2.035
going to prevail on the case -- the merits,845.477,1.836
of the case.,847.313,1.601
I think that as was seen in the case of,848.914,1.335
"Massachusetts, once it is fully adjudicated, we will",850.249,3.37
prevail because the authority is granted to,853.619,2.469
"the President to do what he has to, to protect",856.088,2.236
the country.,858.324,0.667
"So I feel very, very confident about where",858.991,2.102
we&amp;#39;re going to go.,861.093,0.667
The second track that he&amp;#39;s made very clear as well is,861.76,2.136
"that until that occurs, we&amp;#39;re going to have a",863.896,1.968
dual-track system.,865.864,1.168
And then we&amp;#39;re going to make sure that we,867.032,1.335
implement a second executive order that is,868.367,1.902
tailored to achieve the same goals but in,870.269,2.302
accordance with what the court said.,872.571,1.935
So we&amp;#39;ve been working very closely with the,874.506,1.902
"Department of State, Department of Homeland",876.408,1.435
"Security, Department of Justice and the team here",877.843,2.236
at the White House to make sure that the next step,880.079,4.037
achieves the President&amp;#39;s goal of protecting the,884.116,1.668
country and does so in a way that recognizes the,885.784,2.736
concerns that the court had until we prevail at a,888.52,3.804
later time.,892.324,0.668
So it&amp;#39;s a dual-track thing.,892.992,2.102
The Press: Will this administration send,895.094,3.67
American terror suspects picked up overseas to,898.764,2.97
Guantanamo Bay for interrogation,901.734,2.269
or prosecution?,904.003,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I am not going to discuss that right now.,904.67,2.336
"As the President has said very clearly before, we",907.006,2.335
don&amp;#39;t telegraph what we&amp;#39;re going to do.,909.341,1.969
"I think he has made very clear, though, that he",911.31,2.436
"believes that Guantanamo Bay does serve a very,",913.746,3.403
very healthy purpose in our national security in,917.149,1.835
making sure that we don&amp;#39;t bring terrorists to our seas.,918.984,2.403
But I&amp;#39;m not going to get into what we may or may,921.387,2.068
not do in the future.,923.455,0.734
The Press: Including American citizens?,924.189,0.935
"Mr. Spicer: Again, I&amp;#39;m just not going to --",925.124,0.8
"The Press: Sean, I want to give you a chance to",925.924,2.036
respond to something because I think the,927.96,1.368
President&amp;#39;s remarks and your clarification about,929.328,2.302
where he stands on anti-Semitism is clear.,931.63,2.836
"But after that statement was made by the President,",934.466,3.003
The Anne Frank Center released a pretty strongly,937.469,2.503
"worded one, saying that these remarks, while",939.972,2.803
"well-received, are a Band-Aid on the cancer",942.775,2.802
"within the Trump administration, saying",945.577,3.337
"that there is, whether blessed or otherwise, a",948.914,3.504
sense of xenophobia within this administration.,952.418,3.336
What do you think about that?,955.754,1.101
"Mr. Spicer: Look, the President has made",956.855,2.336
"clear since the day he was elected and, frankly,",959.191,2.87
"going back through the campaign, that he is",962.061,2.135
someone who seeks to unite this country.,964.196,1.301
He has brought a diverse group of folks into his,965.497,4.271
"administration, both in terms of actual positions",969.768,2.803
and people that he has sought the advice of.,972.571,2.803
And I think he has been very forceful with his,975.374,5.272
denunciation of people who seek to attack people,980.646,4.571
"because of their hate -- excuse me, because of",985.217,2.069
"their religion, because of their gender, because of",987.286,2.369
the color of their skin.,989.655,0.867
And it is something that he is going to continue to,990.522,1.735
"fight and make very, very clear that he has no place",992.257,2.87
in this administration.,995.127,1.802
But I think that it&amp;#39;s ironic that no matter how,996.929,3.403
"many times he talks about this, that it&amp;#39;s",1000.332,3.604
never good enough.,1003.936,2.402
Today I think was an unbelievably forceful,1006.338,2.536
comment by the President as far as his denunciation,1008.874,3.27
of the actions that are currently targeted towards,1012.144,2.035
"Jewish community centers, but I think that he&amp;#39;s been",1014.179,2.503
very clear previous to this that he wants to be,1016.682,5.105
someone that brings this country together and not,1021.787,1.768
"divide people, especially in those areas.",1023.555,2.002
So I saw that statement.,1025.557,1.702
I wish that they had praised the President,1027.259,4.204
for his leadership in this area.,1031.463,1.335
"And I think that hopefully, as time",1032.798,1.802
"continues to go by, they recognize his commitment",1034.6,2.469
"to civil rights, to voting rights, to equality",1037.069,4.204
for all Americans.,1041.273,0.901
"The Press: Sean, on that, the southern part of --",1042.174,3.203
Mr. Spicer: We started early with the two questions.,1045.377,1.068
The Press: Sorry.,1046.445,0.4
"Sean, Southern Poverty -- I think you&amp;#39;ll want to",1046.845,1.802
respond to this.,1048.647,1.201
Mr. Spicer: Okay.,1049.848,0.534
The Press: Southern Poverty Law Center said,1050.382,0.834
that the number of anti-Muslim groups in the U.S.,1051.216,2.303
"has tripled between 2015 and 2016, during the time",1053.519,3.503
of the campaign.,1057.022,0.901
Is this message within the administration --,1057.923,2.102
"anti-Semitism is not allowed, xenophobia is not",1060.025,3.07
allowed -- anti-Muslim sentiment within the,1063.095,2.369
"administration, has the President been forceful",1065.464,1.835
about that particular issue?,1067.299,1.568
"Mr. Spicer: I think that the President, in terms of",1068.867,3.337
"his desire to combat radical Islamic terrorism,",1072.204,3.303
he understands that people who want to express a,1075.507,3.137
peaceful position have every right in,1078.644,2.102
our Constitution.,1080.746,0.667
But if you come here or want to express views that,1081.413,3.037
"seek to do our country or our people harm, he is",1084.45,2.802
"going to fight it aggressively, whether it&amp;#39;s",1087.252,1.468
domestic acts that are going on here or attempts,1088.72,3.771
through people abroad to come into this country.,1092.491,2.035
So there&amp;#39;s a big difference between,1094.526,1.335
preventing attacks and making sure that we keep,1095.861,2.436
this country safe so that there is no loss of life,1098.297,4.938
in allowing people to express themselves in,1103.235,1.668
accordance with our First Amendment.,1104.903,1.335
"Those are two very, very different, different,",1106.238,2.269
different things.,1108.507,0.767
"The Press: Sean, you talked about how the",1109.274,4.271
manufacturing -- I didn&amp;#39;t know where you were going.,1113.545,2.67
Mr. Spicer: I was (inaudible),1116.215,0.8
in the back.,1117.015,1.135
(laughter),1118.15,2.903
The Press: I saw the manufacturing CEOs are,1121.053,1.568
"coming on Thursday, so let me ask you something",1122.621,1.869
"that&amp;#39;s important to them, which is the border",1124.49,2.369
adjustment tax.,1126.859,0.767
The President earlier this year called it &amp;quot;too,1127.626,2.769
complicated.&amp;quot; Does he still feel that way?,1130.395,3.037
"And whether he feels this is complicated or not, is",1133.432,3.303
there something within the administration one way or,1136.735,3.203
"another about whether the President, the",1139.938,2.202
administration wants to see this in or out,1142.14,1.936
of the tax package?,1144.076,0.767
Mr. Spicer: So there&amp;#39;s several pieces to that,1144.843,3.337
that I&amp;#39;ll try to unpack.,1148.18,1.168
"That counts as, like, eight questions.",1149.348,2.502
"The Press: Does he feel it&amp;#39;s complicated, and",1151.85,0.834
what&amp;#39;s your preference?,1152.684,0.734
"Mr. Spicer: So, first of all, on the meeting on",1153.418,1.268
"Thursday, this is going to be a really historic",1154.686,3.671
opportunity for CEOs to come in and talk to,1158.357,3.47
members of the White House staff and others through,1161.827,2.736
"various agencies about how we can create jobs, how",1164.563,2.769
regulations are stifling economic growth.,1167.332,2.87
"And I think we&amp;#39;ll have further details on that,",1170.202,2.102
but this is going to be a real interesting,1172.304,1.902
opportunity to really create a dialogue I think,1174.206,4.471
in a manner that hasn&amp;#39;t been done before -- but,1178.677,2.002
I&amp;#39;m not going to get ahead of myself on this -- where,1180.679,2.236
we can really discuss some of the inhibitors to job,1182.915,4.104
"creation, job retraining, what do we need for",1187.019,3.436
American workers to get them ahead of the curve.,1190.455,2.403
"With respect to specific policy positions, I think",1192.858,2.436
the President has been very clear that in the,1195.294,2.302
next couple weeks we expect to have a tax plan,1197.596,1.702
that gets out there.,1199.298,1.167
That is being worked on continuously.,1200.465,2.203
And so I&amp;#39;m not going to get in front of that.,1202.668,2.469
"While the CEOs are here, I&amp;#39;m sure beyond some of",1205.137,2.135
"these things, that&amp;#39;s an opportunity for them to",1207.272,1.535
express what some of those policies are that are both,1208.807,2.836
"helping them create jobs and grow the economy, and",1211.643,2.436
also inhibiting them.,1214.079,0.801
So let&amp;#39;s let that conversation play out.,1214.88,2.703
Yes.,1217.583,0.433
"The Press: Okay, thank you, Sean.",1218.016,1.569
My name is Raquel,1219.585,1.301
from TV Global News Brazil.,1220.886,1.201
And I have a question.,1222.087,1.268
There are doubts in Brazil right now about what&amp;#39;s,1223.355,3.003
going to happen to the relationship between the,1226.358,2.502
"two countries with the new administration, especially",1228.86,2.403
related to immigration and also to trade deals.,1231.263,4.571
Does President Trump also plan to review policies --,1235.834,4.705
bilateral policies with Brazil in trade deals?,1240.539,4.004
"And also, my second question, how does the",1244.543,2.102
administration see the current turmoil --,1246.645,2.836
economical and political turmoil in Brazil?,1249.481,2.402
"And one more question, if I might.",1251.883,1.602
(laughter),1253.485,1.235
President Trump spoke with some foreign leaders from,1254.72,3.336
"South America, like Argentina, Colombia and",1258.056,2.536
"Peru, but not -- it was the Vice President that",1260.592,2.369
spoke with President Temer from Brazil.,1262.961,2.336
Why is that?,1265.297,1.001
"Mr. Spicer: Well, obviously, we cherish our",1266.298,2.536
relationship with Brazil.,1268.834,1.001
I think there&amp;#39;s a timing factor here and I think,1269.835,2.269
we&amp;#39;ll look forward to speaking with the,1272.104,1.368
President soon.,1273.472,1.067
So I wouldn&amp;#39;t read too much into that right now.,1274.539,1.702
It&amp;#39;s just a matter of getting things,1276.241,1.335
on the schedule.,1277.576,1.668
We&amp;#39;re going to review all the trade deals,1279.244,1.668
that are out there.,1280.912,0.668
The President has made very clear some of them,1281.58,1.935
"have occurred well into a decade, two decades ago.",1283.515,3.57
I think the idea is to make sure that we are,1287.085,1.702
looking at all of the trade deals we have,1288.787,2.302
throughout the globe to make sure that they,1291.089,2.036
continue to benefit America and American workers.,1293.125,2.569
"And in many cases, we can update these deals.",1295.694,2.502
So it&amp;#39;s not any one particular country.,1298.196,3.204
I think that we&amp;#39;re going to look throughout the,1301.4,1.835
"whole host of trade agreements, and then other",1303.235,3.069
trade-related agreements that we have with,1306.304,4.004
countries to make sure that they are the most,1310.308,2.069
up-to-date and they address the technological,1312.377,2.77
"advances that have occurred, and look at the",1315.147,3.136
various services -- whether it&amp;#39;s financial,1318.283,2.436
services or manufacturing -- and that they reflect,1320.719,3.337
the current state of play.,1324.056,0.967
So this isn&amp;#39;t any one country.,1325.023,2.136
I think the President made clear throughout the,1327.159,1.334
campaign and subsequent that he wants to review,1328.493,2.503
every trade deal to make sure that America and,1330.996,2.002
American workers are maintaining the,1332.998,1.568
best deal possible.,1334.566,0.767
Corbett .,1335.333,0.768
"Oh, I&amp;#39;m sorry.",1336.101,0.767
"The Press: And on the turmoil, how does the",1336.868,1.635
administration see the turmoil in Brazil now?,1338.503,2.67
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m going to -- I think that&amp;#39;s a,1341.173,0.834
question for the Department of,1342.007,0.801
State right now.,1342.808,0.667
"Corbett, yeah.",1343.475,3.837
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1347.312,0.534
Two questions for you.,1347.846,0.667
One on the NSC meeting later this afternoon.,1348.513,1.802
Is that the first meeting of the National Security,1350.315,2.469
Council of the President with all the principals there?,1352.784,1.936
"Mr. Spicer: No, that is just a routine briefing.",1354.72,1.701
"But because of the nature of it, it&amp;#39;s happening in",1356.421,1.769
the Situation Room.,1358.19,0.7
"The Press: But is that with staff, or is that with --",1358.89,2.436
Mr. Spicer: Staff.,1361.326,0.534
"The Press: Okay, so it&amp;#39;s not with, like, the",1361.86,1.235
principals committee.,1363.095,0.8
Mr. Spicer: No.,1363.895,1.335
The Press: When do you anticipate the first,1365.23,1.368
formal meeting of the National Security Council?,1366.598,1.935
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think General McMaster got",1368.533,2.436
"here at noon today, so --",1370.969,0.701
(laughter),1371.67,2.836
"-- we move fast, but I think that we need to give",1374.506,2.97
him a few days probably to get his team together.,1377.476,2.302
So the President was obviously very pleased,1379.778,3.67
with the selection.,1383.448,0.668
I think when you saw the bipartisan support that,1384.116,2.802
General McMaster received from the variety of the,1386.918,3.637
political spectrum -- people who have served,1390.555,2.97
"Republicans and Democrats, academics, pundits,",1393.525,3.437
columnists -- you know that he made an,1396.962,1.935
outstanding choice.,1398.897,1.201
"We want to get him in, show him around the office",1400.098,2.836
"a little bit, and then get him going.",1402.934,1.702
"But when we have a date to announce the next meeting,",1404.636,2.836
we&amp;#39;ll let you know.,1407.472,0.668
"The Press: The joint address for next week,",1408.14,2.168
what&amp;#39;s the President&amp;#39;s goal for that address?,1410.308,1.969
Mr. Spicer: I think that -- I&amp;#39;ll have a further,1412.277,2.135
"update as the week goes on, and we&amp;#39;ll have briefings.",1414.412,2.036
The President is going to lay out I think two main,1416.448,2.069
things -- where we&amp;#39;ve come and where we&amp;#39;re going.,1418.517,2.802
I think that he is very pleased with the progress,1421.319,3.07
"that he has made so far in the first month in office,",1424.389,2.636
and I think it&amp;#39;s an opportunity to remind,1427.025,2.035
members of Congress and the American people what,1429.06,2.436
"he promised them on the campaign trail, what he&amp;#39;s",1431.496,2.536
done already in a very significant way to achieve,1434.032,4.238
"and fulfill those promises that he made, but also",1438.27,1.935
talk about the challenges that we have as a nation,1440.205,3.37
and where we&amp;#39;re going.,1443.575,1.034
And that&amp;#39;s everything from our relationship with,1444.609,3.737
other countries in this world to some of the,1448.346,1.435
"various domestic problems that we face, the",1449.781,3.437
"challenges that we face in cities, health",1453.218,2.469
"care, education.",1455.687,0.968
But the President wants to make sure that the,1456.655,2.469
American people have a very clear indication as,1459.124,2.602
to where he&amp;#39;s taking this country and why he&amp;#39;s going,1461.726,2.703
to enact the policies he&amp;#39;s going to enact.,1464.429,1.668
John.,1466.097,0.968
"George, I&amp;#39;m sorry.",1467.065,1.902
"The Press: Thanks a lot, Sean.",1468.967,1.168
Let me ask you a question about the Vice President&amp;#39;s,1470.135,3.737
European trip.,1473.872,0.634
I&amp;#39;m curious whether he received any commitments,1474.506,3.07
from our European allies to commit more in terms of,1477.576,4.938
their financial contribution to NATO.,1482.514,1.635
Mr. Spicer: I think several of them -- I saw,1484.149,3.67
"Chancellor Merkel&amp;#39;s comments previous to that,",1487.819,3.07
noting that they understand that the U.S.,1490.889,2.269
is asking for that commitment.,1493.158,2.102
"Look, we&amp;#39;re one of the only countries -- there&amp;#39;s",1495.26,2.002
"a handful -- that are doing what NATO requires,",1497.262,3.103
which is 2 percent of GDP.,1500.365,1.635
"Some of them are at 1.2, 1.3, 1.5, and some of them",1502,2.87
are below that.,1504.87,0.767
But we&amp;#39;ve got to ask them to do what they agreed to do.,1505.637,5.005
And I think we&amp;#39;ve had a very positive reaction,1510.642,2.402
from most of these NATO countries that understand,1513.044,2.903
that the financial agreement that they agreed,1515.947,1.869
to is something that they need to live up to.,1517.816,2.069
And I think the Vice President continued to,1519.885,1.968
"receive assurances, much like the President has",1521.853,2.002
"through his foreign leader calls, where people not",1523.855,2.269
only understand it but are willing to follow,1526.124,1.401
through on it.,1527.525,0.701
"The Press: So it&amp;#39;s an ongoing process, or --",1528.226,1.602
"Mr. Spicer: Of course it&amp;#39;s an ongoing -- I mean, I",1529.828,1.068
think we need to follow up to make sure that the,1530.896,2.135
commitments that they&amp;#39;re making on the phone or in,1533.031,2.202
"person, in the case of the Vice President,",1535.233,1.535
are followed up.,1536.768,0.667
Dave.,1537.435,0.835
"The Press: Sean, thanks.",1538.27,0.6
The DHS memos today -- obviously these,1538.87,3.837
"immigration enforcement efforts cost money,",1542.707,2.903
hiring more agents.,1545.61,1.402
Mr. Spicer: Right.,1547.012,0.5
The Press: Do you envision that the current budget is,1547.512,2.002
"sufficient, or are you going to need to go to",1549.514,1.268
Congress for more money?,1550.782,0.701
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, I think right now ICE and DHS in",1551.483,1.468
"particular, as well as CBP, are looking at what",1552.951,4.972
this is going to cost and how much and putting a,1557.923,1.701
"request together, and then figuring out how much can",1559.624,2.269
be handled through reallocation of resources,1561.893,1.668
"and how much we can save maybe in another area, but",1563.561,2.837
then also work with Congress.,1566.398,0.934
"The Press: One other subject, different matter.",1567.332,1.034
There was an election report out today that the,1568.366,3.971
President raised more small campaign donations,1572.337,2.436
in 2016 than either Hillary Clinton and Bernie,1574.773,2.636
Sanders combined.,1577.409,0.901
Did he have a reaction to that?,1578.31,1.801
Has he seen that?,1580.111,1.035
"Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know, and I would ask you to",1581.146,1.802
probably go through the RNC for that.,1582.948,1.334
That&amp;#39;s a political matter that we generally,1584.282,1.635
don&amp;#39;t discuss.,1585.917,1.301
Yeah.,1587.218,0.668
"The Press: Sean, the National Center for",1587.886,2.602
"Transgender Equality, citing reliable sources,",1590.488,1.869
says the Trump administration today will,1592.357,2.536
rescind Obama-era guidance requiring schools to allow,1594.893,2.202
transgender kids to use the restroom consistent,1597.095,2.169
with their gender identity.,1599.264,0.734
Will the Trump administration rescind,1599.998,1.201
that guidance?,1601.199,1.001
Mr. Spicer: Right now that&amp;#39;s an issue that the,1602.2,2.402
Department of Justice and the Department of,1604.602,1.469
Education are addressing.,1606.071,1.067
I would tell you that -- and I think that there,1607.138,2.169
will be further guidance coming from DOJ in,1609.307,2.169
particular with respect to not just the executive,1611.476,2.97
"order, but also the case that&amp;#39;s in front of the",1614.446,1.468
Supreme Court.,1615.914,1.034
The President has maintained for a long time,1616.948,3.971
that this is a states&amp;#39; rights issue and not one,1620.919,2.569
for the federal government.,1623.488,1.134
So while there will be further guidance coming,1624.622,3.003
"out on this, I think that all you have to do is look",1627.625,2.236
at what the President&amp;#39;s view has been for a long,1629.861,1.735
time -- that this is not something that the federal,1631.596,2.97
government should be involved in; this is a,1634.566,1.368
states&amp;#39; rights issue.,1635.934,0.667
Matt.,1636.601,0.667
The Press: In the wake of the Vice President&amp;#39;s trip,1637.268,2.169
"to Europe, there&amp;#39;s questions as to the",1639.437,1.969
administration&amp;#39;s position on the future of the,1641.406,2.803
European Union with regard to a number of political,1644.209,2.369
movements across the continent advocating for,1646.578,3.27
the disbandment eventually of the European Union.,1649.848,2.469
I wanted to see if you could clarity the,1652.317,1.535
administration&amp;#39;s position on the future of the,1653.852,2.435
European Union.,1656.287,0.568
Mr. Spicer: I think the Vice President had great,1656.855,2.302
meetings with several European Union leaders and,1659.157,2.603
made it very clear to them that we&amp;#39;ll continue to,1661.76,5.305
"work with them, and reaffirmed our commitment",1667.065,2.169
to working with these nations.,1669.234,1.034
"I mean, there&amp;#39;s no update on that.",1670.268,2.703
Cecilia.,1672.971,0.534
The Press: Thank you.,1673.505,0.3
"On immigration, on the DHS memo, two parts, if I may.",1673.805,2.736
Is one of the goals here mass deportation?,1676.541,3.37
"Mr. Spicer: No, not at all.",1679.911,2.035
"This isn&amp;#39;t -- look, I think what we have to get",1681.946,2.636
back to is understanding a couple things.,1684.582,2.903
There&amp;#39;s a law in place that says if you&amp;#39;re in,1687.485,2.336
"this country illegally, that we have an obligation",1689.821,3.337
to make sure that the people who are in our,1693.158,2.102
country are here legally.,1695.26,1.968
What the order sets out today is ensures that the,1697.228,3.237
million-or-so people that have been adjudicated,1700.465,1.535
"already, that ICE prioritizes, creates a",1702,4.337
"system of prioritization, and makes sure that we",1706.337,4.305
walk through that system in a way that protects,1710.642,1.735
this country.,1712.377,0.901
This is consistent with everything the President,1713.278,2.002
"has talked about, which is prioritizing the people",1715.28,3.17
who are here who represent a threat to public safety,1718.45,3.036
or have a criminal record.,1721.486,1.201
And all this does is lay out the exact procedures,1722.687,2.469
to make sure that that subgroup of people who,1725.156,3.904
pose a threat to our nation because of a,1729.06,2.136
conviction or a violation of public safety or have a,1731.196,3.637
criminal record are adjudicated,1734.833,1.701
first and foremost.,1736.534,0.768
"That&amp;#39;s it, plain and simple.",1737.302,1.067
The Press: So is then -- a follow-up to that.,1738.369,1.736
Is the White House&amp;#39;s message to date to,1740.105,2.669
undocumented people in this country whose only,1742.774,2.135
"crime is being in this country illegally, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t",1744.909,4.104
"worry, or you&amp;#39;re on notice&amp;quot;?",1749.013,1.902
"Mr. Spicer: No, the message from this White",1750.915,1.769
House and from the DHS is that those people who are,1752.684,3.336
in this country and pose a threat to our public,1756.02,2.269
safety or have committed a crime will be the first to,1758.289,3.337
go and we will be aggressively making sure,1761.626,2.236
that that occurs.,1763.862,1.134
That is what the priority is.,1764.996,1.435
The Press: What about the others who aren&amp;#39;t?,1766.431,1.601
They&amp;#39;re watching this fearful right now.,1768.032,1.802
"Mr. Spicer: Cecilia, the President has said",1769.834,2.236
multiple times that we&amp;#39;ve got to look at this issue,1772.07,3.603
"on a very, very holistic way.",1775.673,1.869
And the number-one priority when you look at,1777.542,1.635
the scope of how many people are in the country,1779.177,2.069
"illegally, the number-one priority is making sure",1781.246,2.769
that people who pose a threat to this country are,1784.015,2.302
immediately dealt with.,1786.317,0.768
And this is not a small group of people; we&amp;#39;re,1787.085,1.735
talking close to a million people who have already,1788.82,2.035
been adjudicated and had their status processed,1790.855,3.237
through a formal due process system.,1794.092,4.771
And so what we need to do now is to make sure that,1798.863,3.237
we focus the resources and the efforts on those,1802.1,2.102
people going first and foremost.,1804.202,1.368
And the factsheet and the information that we put,1805.57,2.502
"out lays that out very, very clearly what",1808.072,3.637
is being done.,1811.709,0.668
"But for so long, the people at ICE and CBP had",1812.377,2.836
their hands cuffed behind them.,1815.213,1.268
And when they were going to deal with the mission,1816.481,2.402
"of their job, the last administration had so many",1818.883,2.469
carve-outs for who could be and who couldn&amp;#39;t be,1821.352,1.836
adjudicated that it made it very difficult for the,1823.188,2.302
customs and enforcement people to do their job and,1825.49,2.536
enforce the laws of this country.,1828.026,1.868
"But right now, what we&amp;#39;ve done is to make sure that",1829.894,2.169
they have the ability and the guidance and the,1832.063,3.036
resources to do what their mission is.,1835.099,3.337
"And that&amp;#39;s it, plain and simple.",1838.436,1.635
And the President is consistent with his,1840.071,2.002
priority of making sure that those people who pose,1842.073,2.169
a threat to this country are the first ones to go.,1844.242,2.903
Alexis.,1847.145,1.868
"The Press: Sean, on immigration, just to",1849.013,2.169
"follow up, the President has a carve-out",1851.182,1.602
himself for DACA.,1852.784,1.701
Mr. Spicer: Yeah.,1854.485,0.935
The Press: Can you explain the process -- expand on,1855.42,2.369
what you were saying on Thursday about the process,1857.789,1.768
that the administration is taking to decide --,1859.557,3.937
Mr. Spicer: And this is what I was basically,1863.494,2.436
"talking to Cecilia about, which is the President has",1865.93,3.27
"made clear when you have 12, 14, 15 million people",1869.2,3.037
"in the country illegally, that there has to be a",1872.237,3.937
system of priority.,1876.174,1.168
"And right now, ICE&amp;#39;s priority is going to make",1877.342,2.969
sure that we focus first and foremost on that.,1880.311,3.003
"Specifically, in the guidance, it talks about",1883.314,2.536
"the DACA and DAPA, unless someone who fits under",1885.85,3.504
that program fits into the sub-category is not,1889.354,4.437
subject to what is being dealt with now.,1893.791,2.069
"Remember, everybody who is here illegally is subject",1895.86,4.671
to removal at any time.,1900.531,1.202
"That is consistent with every country, not just ours.",1901.733,3.27
"If you&amp;#39;re in this country in an illegal manner, that",1905.003,4.371
obviously there&amp;#39;s a provision that could,1909.374,2.035
ensure that you be removed.,1911.409,1.568
But the priority that the President has laid forward,1912.977,2.536
and the priority that ICE is putting forward through,1915.513,2.035
DHS&amp;#39;s guidance is to make sure that the people who,1917.548,2.536
have committed a crime or pose a threat to our,1920.084,2.303
"public safety are the priority of their efforts,",1922.387,2.936
first and foremost.,1925.323,1.001
Katelyn.,1926.324,0.667
The Press: John Kasich --,1926.991,0.801
The Press: Let me follow.,1927.792,1.134
"The President has also, and his team has also had",1928.926,4.171
reservations about undocumented people in the,1933.097,4.605
United States who are beneficiaries of public,1937.702,2.536
"assistance or access to benefits, either at the",1940.238,5.939
state or the federal level.,1946.177,0.901
What is the President going to be doing to,1947.078,1.602
either issue guidance or executive action of some,1948.68,4.371
sort to indicate that he would like to preclude,1953.051,3.069
that from continuing?,1956.12,1.635
Mr. Spicer: I think we have talked in the past,1957.755,3.037
about the respect that the President has for taxpayer,1960.792,2.536
money with respect to sanctuary cities and the,1963.328,2.502
enforcement measures that he&amp;#39;s putting,1965.83,1.335
forward on immigration.,1967.165,1.801
"Right now, obviously, the actions today are focused",1968.966,3.838
on people who are in this country and what we need,1972.804,3.103
to do on our southern border to facilitate the,1975.907,2.736
building of the wall that he&amp;#39;s talked about.,1978.643,1.368
So we&amp;#39;re doing this one step at a time in a very,1980.011,3.804
"methodical way, and right now the focus is to make",1983.815,2.602
sure that ICE and CBP and DHS have the authority and,1986.417,4.972
the resources to carry out that first mission.,1991.389,2.035
We will have more -- and then continues to see that,1993.424,2.369
immigration is one of those issues that he was,1995.793,1.869
"very, very clear and consistent on in the",1997.662,1.702
"campaign, and we&amp;#39;re going to continue to implement",1999.364,2.268
the policies that he talked about to,2001.632,1.602
keep the country safe.,2003.234,0.667
Katelyn.,2003.901,0.801
The Press: Thank you.,2004.702,0.501
John Kasich has been a very vocal critic of,2005.203,2.169
"President Trump, even in the campaign, saying his",2007.372,2.068
"immigration plan was crazy, his statement that",2009.44,2.603
"the elections were rigged was silly, and he did not",2012.043,2.736
endorse him and did not vote for him.,2014.779,1.435
What is the President hoping to accomplish with,2016.214,2.035
their meeting at the White House on Friday?,2018.249,3.403
"Mr. Spicer: So, Governor Kasich has reached out on",2021.652,2.47
multiple occasions to meet with the President to,2024.122,1.968
"follow on, and the President has shown",2026.09,3.804
through the transition and since his time in office,2029.894,4.204
that he wants to meet with anybody that can help move,2034.098,3.837
this country forward and share in his vision.,2037.935,1.569
"I think that includes people who are with him,",2039.504,3.103
"who are not with him, who are on the other side of",2042.607,2.769
"the aisle, who are independents, union",2045.376,1.568
"workers, business leaders.",2046.944,2.47
"Now that he is President -- and, frankly, I would",2049.414,2.669
again date it back to the transition -- he,2052.083,2.402
understands that he&amp;#39;s the President for,2054.485,1.335
every American.,2055.82,0.867
And he&amp;#39;s talked consistently about having,2056.687,1.736
a united country.,2058.423,1.134
"And you do that by bringing people together,",2059.557,1.702
"whether or not they agree with you on every issue,",2061.259,2.169
or one or two issues.,2063.428,2.102
But if there&amp;#39;s common ground that can be found,2065.53,2.235
"to move the country forward, then great.",2067.765,1.669
And I think so many of the President&amp;#39;s priority,2069.434,2.369
issues are issues that Ohio is dealing with and,2071.803,3.903
that he wants to make sure that he can continue to,2075.706,2.303
work with Governor Kasich so that every,2078.009,2.702
American benefits.,2080.711,1.969
April.,2082.68,1.568
The Press: Did Kasich ask for the meeting?,2084.248,1.769
Mr. Spicer: Yes.,2086.017,0.567
"The Press: Okay, what did the President gain from",2086.584,3.57
his tour today?,2090.154,1.935
"You talked about where he visited, the exhibits",2092.089,3.504
that he visited.,2095.593,1.568
Did he also visit slavery?,2097.161,2.236
"And the reason why I&amp;#39;m asking is, is because when",2099.397,2.569
"he was candidate Trump, he said things like &amp;quot;we made",2101.966,3.971
"this country,&amp;quot; meaning white America, and not",2105.937,3.503
necessarily black.,2109.44,0.934
Did he gain --,2110.374,0.534
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know why you would say that.,2110.908,1.001
What do you mean?,2111.909,0.601
"The Press: No, no, no, he said that.",2112.51,1.301
I heard him say that.,2113.811,0.868
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, but look -- the answer to your",2114.679,1.902
question is -- one of the first exhibits that he,2116.581,2.802
visited was one of the slavery exhibits.,2119.383,2.103
And the director walked him through some very,2121.486,5.238
amazing stories and statistics about where,2126.724,2.936
"slavery was prevailing, not just in traditional",2129.66,2.603
Southern colonies but throughout the country.,2132.263,2.636
So they did have a very robust discussion about,2134.899,2.703
slavery early on in the tour.,2137.602,2.002
And I think that it was a very eye-opening and,2139.604,5.372
"powerful tour for him, and, frankly,",2144.976,3.27
for every American.,2148.246,0.8
And I would encourage any American that can find the,2149.046,3.637
"time and get in, because it&amp;#39;s so popular.",2152.683,4.505
But it really is enlightening as far as,2157.188,3.403
parts of our history that people may not fully,2160.591,2.503
"appreciate or know, and the contributions and the",2163.094,1.835
sacrifices that so many Americans have made that,2164.929,4.471
are a critical piece to our history that sometimes,2169.4,1.702
don&amp;#39;t get the attention they deserve.,2171.102,1.334
So I think the President walked away from there --,2172.436,3.07
and I mentioned in the remarks that he mentioned,2175.506,2.369
"to Lonnie that he wanted to come back, because you",2177.875,2.87
can&amp;#39;t do it justice.,2180.745,2.135
And it&amp;#39;s much like the Holocaust Museum where you,2182.88,2.636
go through it once and then you sit there and,2185.516,1.935
"start thinking of all the things that you saw, and",2187.451,2.703
"think, you know, I&amp;#39;d like to go back and more fully",2190.154,1.502
explore what I saw because it piqued some degree of,2191.656,4.571
interest or intellectual curiosity.,2196.227,2.669
But he was very taken aback.,2198.896,1.001
"It&amp;#39;s a very, very powerful institution and tour, and",2199.897,4.505
it covers a lot of ground.,2204.402,1.368
I think he was really proud to share it with,2205.77,3.47
Dr. Carson.,2209.24,0.801
"I mean, when you walk through that museum and",2210.041,1.968
"you see all of the elements of our history,",2212.009,2.303
when you walk up to this one glass exhibit that is,2214.312,4.237
"Dr. Carson&amp;#39;s scrubs and pictures of him, and to",2218.549,3.804
experience that with him and his wife for the first,2222.353,2.369
"time, and you realize how amazing that is for any",2224.722,4.705
"American to be part of a Smithsonian, and you&amp;#39;re",2229.427,3.336
standing with Dr. Carson and his wife where he is,2232.763,2.369
experiencing it with you for the first time and how,2235.132,2.503
"powerful that must have been was, I think, a real",2237.635,4.104
"interesting opportunity for him to sit there, hand",2241.739,5.272
"to hand, with another American and watch them be",2247.011,3.604
part of American history.,2250.615,2.302
And you also appreciate some of the real,2252.917,3.303
contributions that Dr. Carson has made to,2256.22,2.035
medicine and the depth and breadth of,2258.255,2.703
his accomplishments.,2260.958,2.302
"The Press: And lastly, kind of putting this with",2263.26,2.236
"the next question, is there any advancement on",2265.496,3.27
the CBC meeting with the President?,2268.766,1.568
"And also, the head of the CBC said he was wondering",2270.334,3.604
if the President saw anything from current and,2273.938,3.17
past members of the CBC while he was in the,2277.108,2.903
"museum, to get a little bit of information on them",2280.011,1.668
before this meeting happens.,2281.679,1.168
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;ll have further updates on that.,2282.847,2.435
"I know the President looks forward to that meeting,",2285.282,2.937
and I think that we&amp;#39;re in the process of trying to,2288.219,2.302
begin setting that up.,2290.521,1.935
And so I&amp;#39;ll have further updates on that,2292.456,4.271
once we get closer.,2296.727,0.734
I know that we&amp;#39;ve got some additional work before the,2297.461,2.903
month concludes on Historically Black,2300.364,2.369
"Colleges and Universities, and some meetings that",2302.733,1.802
we&amp;#39;re working on with them.,2304.535,0.801
But I want to get them locked in before I go further.,2305.336,2.469
The Press: What did he think about the members,2307.805,2.269
that he saw in the museum?,2310.074,1.735
"Mr. Spicer: Well, when you walk through one of them,",2311.809,1.768
"there&amp;#39;s a big jumbotron, and we paused for a while,",2313.577,4.071
and John Lewis was there giving a very powerful speech.,2317.648,2.77
And we just paused and watched that for,2320.418,1.868
a little while.,2322.286,0.667
"So, again, I think that, respectfully, when you",2322.953,3.237
walk through a museum like this there&amp;#39;s a lot of,2326.19,2.536
"moments where you&amp;#39;re just stopping and taking it in,",2328.726,4.004
"and there&amp;#39;s -- if you haven&amp;#39;t been there, you",2332.73,2.703
walk up this one ramp and they stop and there&amp;#39;s two,2335.433,2.435
"big screens, and one of them is a video screen,",2337.868,2.97
and it&amp;#39;s a massive jumbotron --,2340.838,1.301
The Press: The civil rights --,2342.139,1.268
Mr. Spicer: Right.,2343.407,0.434
And we watched the video of John Lewis talking,2343.841,3.537
there and describing his efforts in championing,2347.378,4.104
voting and civil rights.,2351.482,1.868
So I know the President paused and watched it and,2353.35,3.471
listened to it.,2356.821,1.568
"And again, I would just go back to how he described",2358.389,3.103
his overall -- we didn&amp;#39;t dissect the different,2361.492,2.636
"things, but I watched him and it was a very powerful",2364.128,3.103
"experience for him, and I know he looks",2367.231,1.335
forward to going back.,2368.566,0.667
Hallie.,2369.233,0.801
"The Press: Sean, two questions for you.",2370.034,0.967
First one on undocumented immigrants.,2371.001,2.103
You just made very clear that the President&amp;#39;s,2373.104,1.768
priority is to deport those who pose a threat,2374.872,3.837
to public safety.,2378.709,0.968
Mr. Spicer: Correct.,2379.677,0.567
The Press: I know you&amp;#39;re familiar with the case in,2380.244,0.801
"Arizona of the mother, Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos.",2381.045,2.069
Is she a threat to this country?,2383.114,1.635
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m going to leave that up to ICE.,2384.749,0.967
We don&amp;#39;t get involved from the White House,2385.716,2.569
to particular cases.,2388.285,1.202
That&amp;#39;s not --,2389.487,0.634
The Press: But she&amp;#39;s a symbol --,2390.121,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: You&amp;#39;re right, and I understand.",2390.788,1.134
The Press: But is she a threat to public,2391.922,0.968
"safety, though?",2392.89,1.201
"Mr. Spicer: But, Hallie, I think the answer is, is",2394.091,2.403
that ICE determined that she had violated the law,2396.494,2.969
in a way that was in accordance with this.,2399.463,2.202
"Again, we&amp;#39;ve got to go back to this idea that our",2401.665,3.304
"job, especially here at the White House, isn&amp;#39;t to",2404.969,2.969
"call balls and strikes and say, well, this person",2407.938,1.802
"only violated part of the law, or let them go on this.",2409.74,3.003
"If this was any other subject, if this was tax",2412.743,2.803
"evasion and we said, well, they only really violated",2415.546,1.868
a little bit of -- they only cheated on their,2417.414,2.136
"taxes a little, you wouldn&amp;#39;t be saying hey,",2419.55,2.502
should they really be going to be prison or,2422.052,1.469
should they be getting a fine?,2423.521,1.134
"At some point, laws are laws.",2424.655,1.301
"And if people have a problem with the law,",2425.956,2.97
"whether it&amp;#39;s at the local, state or federal issue,",2428.926,1.902
then we should petition our lawmakers and the,2430.828,3.103
executive at that particular branch of,2433.931,1.735
government and change it.,2435.666,1.435
But our job shouldn&amp;#39;t be to figure out should this,2437.101,3.003
"individual not have to abide by the law, should",2440.104,1.768
this individual get a pass.,2441.872,2.303
"If we want to change the law, we&amp;#39;ve got a very",2444.175,2.535
amazing process here in this country to both,2446.71,2.536
create and change laws.,2449.246,1.969
And so I don&amp;#39;t want to comment on the specifics,2451.215,2.369
of any one case because I think that then puts the,2453.584,3.403
White House in a position of deciding who is,2456.987,2.403
"following the law and who isn&amp;#39;t, and who",2459.39,2.502
should get a pass.,2461.892,0.901
The bottom --,2462.793,0.534
The Press: But isn&amp;#39;t it different from you,2463.327,1.368
just said of prioritization of cases?,2464.695,1.468
There&amp;#39;s a difference --,2466.163,0.601
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, there&amp;#39;s a difference.",2466.764,0.667
"When you have 13 or 14 million people, they&amp;#39;re in",2467.431,2.536
"the country -- you know, I think it&amp;#39;s one thing to",2469.967,1.468
say prioritize people who pose a threat to public,2471.435,2.636
safety and go after this individual or that,2474.071,2.569
"individual, or whatever.",2476.64,2.169
"There&amp;#39;s no question, you have to have priorities in",2478.809,2.803
"anything -- what do you do first, what do",2481.612,1.735
"you do second, what do you do third.",2483.347,1.401
"And when you&amp;#39;re talking about, 13, 14, 15,",2484.748,1.735
"potentially more, millions of people in this country,",2486.483,3.371
"the President needed to give guidance, especially",2489.854,1.935
after what they went through in the last,2491.789,1.334
administration where there were so many carve-outs,2493.123,2.269
that ICE agents and CBP members had to figure out,2495.392,3.571
each individual whether or not they fit in a,2498.963,1.601
particular category and they could adjudicate,2500.564,2.136
that case.,2502.7,0.667
The President wanted to take the shackles off,2503.367,1.335
individuals in these agencies and say: You have,2504.702,3.803
"a mission, there are laws that need to be followed;",2508.505,2.47
you should do your mission and follow the law.,2510.975,2.669
"And for specific cases, I would refer you to ICE in",2513.644,2.102
particular and do that.,2515.746,1.101
"The Press: Sean, where did you get the 13 and 14",2516.847,1.568
million number?,2518.415,1.235
"Mr. Spicer: Hold on, Hallie is on number two.",2519.65,1.068
The Press: Thank you.,2520.718,2.569
"The Press: The 13, 14 million number -- where",2523.287,0.567
did you get that number?,2523.854,0.367
"Mr. Spicer: Glenn, will you please not interrupt her?",2524.221,2.202
The Press: Do you want to take that now?,2526.423,2.369
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, I think -- I&amp;#39;m not going to",2528.792,1.368
allow you to be interrupted.,2530.16,0.735
The Press: So the second question is on the,2530.895,2.002
anti-Semitism comments that you referenced from,2532.897,3.069
"the podium, the President made very clear.",2535.966,1.702
"You said, though, that he has taken opportunities",2537.668,2.169
in the past.,2539.837,0.567
"Just last week, though, he had the opportunities to",2540.404,2.202
deliver a message to the American people,2542.606,1.702
about anti-Semitism.,2544.308,0.934
He made very clear he was not anti-Semitic and he,2545.242,2.069
"was, in fact, insulted by that.",2547.311,2.035
But as far as a broader message to the American,2549.346,3.504
"people, he declined to offer one.",2552.85,1.701
Is the President comfortable with his,2554.551,1.669
obligation as the leader of this country to deliver,2556.22,2.436
that kind of broad and forceful message,2558.656,2.269
to Americans?,2560.925,0.767
"And if so, why didn&amp;#39;t he do it sooner in the case",2561.692,2.302
of these attacks?,2563.994,start=2563.994
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think the idea, Hallie,",2563.827,2.603
that -- he has.,2566.43,1.435
And I think there&amp;#39;s a point at which he talked,2567.865,2.469
literally on election night about uniting this,2570.334,2.302
"country and making sure that all Americans, et cetera.",2572.636,2.336
"And every time there&amp;#39;s an instance, it&amp;#39;s interesting",2574.972,2.469
"-- I mean, I get a question, &amp;quot;Is he going to",2577.441,1.702
"denounce this one, is he going to denounce this one?&amp;quot;",2579.143,1.735
"At some point, the question is asked",2580.878,2.069
and answered.,2582.947,0.667
He has stood very forcefully against --,2583.614,1.802
The Press: That&amp;#39;s not what I&amp;#39;m asking.,2585.416,1.334
I&amp;#39;m not asking --,2586.75,0.768
Mr. Spicer: What are you --,2587.518,0.7
"The Press: I&amp;#39;m asking, is he comfortable with his",2588.218,1.769
role as the person who needs to be delivering a,2589.987,3.036
"broader message to America, not denouncing",2593.023,1.769
"it, which he did clearly today.",2594.792,1.201
Mr. Spicer: Right.,2595.993,0.767
And I think that he is very comfortable and,2596.76,1.302
"understands that as the leader of the free world,",2598.062,2.335
"the President of this country, the",2600.397,1.335
"Commander-in-Chief, that he has an awesome",2601.732,1.635
responsibility to make it very clear where we&amp;#39;re,2603.367,3.87
"going as a country and what our values are, and",2607.237,1.869
that he has spoken very forcefully that we don&amp;#39;t,2609.106,2.769
"stand for this kind of behaviors, and words, and",2611.875,3.437
"intolerance, that we are a country that should bring",2615.312,1.902
people together and that we shouldn&amp;#39;t tolerate,2617.214,2.002
people who are hating on individuals because of,2619.216,3.437
their gender or because of their religion or the,2622.653,2.202
"color of their skin, or a variety of other things,",2624.855,2.769
but that there&amp;#39;s a point at which it&amp;#39;s,2627.624,2.169
asked and answered.,2629.793,0.801
And I think the President has been very clear over,2630.594,2.169
"and over again, going back through the campaign, the",2632.763,2.736
"transition and now, that that&amp;#39;s the kind of",2635.499,4.004
"President that he wants to be, that&amp;#39;s the kind of country that he wants to lead.",2639.503,1.835
Trey.,2641.338,0.668
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",2642.006,1.267
"Following the DHS memos this morning, the ACLU",2643.273,2.67
said the courts won&amp;#39;t allow these orders to,2645.943,1.968
become a reality.,2647.911,1.068
How is the administration preparing for another,2648.979,1.902
potential legal battle?,2650.881,1.135
And do you have any response to the ACLU?,2652.016,1.735
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think we have done a phenomenal",2653.751,3.169
"job of working with the various departments,",2656.92,2.903
"particularly DHS and DOJ, State, and through the",2659.823,4.672
"White House staff, to make sure that we are well",2664.495,5.272
within any concerns that the court might have.,2669.767,2.302
"And as I mentioned, I think it&amp;#39;s important to",2672.069,2.035
continue to emphasize we feel as though the first,2674.104,2.569
"one did that as well, and we were vindicated several",2676.673,3.371
times in the court.,2680.044,0.533
We have an issue with the 9th Circuit and I think we,2680.577,2.837
"will overcome that, ultimately, on the merits.",2683.414,1.234
"But in the meantime, a dual-track is something",2684.648,3.27
that we wanted to pursue to make sure that we do,2687.918,2.336
"everything we can, as I mentioned before, to",2690.254,1.568
keep the country safe.,2691.822,0.701
"The Press: Sean, thank you.",2692.523,1.167
"The Australian foreign minister is here today,",2693.69,5.606
meeting the Vice President.,2699.296,1.935

meeting the Vice President today and also the,2702.733,1.368
Secretary of State tomorrow.,2704.101,1.368
I guess we can assume that the U.S.-Australia refugee,2705.469,4.004
deal will come up.,2709.473,1.234
"Now, last time we spoke, the President was",2710.707,2.002
still considering and reviewing a deal.,2712.709,2.703
Can you just update us on what the current position is?,2715.412,2.87
Mr. Spicer: We&amp;#39;ll have a readout of that.,2718.282,0.801
The Press: And just --,2719.083,0.8
"Mr. Spicer: Okay, of course everyone gets two.",2719.883,1.335
(laughter),2721.218,2.469
The Press: If you could just update us on the,2723.687,2.136
current position on the deal.,2725.823,1.201
"And also, given that recent exposure on the",2727.024,3.003
"President&amp;#39;s distaste for it, will Australia be",2730.027,3.437
expected to return the favor?,2733.464,1.501
"Mr. Spicer: Look, again, I would wait.",2734.965,3.403
We&amp;#39;ll have a readout after that call as far as,2738.368,1.435
what they discussed.,2739.803,0.701
But I&amp;#39;ve got nothing -- I don&amp;#39;t want to get ahead of,2740.504,2.369

Secretary of State or the Vice President.,2744.508,1.668
Kristen.,2746.176,0.668
The Press: Thank you.,2746.844,0.6
I have two questions.,2747.444,1.001
"One, on the immigration refugee executive order",2748.445,3.57
"that we&amp;#39;re expecting in the coming days, so that",2752.015,3.237
"it withstands legal challenges, can you tell",2755.252,2.502
us what the language might look like as it relates to,2757.754,3.003
Syrian refugees?,2760.757,0.968
"Mr. Spicer: I appreciate the effort, but when we",2761.725,2.87
have it ready we&amp;#39;ll get it out.,2764.595,2.936
And I think part of this is --,2767.531,1.234
The Press: (Inaudible) ban,2768.765,0.801
on Syrian refugees?,2769.566,0.534
Mr. Spicer: Excuse me?,2770.1,0.467
"Again, I appreciate the second try, but we&amp;#39;re not",2770.567,3.671
ready to announce it.,2774.238,0.901
"And part of it is, is that we&amp;#39;re making sure that it",2775.139,1.868
is completely ready to go.,2777.007,4.104
"And so when we have that, we will get it out to you.",2781.111,2.77
And I would just -- the reason that we haven&amp;#39;t,2783.881,3.403
announced it is it&amp;#39;s not ready to be announced.,2787.284,2.002
The Press: I want to try one more on --,2789.286,2.002
Mr. Spicer: Of course.,2791.288,0.467
The Press: -- the comments that the President made,2791.755,1.235
today about anti-Semitism.,2792.99,1.001
"In terms of the timing, obviously he was asked",2793.991,2.302
"about it, but they also came after his daughter,",2796.293,2.736
"Ivanka, sent out that tweet.",2799.029,2.236
Has she counseled him?,2801.265,1.067
Was she one of the people saying it&amp;#39;s important for,2802.332,1.602
you to forcefully denounce this?,2803.934,1.501
Why today?,2805.435,0.835
Mr. Spicer: Because the President was visiting the,2806.27,2.769
"African American Museum, he wanted to make",2809.039,1.835
it very clear.,2810.874,0.668
"I think it was very powerful that, while",2811.542,1.935
"there, and while understanding the",2813.477,3.403
struggles of so many -- and we talk about how one,2816.88,3.137
of the beauties of history is that we,2820.017,1.334
don&amp;#39;t repeat itself.,2821.351,0.668
And I think that when you&amp;#39;re at a museum like,2822.019,2.536
that and seeing the struggles that so many,2824.555,3.303
"Americans faced and overcame, that you want to",2827.858,3.37
remind people that there is still issues that our,2831.228,2.703
country is grappling with and that there is no place,2833.931,3.036
for that hate and for that language.,2836.967,2.636
"And I think -- as I mentioned, it was a very",2839.603,1.868
powerful opportunity for him to say that and to,2841.471,3.37
"make clear, again, what his opinions were.",2844.841,2.103
"The Press: Does he regret not doing it last week, Sean?",2846.944,1.868
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sorry?,2848.812,0.534
The Press: Does he regret not stating this,2849.346,1.368
comment last week?,2850.714,0.534
Mr. Spicer: The President was very clear.,2851.248,0.534
"That was a very -- I think, as I mentioned to",2851.782,3.069
"Hallie, he has discussed this over and over again.",2854.851,2.87
I think there&amp;#39;s a point to which his position,2857.721,2.736
is abundantly clear.,2860.457,1.468
His attempts and his desire and his rhetoric to,2861.925,2.269
unite the country has been expressed over and over again.,2864.194,3.637
Sarah.,2867.831,0.467
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",2868.298,1.068
The New York Times is reporting that Trump&amp;#39;s,2869.366,2.703
budget director is preparing a budget that,2872.069,2.102
eliminates the Export-Import Bank.,2874.171,1.568
"But several lawmakers, including Senator",2875.739,2.603
"Heitkamp, have come out of private meetings with",2878.342,2.402
President Trump and said that in those private,2880.744,2.402
meetings he expressed support for the export bank.,2883.146,2.703
So which is it?,2885.849,1.101
Does he support Ex-Im or does he support,2886.95,2.036
eliminating it?,2888.986,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I can confirm that the OMB director --,2889.653,2.302
the budget director is working on a budget.,2891.955,1.969
(laughter),2893.924,2.302
"Beyond that, I&amp;#39;m not going to get ahead of the OMB",2896.226,3.47
director right now.,2899.696,0.768
"They are drafting a budget, they are talking",2900.464,1.902
to members of Congress and other interested parties,2902.366,3.837
"about funding levels and such, but we&amp;#39;re not at a",2906.203,3.036
position to go yet.,2909.239,1.201
Yes.,2910.44,0.467
"The Press: Sean, just wanted to circle on",2910.907,1.869
Alexis&amp;#39;s question.,2912.776,0.934
"Since the DHS guidance did not eliminate DACA, does",2913.71,3.737
"that mean that the program is remaining in place,",2917.447,1.869
that it&amp;#39;s a settled matter and it&amp;#39;s not going away?,2919.316,3.303
"Mr. Spicer: No, Jordan.",2922.619,1.301
What it means is that this particular enforcement is,2923.92,5.406
tailored to what I have been referencing over and,2929.326,2.369
over again -- that what we&amp;#39;re talking about today,2931.695,2.436
is the implementation of those two executive,2934.131,2.469
"orders, one specifically that&amp;#39;s tasking the",2936.6,3.637
agencies under DHS to address a very specific,2940.237,4.237
"problem of the million or so, plus or minus, people",2944.474,3.671
"that they have identified, that they have then",2948.145,1.501
adjudicated with already going through the process,2949.646,4.605
to be adjudicated and taken out of the country.,2954.251,2.335
The Press: That means a decision on DACA,2956.586,1.268
could come any day.,2957.854,0.734
"Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s right, exactly.",2958.588,1.669
"It just means that this -- what it means, more than",2960.257,1.334
"anything, is that this order does not address",2961.591,3.27
"that and it&amp;#39;s very clear in the Q&amp;amp;A -- and, again,",2964.861,2.503
I would refer you back to DHS&amp;#39;s website that,2967.364,2.469
has all of that.,2969.833,0.701
Goyal.,2970.534,0.367
The Press: Thank you very much.,2970.901,1.134
Two questions please.,2972.035,1.135
"One, it&amp;#39;s been one month on the job for you and for",2973.17,4.337
"the President, and you are already talk of the town",2977.507,2.436
around the globe.,2979.943,0.601
(laughter),2980.544,0.901
"My two questions are, one --",2981.445,3.203
Mr. Spicer: My wife would disagree with you.,2984.648,2.335
(laughter),2986.983,1.502
"It&amp;#39;s not always positive, too.",2988.485,1.435
"The Press: It looks like, Sean, that the President&amp;#39;s",2989.92,2.869
order is working at least around the globe because,2992.789,4.305
"more than 60,000 Pakistanis have been",2997.094,3.203
deported by Saudi Arabia.,3000.297,1.435
But they&amp;#39;re saying that they were illegals and,3001.732,2.836
also they&amp;#39;re a threat to the country.,3004.568,2.936
"And also, at the same time, Pakistani government",3007.504,2.269
is arresting hundreds of terrorists inside the country.,3009.773,4.671
Any presidential message?,3014.444,1.001
"Mr. Spicer: Look, I&amp;#39;m not going to -- there&amp;#39;s",3015.445,2.97
nothing that I have in terms of an update of,3018.415,1.802
what&amp;#39;s going on in Pakistan.,3020.217,1.501
I would refer you to the Department of State with,3021.718,1.669
respect to specific policies.,3023.387,2.235
But the broader point that you&amp;#39;re making is I think,3025.622,1.735
each country needs to look at what they need to do to,3027.357,3.637
control the people that are entering their country,3030.994,2.102
and keep their people safe.,3033.096,1.068
"When you look at our laws in particular, and compare",3034.164,3.57
them to so many other countries around the,3037.734,2.169
"globe, we actually tend to probably fall in the lower",3039.903,2.903
end of how tough our immigration policies are,3042.806,4.171
vis-à-vis someone else.,3046.977,1.468
"The Press: Sean, my second question.",3048.445,1.535
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sorry.,3049.98,0.534
The Press: As far as illegal immigrants are,3050.514,4.638
"concerned in the U.S., millions of illegal",3055.152,3.169
immigrants that were waiting for the last eight,3058.321,3.07
or ten years that they might see a light in the,3061.391,3.404
"dark tunnel, and now they&amp;#39;re hoping that",3064.795,3.536
President Trump will have a light for them.,3068.331,2.069
So what is the President&amp;#39;s message for them who are,3070.4,3.303
"in this country for five, 10, 15 or 20 years but",3073.703,2.87
they&amp;#39;re not -- they don&amp;#39;t have any criminal records?,3076.573,2.402
"Mr. Spicer: Well, look, the President has said",3078.975,2.403
before he&amp;#39;s got a big heart.,3081.378,1.568
And I think that as we continue to develop policy,3082.946,4.037
"on immigration, it&amp;#39;s going to be, as we&amp;#39;ve talked",3086.983,2.169
"about in the past, prioritized -- what we go",3089.152,2.102
"after first, second third.",3091.254,2.236
The President has made very clear he understands,3093.49,1.902
the plight of some of those individuals.,3095.392,3.236
He&amp;#39;s got a big heart.,3098.628,1.101
"He understands the impact it has on many families,",3099.729,3.637
many communities.,3103.366,1.769
But we will continue to develop policies that will,3105.135,4.171
address that.,3109.306,0.667
"And again, today&amp;#39;s focus is specifically on those",3109.973,3.67
"two executive orders, and I&amp;#39;m going to limit it to that.",3113.643,2.102
"The Press: Sean, at the beginning of the month,",3115.745,6.006
Senator John McCain sent a letter to the President,3121.751,1.469
requesting that the administration provide,3123.22,4.404
arms to Ukrainians fighting Russian,3127.624,2.169
separatists within their country.,3129.793,1.435
When will the President respond to Senator,3131.228,2.369
McCain&amp;#39;s letter?,3133.597,1.101
And what is the administration&amp;#39;s position,3134.698,1.768
on lethal aid to Ukrainians fighting,3136.466,3.237
Russian separatists?,3139.703,0.467
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t have anything for you on that.,3140.17,2.235
I&amp;#39;ll try to get back to you on that.,3142.405,1.335
I know that we&amp;#39;re very pleased to watch Senator,3143.74,2.102
McCain praise the pick of General McMaster.,3145.842,3.003
That&amp;#39;s obviously someone that we will consult with.,3148.845,2.236
But we were pleased to see so much support for him.,3151.081,3.003
Scott Newman .,3154.084,0.801
The Press: On Russia -- critics of the President,3154.885,3.036
have said that at time he doesn&amp;#39;t talk tough enough,3157.921,2.402
on the subject.,3160.323,1.001
"General McMaster, though, has been labeled by a lot",3161.324,3.003
of people as being pretty hawkish.,3164.327,1.101
"I&amp;#39;m curious what, if any, difference in tone or",3165.428,2.903
tenor or strategy we should expect now that,3168.331,2.069
they&amp;#39;re working together.,3170.4,0.734
"The Press: Well, I think, as I mentioned a couple",3171.134,3.504
"times, I think there is widespread praise for",3174.638,1.501
General McMaster and his understanding and command,3176.139,4.071
"of national security matters, foreign",3180.21,2.135
policy matters.,3182.345,0.734
He&amp;#39;s going to be a great asset to the President&amp;#39;s,3183.079,1.702
national security team.,3184.781,0.801
"But ultimately, the President has always been",3185.582,2.836
"the decider, whether it&amp;#39;s Russia or any other issue.",3188.418,2.035
"And I think you&amp;#39;re right, he has made it very clear",3190.453,2.203
"that if he can get a deal with Russia, something",3192.656,2.602
that the last several administrations have tried,3195.258,2.836
"to do, that he&amp;#39;s going to do it.",3198.094,1.569
"And if he can&amp;#39;t, he won&amp;#39;t.",3199.663,0.967
But he is going to try.,3200.63,1.669
And I think his success as a businessman and,3202.299,2.235
negotiator should be seen as a positive sign for him,3204.534,3.771
to be able to do that.,3208.305,1.101
But he understands that if he can find common ground,3209.406,3.069
"on defeating ISIS and combatting terrorism,",3212.475,2.403
growing the economy where we can find areas of,3214.878,2.636
"economic interest, then we&amp;#39;re going to do it.",3217.514,1.902
But that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re going to continue to work,3219.416,3.97
with Russia if we can.,3223.386,1.168
He&amp;#39;ll get a deal.,3224.554,0.701
"If he can&amp;#39;t, he won&amp;#39;t.",3225.255,0.834
But he&amp;#39;s going to try.,3226.089,1.502
"And I think where others have failed, he&amp;#39;s going to",3227.591,3.236
make sure that he does everything possible to,3230.827,2.336
make sure that if it&amp;#39;s in the interest of the United,3233.163,2.102
States he will get a deal.,3235.265,1.301
The Press: I have another question on General McMaster.,3236.566,2.77
So how much leeway is he going to get to,3239.336,2.035
"restructure, to bring on his own people?",3241.371,2.603
There were some reports that Admiral Harward was,3243.974,2.902
"not allowed to, or others as well.",3246.876,1.235
So can you address that?,3248.111,1.235
Mr. Spicer: Thank you.,3249.346,0.667
I can.,3250.013,0.601
He will have 100 percent.,3250.614,1.201
"The President has been very, very clear with that.",3251.815,2.969
"He is the National Security Advisor, and he",3254.784,3.27
will have whatever he needs to implement a,3258.054,4.271
successful team.,3262.325,2.803
But with respect to Admiral Harward that you,3265.128,1.401
"brought up, Admiral Harward made it very, very",3266.529,3.27
"clear that he wanted this job, he would love to take it.",3269.799,3.237
He was impressed with the team.,3273.036,2.469
"But during the course of discussions, it came up --",3275.505,2.269
"he said: Before I continue with this discussion, I",3277.774,2.903
need to address some financial and family concerns.,3280.677,3.17
"He went back, he came back to us and said, I am",3283.847,1.868
unable to continue the discussions because of,3285.715,2.536
there&amp;#39;s some financial concerns and some family,3288.251,2.136
issues that we have.,3290.387,0.667
I spent 40 years serving this country in the United,3291.054,2.302
States Navy.,3293.356,1.168
"I talked to him again Saturday night, and he",3294.524,1.902
"said: If there&amp;#39;s another opening in a year or two,",3296.426,2.302
"I would be honored, I am so impressed with the team",3298.728,2.069
that&amp;#39;s there.,3300.797,1.101
And I would urge people to actually talk to him.,3301.898,3.837
He was so excited about being part of the team.,3305.735,2.469
He was available to as many reporters as,3308.204,1.569
he could take.,3309.773,1.001
We gave out his information --,3310.774,1.568
his contact information.,3312.342,1.535
And he&amp;#39;s been very clear.,3313.877,0.934
He wrote a letter to the President prior to --,3314.811,2.436
first thing Tuesday morning.,3317.247,1.134
"He was in the UAE, he sent the letter over and we had",3318.381,2.77
"it first thing in the morning, where he said,",3321.151,1.735
"because of family concerns, because of some",3322.886,2.102
"financial constraints, having served this nation",3324.988,2.202
"for 40 years, I can&amp;#39;t take this job, but I&amp;#39;m",3327.19,4.371
unbelievably impressed.,3331.561,1.401
All of the rumors about the discretion that he,3332.962,3.771
would have over staff or any other thing were 100,3336.733,2.502
percent false.,3339.235,1.101
He&amp;#39;s made it clear that he would love to serve in the,3340.336,2.503
"future, that he was impressed with the team,",3342.839,2.302
that he wanted to do this.,3345.141,1.468
There were just some constraints financially,3346.609,2.036
and family-wise that come with -- or after having,3348.645,2.469
"served 40 years in the military, sacrifices both",3351.114,3.87
financially and family-wise that he,3354.984,1.335
had had to make.,3356.319,0.667
"But I talked to him several times, and the",3356.986,4.105
team has talked to him.,3361.091,0.8
"But ultimately, the President was very, very",3361.891,4.071
impressed with General McMaster.,3365.962,1.435
He had always been one of the individuals that he,3367.397,2.035
thought stood above so many other folks.,3369.432,4.672
"He was impressed with the entire list,",3374.104,1.635
John Bolton and others.,3375.739,4.27
But so many people had spoken to him.,3380.009,2.436
"General Mattis, Tom Cotton, other senators",3382.445,3.07
really praised General McMaster&amp;#39;s command of the,3385.515,3.036
"issues, his management, his style, his",3388.551,2.102
understanding of the geopolitical landscape.,3390.653,2.136
And I think that&amp;#39;s why you saw such amazing,3392.789,3.47
"widespread bipartisan praise for him, and why he",3396.259,3.303
will be such an asset to the national security team.,3399.562,3.704
"So, ultimately, we ended up with the best choice.",3403.266,4.638
And I think that&amp;#39;s going to benefit not just this,3407.904,1.668
administration but our entire nation.,3409.572,1.302
"The Press: Sean, can we expect him to get anyone",3410.874,1.668
else from the top of -- any senior people at the NSC?,3412.542,3.337
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sorry?,3415.879,0.333
The Press: Can we expect that he may replace any,3416.212,1.669
others in the NSC?,3417.881,0.634
"Mr. Spicer: Again, I just can&amp;#39;t be any clearer.",3418.515,0.867
I think that we&amp;#39;ve got an amazing team.,3419.382,1.368
He&amp;#39;s been impressed with them.,3420.75,1.435
"But the President has, as he did with other",3422.185,2.636
"candidates, told them that they would lead the team",3424.821,2.536
and that he would have the discretion of it.,3427.357,2.302
Jeff.,3429.659,0.667
The Press: I just wanted to follow on that.,3430.326,3.07
You said that he has the full authority to,3433.396,1.335
structure his office as he sees fit.,3434.731,1.802
"Does that extend to the principals committee, as well?",3436.533,2.002
After he comes in and takes a look at the whole,3438.535,2.402
