"Mr. Spicer: Good afternoon, everyone.",0,1.368
I wanted to wait until the President finished up with,1.368,2.035
his remarks on the budget before I came out.,3.403,2.636
"As you saw, he&amp;#39;s -- a really good opportunity to",6.039,2.669
sit down with his team.,8.708,0.768
It&amp;#39;s clearly been a busy day here at the White,9.476,2.869
"House again, so I&amp;#39;m going to kind of keep it quick",12.345,2.603
and get to your questions.,14.948,1.234
"This morning, after receiving his daily",16.182,1.869
"intelligence briefing, the President met with",18.051,1.401
Secretary of State Tillerson.,19.452,1.835
"As you all know, Secretary Tillerson and Secretary",21.287,2.069
Kelly will travel to Mexico City later today as,23.356,2.87
one of their first foreign trips.,26.226,1.501
It&amp;#39;s significant that the President is sending,27.727,2.269
the secretaries to Mexico,29.996,1.034
so early in the administration.,31.03,2.069
It&amp;#39;s symbolic of the meaningful relationship,33.099,4.204
that our two nations have.,37.303,1.669
These are important meetings regarding the,38.972,1.368
President&amp;#39;s agenda to improve the quality of,40.34,2.002
lives for people of Mexico and the United States by,42.342,4.671
combatting drug traffickers and finding,47.013,1.635
ways to bolster both our economies through a,48.648,3.07
broader relationship that promotes commerce,51.718,2.335
and legal immigration.,54.053,0.968
This is a very encouraging start to a working,55.021,2.603
relationship with an,57.624,1.234
incredible neighbor to the south.,58.858,2.536
"At this moment, the President has just wrapped",61.394,2.102
up his discussions on the federal budget with some,63.496,3.17
of the officials and staff who will be instrumental,66.666,2.603
in the work to put this country back on a,69.269,2.202
responsibly fiscal path.,71.471,2.002
"Joining the meeting were Reince Priebus, the Chief",73.473,3.203
"of Staff; Steve Bannon; Jared Kushner; Gary Cohn,",76.676,3.303
the Director of the National Economic Council;,79.979,1.735
Secretary Steve Mnuchin of the Department of,81.714,2.169
Treasury; Director Mulvaney of the Office of,83.883,2.436
Management and Budget; Russ Vought of the Office,86.319,2.402
of Management and Budget; and Emma Doyle of Office,88.721,2.269
of Management and Budget.,90.99,1.635
"As the President mentioned last week, we look forward",92.625,2.102
to presenting our tax reform plan and providing,94.727,2.436
much-needed tax reform and relief to the hardworking,97.163,4.238
men and women of our nation.,101.401,1.668
The President is going to restore and respect the,103.069,2.836
American taxpayer by enabling them to keep more,105.905,2.202
"of their hard-earned money, and by making sure",108.107,2.136
the federal government,110.243,0.767
spends money more responsibly.,111.01,2.136
"After the lunch, the President will continue",113.146,2.002
this important discussion with other members of the,115.148,2.536
senior staff.,117.684,1.301
"Additionally, the Vice President today is in",118.985,1.602
St. Louis to participate in listening sessions with,120.587,2.736
American workers and employees of the Fabick,123.323,2.435
"Cat equipment and engineer* [engine] dealer,",125.758,2.169
a 100-year-old family-owned and,127.927,2.169
operated business.,130.096,0.968
"During his visit, the Vice President will discuss the",131.064,2.402
economic comeback in store for our nation under the,133.466,2.836
President&amp;#39;s economic agenda and with small,136.302,3.037
business owners and employees.,139.339,1.701
The President has already made strides towards,141.04,1.936
slashing redundant regulations through his,142.976,2.536
"executive actions, and we will work with Congress to",145.512,2.135
enact further pro-growth legislation.,147.647,3.203
Back to the President&amp;#39;s schedule.,150.85,1.335
"Later this afternoon, the President will participate",152.185,1.802
in his standing legislative affairs,153.987,1.468
strategy session.,155.455,1.334
Our legislative affairs team is in constant,156.789,2.169
"contact with our counterparts on the Hill,",158.958,2.236
keeping an open dialogue on all aspects of the,161.194,2.602
President&amp;#39;s agenda.,163.796,1.335
"Last week alone, more than 40 different senators and",165.131,2.703
members of Congress visited the White House.,167.834,3.303
"On the Supreme Court front, so far Judge",171.137,1.869
Gorsuch has met with 58 senators -- 36 Republicans,173.006,3.904
and 22 Democrats -- and he has more meetings already,176.91,2.802
on the books for next week when the Senate,179.712,1.902
returns to session.,181.614,1.969
We&amp;#39;ve been especially encouraged by the,183.583,1.335
reception he&amp;#39;s received from several senior,184.918,1.635
"Democrats, including Senators Feinstein,",186.553,3.67
"Tester, Durbin, and Gillibrand.",190.223,2.002
"Also on the confirmation front, multiple unions",192.225,2.336
"came out today for Alex Acosta, the President&amp;#39;s",194.561,3.069
nominee for Labor Secretary.,197.63,1.402
Both the Laborers&amp;#39; International Union of,199.032,2.002
North America and the International Union of,201.034,2.302
Operating Engineers praised his distinguished,203.336,2.369
career and pledged their support,205.705,1.835
for his nomination.,207.54,1.668
The legislative affairs team is using the,209.208,1.569
congressional work period to coordinate with key,210.777,2.769
coalitions in Congress.,213.546,1.568
They are meeting with different groups in the,215.114,1.402
"House and Senate, including the staff of the",216.516,2.069
"Congressional Black Caucus, House and Senate",218.585,2.235
"leadership, and staff throughout various committees.",220.82,2.503
We&amp;#39;ve used this work period as an opportunity,223.323,2.269
to invite staffers from both sides of the aisle to,225.592,2.435
come to the White House and discuss shared,228.027,1.535
priorities and find common ground on the way forward.,229.562,4.004
And we&amp;#39;re not just reaching out to Capitol,233.566,1.335
"Hill, we&amp;#39;ve actively engaged with key leaders",234.901,1.835
and policymakers around the country.,236.736,1.869
It&amp;#39;s critical to this administration that we,238.605,1.568
gather input from states and from people throughout,240.173,2.936
"the country, rather than",243.109,0.868
just leaders here in Washington.,243.977,2.068
"Looking ahead to tomorrow, the President will meet",246.045,1.802
with a group of world-class business,247.847,1.368
leaders to discuss specific actions he can,249.215,2.77
take to remove barriers to job creation.,251.985,3.036
"These leaders, many of whom represent some of the",255.021,2.035
"country&amp;#39;s largest manufacturers, will begin",257.056,2.503
"the day in working groups with the Vice President,",259.559,2.436
Cabinet members and key,261.995,1.101
aides of the President&amp;#39;s staff.,263.096,2.102
The working groups will engage in a deep-dive,265.198,2.035
conversation on the attendees&amp;#39; specific,267.233,2.736
areas of expertise.,269.969,1.602
"Topics of discussion include deregulation, tax",271.571,2.702
"and trade, training and the workforce of the",274.273,2.303
"future, and infrastructure Vice President Pence will",276.576,3.003
be engaged with each of the groups.,279.579,1.701
"And after the groups conclude their discussion,",281.28,1.736
the President&amp;#39;s staff will compile the feedback and,283.016,2.469
the President will sit down with the entire group,285.485,2.035
for a listening session,287.52,1.001
on some of their recommendations.,288.521,1.802
"As you can tell by the structure of the meeting,",290.323,1.935
the President is expecting these interactions to lead,292.258,2.269
to real action being taken by the administration.,294.527,2.636
Creating a dynamic and booming economy that works,297.163,2.703
for all Americans continues to be at the top,299.866,2.369
of his domestic policy agenda.,302.235,2.035
"As a successful businessman himself, the",304.27,1.702
President knows that if we&amp;#39;re going to get the,305.972,1.334
"country back to work, we need to hear directly from",307.306,2.903
"job creators what is holding them back, and,",310.209,2.236
"where appropriate, take",312.445,0.934
steps to remove the barriers.,313.379,1.302
"In his first month in office, the President has",314.681,2.168
already taken numerous actions to boost job,316.849,1.902
"creation, and key economic indicators are showing",318.751,3.404
that it&amp;#39;s working.,322.155,0.934
"CEO and [consumer] confidence are up, the",323.089,2.636
"stock market continues to reach record highs, and",325.725,2.336
the January numbers were strong.,328.061,2.302
The meetings on Thursday will continue to build,330.363,1.702
on that momentum.,332.065,1.234
"And with that, I&amp;#39;m glad to take some questions.",333.299,1.902
Steve Holland.,335.201,1.101
THE PRESS: Steve Holland is not here.,336.302,1.835
"Mr. Spicer: Sorry, Jeff Mason gets it.",338.137,1.769
(Laughter.),339.906,0.667
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",340.573,1.568
Can you give us an update on the administration&amp;#39;s,342.141,3.27
plans with regard to transgender,345.411,1.835
bathrooms in schools?,347.246,1.101
And can you confirm that there has been some,348.347,3.27
disagreement between Secretary DeVos and the,351.617,2.203
Attorney General on this issue?,353.82,1.801
Mr. Spicer: So I would expect further guidance to,355.621,2.536
come out on that today.,358.157,0.901
"The President, as I said yesterday, is a firm",359.058,4.905
believer in states&amp;#39; rights.,363.963,1.869
When you look at the guidance that was issued,365.832,1.968
under the Obama administration -- first of,367.8,1.936
"all, let&amp;#39;s remember, to the best of my knowledge,",369.736,1.468
that was stalled and never fully implemented.,371.204,2.802
And I think there were various reasons for that,374.006,2.57
-- several legal reasons and several,376.576,1.468
procedural reasons.,378.044,1.435
And so the Department of Education and the,379.479,1.801
"Department of Justice, both who jointly issued",381.28,2.937
"that guidance back during the Obama administration,",384.217,2.936
are now working together again under a Trump,387.153,2.202
"administration, they&amp;#39;ve been reviewing the",389.355,2.169
"guidance that was signed, the basis by which",391.524,1.735
it was put through.,393.259,0.834
And I think there have been several areas of,394.093,2.036
"concern, both legal and procedural, that they have",396.129,4.204
been discussing.,400.333,0.734
And I think where you might be hearing something,401.067,3.136
is more on the timing and the wording of stuff.,404.203,2.97
"The conclusions, everybody in the administration",407.173,2.402
is agreed upon.,409.575,1.468
There is no daylight between anybody -- between,411.043,1.936
"the President, between any of the Secretaries.",412.979,1.802
I think there has been some discussion between,414.781,1.935
"the timing of the issuance and recommendations, or",416.716,4.871
between the exact wording.,421.587,0.968
"But as far as the conclusions go, I&amp;#39;ve made",422.555,2.97
this clear and the President has made it,425.525,1.334
clear throughout the campaign that he is a firm,426.859,1.735
believer in states&amp;#39; rights and that certain issues,428.594,2.036
like this are not best dealt with at,430.63,1.701
the federal level.,432.331,0.668
"The Press: Sean, a report out today that some",432.999,3.403
Cabinet Secretaries are bristling at what they see,436.402,3.137
as the White House micromanaging staffing at,439.539,2.736
the sub-Cabinet level.,442.275,1.268
To what degree does the White House think that it,443.543,1.801
should impose its hiring approvals on members of,445.344,4.038
the sub-Cabinet?,449.382,1.034
And is some of this at least partially driven by,450.416,4.738
Cabinet Secretaries wanting to appoint people,455.154,2.136
who might not necessarily be aligned with the,457.29,3.603
President&amp;#39;s thinking?,460.893,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I mean, I think when you come to",461.561,3.703
-- they&amp;#39;re called political appointees,465.264,1.435
for a reason.,466.699,1.034
The idea is that people who come into this,467.733,1.802
government should want to support and enact the,469.535,4.638
President&amp;#39;s agenda that he campaigned on with the,474.173,1.935
American people.,476.108,0.968
And I think one of the reasons that you see in,477.076,2.102
"recent polls the President -- people, even if they",479.178,2.069
"don&amp;#39;t agree with the President, they give him",481.247,1.668
high marks for following through on the promises,482.915,2.469
that he&amp;#39;s made to the American people and,485.384,1.969
"getting things done that he actually said, which is",487.353,2.369
not always the case here in Washington.,489.722,2.035
And I think that we want to make sure that the,491.757,2.303
people who staff a Trump administration are,494.06,2.736
"committed to a Trump agenda, and that&amp;#39;s -- so",496.796,4.104
Cabinet Secretaries and other administrators and,500.9,1.802
directors have broad discretion.,502.702,1.735
"But I think at the end of the day, no matter what",504.437,3.036
position you have -- whether it&amp;#39;s the lowest or,507.473,2.336
the highest in the White House or in a department,509.809,3.003
or agency -- we should be making sure that people,512.812,2.602
who are coming in as appointees of the,515.414,2.002
President support the President&amp;#39;s agenda.,517.416,2.87
And I think that&amp;#39;s one thing -- this isn&amp;#39;t about,520.286,2.269
getting a job as a federal employee where you&amp;#39;re,522.555,4.071
subject to certain restrictions as to what,526.626,2.736
you can and can&amp;#39;t do as a benefit of being,529.362,2.202
a federal employee.,531.564,0.901
"These are political appointees, and so I think",532.465,3.036
that there is obviously -- we are going to ensure,535.501,2.903
that people who are political appointees share,538.404,2.569
the vision and agenda that the President campaigned,540.973,2.336
on and is implementing.,543.309,1.134
The Press: And does the White House believe that,544.443,1.735
it needs to have the final approval of these people,546.178,3.304
or can you trust your Cabinet Secretaries to --,549.482,1.701
Mr. Spicer: It&amp;#39;s not a question of trust.,551.183,2.069
It&amp;#39;s a question of just making sure that we&amp;#39;re all,553.252,2.102
on the same page and committed to the same,555.354,2.836
agenda that the President has set forth.,558.19,2.47
This process is probably no different than we&amp;#39;ve,560.66,3.703
seen in previous administrations.,564.363,2.603
Cabinet Secretaries come to the President with,566.966,1.535
"recommendations on who they want, and it depends",568.501,2.636
"on the position, obviously.",571.137,2.202
"But in certain cases, if they&amp;#39;re going to fulfill a",573.339,4.104
job that is a key area that the President had,577.443,3.27
very specific goals to enact that he promised the,580.713,2.903
"American people, you want to make sure that the",583.616,1.902
person that is fulfilling that job actually is,585.518,2.436
committed to the agenda and the vision that the,587.954,1.501
President set forth and promised the American people.,589.455,2.369
And that&amp;#39;s -- so there is -- that&amp;#39;s something that,591.824,2.903
we&amp;#39;re always going to be making sure,594.727,1.401
is in alignment.,596.128,0.668
The Press: And is this approval process in some,596.796,2.068
way slowing down the appointment of,598.864,1.769
crucial staffers?,600.633,0.801
Mr. Spicer: No.,601.434,0.667
"No, not at all.",602.101,0.667
I don&amp;#39;t think so.,602.768,0.668
I think when you look across where we are and we,603.436,1.568
"track the number of folks that are in the pipeline,",605.004,2.469
"we&amp;#39;re doing very, very well with getting all of",607.473,2.636
these positions filled.,610.109,1.001
"And I think once in a while, you might hear of",611.11,1.702
"one or two people, but overall, generally",612.812,2.002
"speaking, I mentioned during the transition",614.814,1.968
period how many members of the beachhead teams that,616.782,1.702
"we had, and I think we -- those members who are",618.484,3.237
pointed through the beachhead process,621.721,1.434
had 120 days.,623.155,1.802
And they were there to allow basically a,624.957,2.636
four-month process for Secretaries in the White,627.593,2.736
House to make sure that people on a permanent,630.329,2.469
basis could populate those positions.,632.798,1.869
And that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening.,634.667,1.168
"But make no mistake -- I mean, we were ahead of the",635.835,1.635
curve on the beachhead teams.,637.47,1.067
We were very clear with the landing teams during,638.537,2.369
the transition.,640.906,0.901
This has been a very methodical process that,641.807,1.936
"has seen from top to bottom through, and I",643.743,2.168
think we&amp;#39;re doing a phenomenal job,645.911,1.335
of staffing the government.,647.246,0.667
Margaret.,647.913,0.668
The Press: Thank you.,648.581,1.034
"Oh, which Margaret?",649.615,1.068
"Mr. Spicer: Oh, lucky me.",650.683,1.768
(Laughter.),652.451,0.668
The Press: Two Margarets.,653.119,1.067
I&amp;#39;m going to take mine -- I&amp;#39;ve got a Bloomberg-y,654.186,3.537
question for you.,657.723,1.035
(Laughter.),658.758,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;ve got a Sean-y answer for you.,659.425,2.836
(Laughter.),662.261,0.701
The Press: The President in the Roosevelt Room,662.962,2.469
"just said to us that, among other things, that",665.431,4.104
the tax plan is nearly finalized but it can&amp;#39;t be,669.535,3.103
submitted until the healthcare plan,672.638,1.435
"statutorily or otherwise is, so we&amp;#39;re doing",674.073,2.035
the healthcare.,676.108,0.668
"So what I wanted to clarify was, is the White",676.776,2.802
"House doing a healthcare proposal, or was he",679.578,2.303
talking about Congress and not the White House?,681.881,3.537
Or is there a new plan?,685.418,1.067
"Mr. Spicer: Well, obviously -- right.",686.485,1.335
So obviously there&amp;#39;s two vehicles -- reconciliation,687.82,2.236
vehicles that -- FY17 -- I&amp;#39;m going to give you a,690.056,2.635
Bloomberg-y answer.,692.691,0.735
(Laughter.),693.426,1.034
"The FY17 reconciliation, that",694.46,2.536
was never completed because the budget wasn&amp;#39;t,696.996,2.569
finalized in the last Congress.,699.565,0.934
And then you&amp;#39;ve got the 2018.,700.499,1.669
I think we want to make sure -- look at the,702.168,1.334
"opportunities to work with Congress on Obamacare,",703.502,2.469
"utilizing the 2017, and then you could utilize the",705.971,2.803
2018 reconciliation and budget process,708.774,2.236
to do tax reform.,711.01,1.768
"That&amp;#39;s not -- and again, that&amp;#39;s not prescriptive.",712.778,1.468
I&amp;#39;m not -- but as far as why the President is,714.246,2.703
saying it that way is because we&amp;#39;ve got that,716.949,1.969
"option available to us right now, and I think the",718.918,2.302
President is committed to making sure that the,721.22,3.103
promise that he made to the American people to,724.323,2.136
repeal and replace Obamacare continues to be,726.459,2.102
"first and foremost, and then his tax plan.",728.561,2.569
But it&amp;#39;s not a &amp;quot;we can walk and chew gum&amp;quot;,731.13,2.669
kind of thing.,733.799,0.668
We can actually work with Congress and the,734.467,2.168
leadership in both Houses.,736.635,1.068
The Press: President Obama used to say that.,737.703,1.368
"Just to do the Bloomberg-y timeline, there&amp;#39;s a few",739.071,1.502
things that are going to happen then.,740.573,4.571
There&amp;#39;s going to be a budget plan that you guys,745.144,3.303
are going to present on March 13th-ish.,748.447,1.602
Mr. Spicer: Ish.,750.049,1.401
(Laughter.),751.45,0.668
The Press: There&amp;#39;s going to be a,752.118,3.136
healthcare -- this is where I got lost again --,755.254,2.97
"something from him and something from them, and a",758.224,1.635
tax reform plan afterwards?,759.859,0.934
Is that the way it works?,760.793,1.168
"Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t want -- look, when we&amp;#39;re ready",761.961,1.968
"to announce stuff -- but I think again, I think",763.929,1.502
"you&amp;#39;ve got Obamacare, the budget, and tax reform.",765.431,3.036
It&amp;#39;s going to be a very busy March and,768.467,2.469
April for us.,770.936,1.235
And we&amp;#39;ve been continuing to work with Congress to,772.171,2.002
make sure that that&amp;#39;s implemented.,774.173,1.568
Noah Bierman.,775.741,0.667
The Press: Does the President -- you were,776.408,3.104
talking about fulfilling his promises.,779.512,1.868
"As you know, he promised during the campaign a",781.38,1.902
total and complete shutdown of Muslims,783.282,2.236
entering the country.,785.518,1.368
There were a lot of people in his party who thought,786.886,2.569
that was a very good proposal.,789.455,1.835
Can you explain his evolution in backing,791.29,2.135
down from that?,793.425,1.001
And can you also say whether he regrets using,794.426,3.237
"that rhetoric, since it ended up hurting",797.663,1.935
the court case?,799.598,0.768
"Mr. Spicer: Well, again, I&amp;#39;d go back to the merits",800.366,2.469
of the case and the order that gives him the,802.835,3.603
authority to make that. U.S.,806.438,3.037
Code 1182 is very clear.,809.475,1.768
The President was very clear in his executive,811.243,2.036
order that these were countries that we didn&amp;#39;t,813.279,2.402
have the proper vetting for when it came to,815.681,3.837
ensuring the safety of Americans.,819.518,2.369
That&amp;#39;s what the executive order said.,821.887,2.002
The authority is very clear to have done it.,823.889,1.535
And I think that you&amp;#39;re going to continue to see,825.424,1.902
the President take the steps necessary to,827.326,1.935
protect this country.,829.261,1.135
That&amp;#39;s why he&amp;#39;s talked about fighting this on,830.396,3.103
"both fronts, making sure that we keep evolving",833.499,2.002
"through the court system on the existing EO, and",835.501,3.036
then looking towards the next draft of the,838.537,1.969
executive order that will continue to achieve the,840.506,2.569
goal of protecting the American people.,843.075,1.902
So that&amp;#39;s where we are.,844.977,1.501
That&amp;#39;s what the order says.,846.478,1.602
And then so I think we continue to feel confident,848.08,2.369
that that&amp;#39;s -- but it was crafted in a way that was,850.449,3.737
"very clear about the countries, and was not",854.186,3.17
focused on anything else but the vetting,857.356,2.169
requirements that we have to make sure that we know,859.525,3.103
who&amp;#39;s coming into this country and that they&amp;#39;re,862.628,1.435
here not to do us any harm.,864.063,1.801
The Press: But when talking about fulfilling,865.864,1.569
"his promises, can you explain why he decided to",867.433,2.335
back down from that one?,869.768,1.235
Because I know you differentiated this from,871.003,1.868
that promise.,872.871,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: I think he&amp;#39;s made it very clear, Noah,",873.539,2.569
from the beginning that this was a country-focused,876.108,2.136
"issue, a safety-focused issue, and that&amp;#39;s",878.244,1.768
why he issued it.,880.012,0.667
I don&amp;#39;t see anything other than that with,880.679,1.902
reference to that.,882.581,0.834
Debra Saunders.,883.415,0.701
The Press: Hi.,884.116,1.768
The Oscars are Sunday night.,885.884,3.003
Will the President be watching?,888.887,1.202
"If there&amp;#39;s a Meryl Streep kind of moment, how do you",890.089,5.672
think he&amp;#39;ll react?,895.761,0.901
And why -- if this has happened at other awards,896.662,2.402
"ceremonies, why do you think this happens?",899.064,1.702
Mr. Spicer: Why do I think what happens?,900.766,1.902
(Laughter.),902.668,0.667
The Press: Actresses and actors,903.335,2.102
like Meryl Streep.,905.437,0.668
Mr. Spicer: I have no idea.,906.105,1.535
It&amp;#39;s a free country.,907.64,1.801
I think Hollywood is known for being rather far to,909.441,2.903
the left in its opinions.,912.344,2.136
"And I&amp;#39;ve got to be honest with you, I think the",914.48,1.868
President will be hosting,916.348,1.335
the Governors Ball that night.,917.683,1.635
Mrs. Trump looks forward to putting on a phenomenal,919.318,1.802
"event, and the First Lady has put a lot of time into",921.12,3.603
this event that&amp;#39;s going to occur in welcoming our,924.723,2.236
nation&amp;#39;s governors to the Capitol.,926.959,1.335
And I have a feeling that that&amp;#39;s where the President,928.294,2.235
and the First Lady are going to be focused on on,930.529,2.136
"Sunday night, and so we&amp;#39;ll go from there.",932.665,2.102
"The Press: Sean, the President is going to have",934.767,2.435
a big audience next Tuesday in the joint,937.202,2.169
address to Congress.,939.371,0.868
Does he have a set of goals in mind,940.239,1.601
for the speech?,941.84,0.868
And do you think we&amp;#39;re going to see some specific,942.708,2.903
policy rollouts as part of that speech?,945.611,2.002
Mr. Spicer: I think that the speech is going to,947.613,2.903
focus -- I mentioned this yesterday -- I think it&amp;#39;s,950.516,2.869
going to talk -- remind the American people what,953.385,2.603
"he&amp;#39;s done already, and make sure that he explains",955.988,3.036
to them not just because of a sense of,959.024,1.702
"accomplishment in moving this country forward, but",960.726,3.303
because I think it&amp;#39;s important for the American,964.029,2.469
"people to know that he was an agent of change, he",966.498,2.736
"came here to get things done, and he didn&amp;#39;t",969.234,2.77
waste any time.,972.004,0.734
He&amp;#39;s committed to keeping his word.,972.738,4.237
And then I think he&amp;#39;s going to lay out his,976.975,1.335
vision and talk about things like education and,978.31,1.769
"healthcare and infrastructure, the",980.079,3.069
"problems that we face as a country, the violence in",983.148,2.636
"some of our inner cities, but also some of the",985.784,2.136
solutions that we can act on and some of the,987.92,1.635
partnerships that we can create.,989.555,2.769
It&amp;#39;s obviously still a work in progress.,992.324,1.535
But I think it&amp;#39;s going to look forward to where he,993.859,3.904
wants to take this country and talk about working,997.763,3.337
with Congress and other leaders throughout the,1001.1,1.501
country to get things done.,1002.601,1.668
"But I think in the drafts that I&amp;#39;ve seen so far, it",1004.269,4.672
is going to be a very strong blueprint of where,1008.941,4.204
he wants to take this country.,1013.145,2.069
"In the past, I think a lot of presidents -- or some",1015.214,1.935
"presidents, rather, have gotten into very",1017.149,1.602
detailed specifics.,1018.751,0.967
I think you&amp;#39;re going to see him try to talk about,1019.718,2.703
policies in a broad sense of where he wants to take,1022.421,2.135
"this country and what defining success is, what",1024.556,3.704
that goal means.,1028.26,2.069
"But it&amp;#39;s still a work in progress, and hopefully",1030.329,1.635
towards the end of the week -- The Press: Is the,1031.964,1.802
"tone going to be optimistic, sunny?",1033.766,1.334
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, I think this is an opportunity for",1035.1,2.536
him to lay out a very positive vision for the,1037.636,2.002
nation and to really let America know where we can,1039.638,4.404
"go and how we can get there, and the potential",1044.042,1.936
that we have as a nation. Anita.,1045.978,1.802
"The Press: Just piggybacking on that, and",1047.78,1.801
then I have another question.,1049.581,1.268
"Will he -- I know past presidents, including",1050.849,2.069
"President Obama, immediately hit the road",1052.918,1.535
"after -- I know this isn&amp;#39;t a State of the Union, but",1054.453,3.203
something like a State of the Union address,1057.656,1.335
to sell policies.,1058.991,1.001
"And since you&amp;#39;re saying it&amp;#39;s more of a vision,",1059.992,2.269
does he anticipate doing -- going out --,1062.261,2.335
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, I think there will be some travel.",1064.596,2.436
I don&amp;#39;t want to -- that&amp;#39;s evolving right now.,1067.032,2.169
There&amp;#39;s a lot of things,1069.201,1.235
that we&amp;#39;re trying to look at.,1070.436,1.534
And I think as we look at the speech and some of the,1071.97,3.637
"objectives and goals and vision that he&amp;#39;s sharing,",1075.607,3.037
talk to him about potential places to go,1078.644,2.102
to highlight that.,1080.746,0.834
But I think you&amp;#39;re going to see a fair amount of,1081.58,5.205
visits in the next few weeks to highlight some of,1086.785,3.47
the places that he wants to take them.,1090.255,1.335
"The Press: And then the other thing was, I&amp;#39;ve seen",1091.59,1.969
-- some members of Congress were,1093.559,1.534
here last week.,1095.093,0.735
There&amp;#39;s the legislative meeting today.,1095.828,2.535
It feels as if we haven&amp;#39;t seen as many executive,1098.363,3.003
actions -- or executive orders.,1101.366,1.535
I know we have the one -- vetting one coming,1102.901,2.636
out this week.,1105.537,1.001
Are we in a different phase now that he&amp;#39;s sort,1106.538,2.569
of done the executive orders that he wants to do --,1109.107,1.402
Mr. Spicer: No.,1110.509,0.667
The Press: -- and we&amp;#39;re going to legislation?,1111.176,1.335
Mr. Spicer: We have several that are,1112.511,1.335
in the pipeline.,1113.846,0.667
And part of it is just -- these days are focused,1114.513,4.671
with these meetings and getting things done and,1119.184,3.537
trying to plan ahead.,1122.721,0.834
And so as we see fit and as the implementation,1123.555,3.137
"process of a lot of these goes through the process,",1126.692,2.135
we&amp;#39;ll have future -- we&amp;#39;ll have plenty more.,1128.827,2.302
But -- The Press: It does seem that there&amp;#39;s more,1131.129,1.736
legislative emphasis right now.,1132.865,1.735
"Mr. Spicer: Well, it&amp;#39;s both.",1134.6,0.901
And I think part of this is as we work through,1135.501,1.468
"Congress, Anita, these are big things, right?",1136.969,2.602
We&amp;#39;re talking about fundamental tax reform --,1139.571,2.036
something that hasn&amp;#39;t happened in our,1141.607,1.334
nation since 1986.,1142.941,1.335
"The repeal and replacement of Obamacare,",1144.276,1.735
which was mammoth.,1146.011,2.269
And I think part of this is that those,1148.28,2.836
things take time.,1151.116,0.968
He&amp;#39;s got a joint address on Tuesday.,1152.084,1.902
"There&amp;#39;s a lot of things that are happening, and",1153.986,2.235
therefore we need to kind of make sure that we,1156.221,4.638
appropriately use the schedule.,1160.859,1.135
But I can assure you that if you&amp;#39;ve missed executive,1161.994,3.637
"orders, you&amp;#39;re going to see a bunch --",1165.631,1.334
The Press: (Inaudible.),1166.965,0.668
Mr. Spicer: (Laughter.) I know.,1167.633,0.667
I just want to make sure you know.,1168.3,1.335
Jonathan Karl.,1169.635,0.667
"The Press: I want to ask you about the town halls,",1170.302,2.002
and we&amp;#39;re hearing about Obamacare.,1172.304,2.502
The President referred to &amp;quot;so-called angry crowds&amp;quot;,1174.806,3.003
at these town halls.,1177.809,1.001
"Is he suggesting this is manufactured anger, that",1178.81,3.137
this is not real anger and real concern?,1181.947,2.336
Mr. Spicer: Thanks.,1184.283,0.834
I think there&amp;#39;s a hybrid there.,1185.117,1.735
I think some people are clearly upset.,1186.852,2.002
"But there is a bit of professional protestor,",1188.854,2.903
manufactured base in there.,1191.757,2.002
But obviously there are people that are upset.,1193.759,2.469
But I also think that when you look at some of these,1196.228,3.637
"districts and some of these things, that it is",1199.865,1.735
not a representation of a member&amp;#39;s district or -- it,1201.6,1.335
"is a loud group, small group of people disrupting",1202.935,1.334
"something, in many cases, for media attention.",1204.269,1.335
No offense.,1205.604,0.667
It&amp;#39;s just -- I think that necessarily -- just,1206.271,1.335
because they&amp;#39;re loud doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean,1207.606,6.073
that there are many.,1213.679,5.939
And I think in a lot of cases that&amp;#39;s,1219.618,2.169
what you&amp;#39;re seeing.,1221.787,0.7
The Press: Does the President doubt that,1222.487,1.335
there is real anger --,1223.822,1.268
"Mr. Spicer: No, I just said that.",1225.09,1.335
The Press: -- and real concern out there beyond,1226.425,1.668
"just a few loud agitators, that there&amp;#39;s real concern",1228.093,1.368
that people may lose their healthcare?,1229.461,2.236
"Mr. Spicer: But see, I think that that&amp;#39;s",1231.697,1.534
a false narrative.,1233.231,1.202
And I don&amp;#39;t -- the President has,1234.433,1.902
been very clear.,1236.335,0.8
"Look, you have to look at what our healthcare",1237.135,2.136
system is right now.,1239.271,0.934
"In so many counties around our nation, we&amp;#39;ve gone",1240.205,3.17
down to one provider.,1243.375,2.703
That&amp;#39;s not choice.,1246.078,1.001
That&amp;#39;s not access.,1247.079,1.668
And then they&amp;#39;re going in a lot of cases and they&amp;#39;re,1248.747,1.468
"saying, we&amp;#39;re not taking Medicaid, we&amp;#39;re not taking",1250.215,1.568
"TRICARE, we&amp;#39;re not taking the insurance you used to",1251.783,2.236
have; the doctor that you used to have isn&amp;#39;t,1254.019,1.335
participating anymore.,1255.354,0.967
"And, oh, by the way, states like Arizona,",1256.321,2.536
you&amp;#39;ve got over 100 percent increase in,1258.857,1.568
premiums -- 112 [percent] I think was,1260.425,1.969
the number there.,1262.394,0.701
"In many states, it&amp;#39;s double, triple --",1263.095,1.334
double-digit.,1264.429,1.035
And I think that the idea that we have to remember,1265.464,4.437
is that the American people got sold the,1269.901,2.77
Affordable Care Act -- it&amp;#39;s neither,1272.671,1.902
affordable or accessible.,1274.573,1.768
They&amp;#39;re losing their coverage and premiums,1276.341,2.069
are spiking.,1278.41,1.134
And so if people are truly worried about losing their,1279.544,1.869
"coverage, they should be applauding the President&amp;#39;s",1281.413,2.269
action for wanting to make sure that we put a system,1283.682,2.336
in place that does what they were supposed to have,1286.018,2.636
been promised a while back.,1288.654,2.002
And I think that&amp;#39;s -- that&amp;#39;s what I think is,1290.656,1.368
missing from this dialogue.,1292.024,1.768
I&amp;#39;ve seen some folks that were protesting in some of,1293.792,2.369
"these things saying, I lost -- I&amp;#39;m on Obamacare,",1296.161,2.703
I&amp;#39;m going to lose my thing.,1298.864,1.168
"And when they were asked how old they were, they",1300.032,1.701
"were, oh, I&amp;#39;m 71, 72.",1301.733,1.235
"Well, they&amp;#39;re not on Obamacare.",1302.968,1.368
-- they&amp;#39;re on Medicaid.,1304.336,0.667
The Press: So you think you&amp;#39;re making it up?,1305.003,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: No, not they&amp;#39;re making it up.",1306.338,1.401
But what I&amp;#39;m getting at it is I think that there is a,1307.739,1.702
lot of blurring of the facts.,1309.441,2.269
And the reality is that some people,1311.71,1.401
aren&amp;#39;t on Obamacare.,1313.111,0.935
They&amp;#39;re on an employer-based system.,1314.046,1.568
They&amp;#39;re on Medicaid.,1315.614,1.134
They&amp;#39;re receiving their benefits through Medicare,1316.748,2.303
because of their age.,1319.051,2.135
And so they&amp;#39;re in -- nothing.,1321.186,1.468
They have no problems.,1322.654,1.668
"But I think in other cases, people are now",1324.322,1.769
being told that the plan that they&amp;#39;re on is,1326.091,1.702
unsustainable; that these carriers throughout the,1327.793,2.702
"country -- I mean, you just look at them, over",1330.495,1.869
and over again pulling out of the exchanges.,1332.364,2.636
"The reality is, is that they are losing their",1335,1.735
"healthcare, but they&amp;#39;re losing it under Obamacare",1336.735,2.836
because the exchanges are collapsing on themselves.,1339.571,2.169
Carriers are pulling out.,1341.74,0.934
Premiums are going up.,1342.674,1.001
And access is going down.,1343.675,0.667
So the President&amp;#39;s plan is actually going to do,1344.342,5.406
exactly what they were promised eight years ago,1349.748,2.035
and didn&amp;#39;t get.,1351.783,0.935
"So for those who are worried, the answer is:",1352.718,2.335
Help is on the way.,1355.053,0.968
The Press: But what is the plan?,1356.021,1.334
We haven&amp;#39;t seen what he&amp;#39;s going to replace it with.,1357.355,1.969
"Mr. Spicer: First, as the President made clear,",1359.324,1.602
we&amp;#39;re going to have that out in the,1360.926,1.368
next couple weeks.,1362.294,0.667
He&amp;#39;s working on it.,1362.961,1.201
"But the goal, Jonathan, is this got jammed through a",1364.162,2.202
"Democratic Congress, and then they told us you",1366.364,2.403
could read it after we get it passed.,1368.767,2.402
"So taking our time, getting this right to",1371.169,2.102
achieve the goals that we set forth is probably the,1373.271,2.203
"right thing to do, considering the experience",1375.474,1.635
that we had the last time.,1377.109,0.834
Hallie.,1377.943,0.667
"The Press: Sean, two questions for you.",1378.61,1.635
The issue of transgender bathrooms wasn&amp;#39;t one we,1380.245,2.169
heard a lot about from the President,1382.414,1.401
during the campaign.,1383.815,0.768
"He said at one point, Caitlyn Jenner could use",1384.583,2.269
whichever bathroom she wanted to at Trump Tower.,1386.852,2.102
So why is this now a priority for the,1388.954,2.235
administration 40 days into office?,1391.189,1.368
Mr. Spicer: It&amp;#39;s not a priority.,1392.557,1.335
I think there&amp;#39;s a case -- The Press: But It&amp;#39;s one,1393.892,1.735
of the first things --,1395.627,0.767
Mr. Spicer: But let me answer the question.,1396.394,2.336
It&amp;#39;s not a priority.,1398.73,0.667
There is a case pending in the Supreme Court in which,1399.397,1.402
we have to decide whether or not to continue to,1400.799,2.336
issue guidance to the Court.,1403.135,1.101
It&amp;#39;s dictated by that.,1404.236,3.904
The Obama administration had issued joint guidance,1408.14,2.102
from the Department of Education and the,1410.242,2.035
Department of Justice.,1412.277,0.667
We now have to decide whether or not this,1412.944,1.802
administration wants to continue that track that,1414.746,2.069
they were on.,1416.815,1.034
It&amp;#39;s plain and simple.,1417.849,0.768
"If we don&amp;#39;t -- but there are problems, both in the",1418.617,3.703
"legal and process way, in",1422.32,1.235
which that guidance was issued.,1423.555,2.302
And so it&amp;#39;s incumbent upon us to actually follow the,1425.857,2.002
law and to recognize that Title IX never,1427.859,2.937
talked about this.,1430.796,0.667
It was enacted in 1972.,1431.463,1.568
There was no discussion of this back then.,1433.031,1.635
And to assume certain elements of the law were,1434.666,3.17
thought of back then with respect to this would be,1437.836,2.703
completely preposterous.,1440.539,1.434
"The Press: And to be clear, Secretary DeVos is",1441.973,1.569
onboard with this?,1443.542,1.234
"Mr. Spicer: Yes, 100 percent.",1444.776,1.668
Thank you.,1446.444,0.668
"The Press: Sean, that was actually a clarification.",1447.112,2.035
The second question is on Mexico.,1449.147,1.635
The Secretary of State&amp;#39;s trip that is tonight along,1450.782,2.469
"with Secretary Kelly, obviously there have been",1453.251,1.902
"tensions, right, between the Mexican President and",1455.153,1.902
President Trump.,1457.055,0.701
Is this a clean-up job for the Secretary of State?,1457.756,2.602
Mr. Spicer: No.,1460.358,0.801
I think that President Peña Nieto and President,1461.159,2.736
"Trump spoke -- again, the foreign ministers had",1463.895,3.537
several contacts with our staff.,1467.432,1.468
I would argue that we have a very healthy and robust,1468.9,4.071
relationship with the Mexican government and,1472.971,2.102
"Mexican officials, and I think they would echo",1475.073,1.335
that same sentiment.,1476.408,1.067
President Peña Nieto has echoed that as well.,1477.475,2.236
But I think the relationship with Mexico,1479.711,2.703
"is phenomenal right now, and I think there&amp;#39;s an",1482.414,1.568
unbelievable and robust dialogue between,1483.982,2.302
our two nations.,1486.284,0.668
"Margaret, and then I&amp;#39;ll get you.",1486.952,1.835
"The Press: On Syria, General Votel indicated",1488.787,2.302
today that the U.S.,1491.089,1.335
needs to take a larger share of the burden and,1492.424,3.303
perhaps send troops to Syria.,1495.727,1.668
Has the President discussed this with his,1497.395,2.303
national security team?,1499.698,1.001
And when does he -- Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m going to,1500.699,3.436
refer you back to DOD on that.,1504.135,1.268
I would just argue that I think that you&amp;#39;ve seen the,1505.403,2.47
President talk about safe harbors in Syria with,1507.873,1.501
several foreign leaders who have shared his --,1509.374,1.502
The Press: Safe havens.,1510.876,0.767
"Mr. Spicer: Safe havens, thank you.",1511.643,1.668
And that is an area at the top of the President&amp;#39;s,1513.311,4.905
foreign policy agenda that he has continued to talk,1518.216,2.136
"to leaders, especially in the Middle east, about,",1520.352,3.436
trying to make sure that we deal with that issue in,1523.788,2.203
that area right now.,1525.991,2.636
But I&amp;#39;m not going to get ahead of the DOD on this.,1528.627,2.869
"And then when they have recommendations, they&amp;#39;ll",1531.496,1.335
make them forward to us.,1532.831,0.834
The Press: Is there an NSC -- has the President,1533.665,2.502
"spoken to -- Mr. Spicer: Look, I will -- if I have",1536.167,2.67
"an update, I&amp;#39;ll give it to you tomorrow.",1538.837,1.334
Go ahead.,1540.171,0.668
The Press: President Trump and the Canadian,1540.839,1.334
Minister wants the U.S.,1542.173,1.001
and Canada Council for,1543.174,1.202
Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs.,1544.376,1.735
Can you talk a little bit about how the council is,1546.111,2.169
growing and transpiring?,1548.28,1.167
What&amp;#39;s the status of it?,1549.447,1.168
Mr. Spicer: I think staff is beginning to implement,1550.615,2.102
the President&amp;#39;s agenda.,1552.717,0.935
"It occurred, what, six, seven days ago.",1553.652,2.302
And so it&amp;#39;s starting to work through the process,1555.954,2.102
and we&amp;#39;ll have further updates as,1558.056,1.902
it goes forward.,1559.958,0.667
But I know that he continues to be in touch,1560.625,1.902
"with Prime Minister Trudeau, and our staff",1562.527,3.237
continues to work on the,1565.764,2.435
back end to make this happen.,1568.199,3.07
Zeke.,1571.269,0.668
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1571.937,1.901
I have two questions for you.,1573.838,3.07
"One, earlier in your conversation with Jon,",1576.908,3.604
does the White House not have confidence in its,1580.512,4.604
Cabinet Secretaries if it&amp;#39;s looking sort of over,1585.116,4.104
their shoulders?,1589.22,1.035
Does the White House not -- does the President not,1590.255,4.638
"trust his Cabinet Secretaries, appointees",1594.893,2.002
and agency administrators to staff -- to find people,1596.895,1.368
who agree with the President&amp;#39;s agenda?,1598.263,1.334
"Mr. Spicer: No, not at all.",1599.597,0.668
I think there&amp;#39;s a big difference.,1600.265,1.334
The President named these folks because they&amp;#39;re,1601.599,1.335
unbelievably qualified individuals.,1602.934,1.335
"Part of it, though, is that you&amp;#39;re staffing major",1604.269,1.334
departments and I think we&amp;#39;ve got somewhere in the,1605.603,1.369
"area of 5,000 positions to fill.",1606.972,1.334
And when you&amp;#39;re filtering through a good number of,1608.306,1.335
"people, I don&amp;#39;t even think the Secretaries, at some",1609.641,2.102
"degree, depending on the department, have a full",1611.743,3.237
background on some of these individuals.,1614.98,1.334
"And so as they get pumped through the pipeline,",1616.314,2.236
there are questions.,1618.55,0.667
"And, again, there are areas that are of key",1619.217,4.938
priority to the President that he campaigned on.,1624.155,2.369
And I think that when he wants to make sure that,1626.524,1.735
certain of those individuals who are going,1628.259,1.902
to be overseeing key priorities that he,1630.161,2.269
promised the American people have somebody who,1632.43,3.971
is not only qualified but agrees with and shares the,1636.401,3.17
President&amp;#39;s vision to fix whatever problem that was,1639.571,2.769
or fulfill whatever vision that he articulated.,1642.34,2.503
"But I think that that -- I mean, it would almost be",1644.843,2.435
malpractice not to do that.,1647.278,2.069
"To allow people to fill a job, a political appointee",1649.347,3.237
"job, who don&amp;#39;t share the vision and agenda of the",1652.584,3.069
President of the United States would almost be --,1655.653,2.203
"I mean, it would be silly on its face",1657.856,2.269
to suggest this.,1660.125,0.867
I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s any administration in past,1660.992,2.036
"history that would literally, willingly, take",1663.028,3.103
on somebody who was adamantly opposed or spoke,1666.131,2.802
out specifically against what the President was,1668.933,2.903
"seeking to do, and then have them fulfill a job to",1671.836,2.67
carry out that mission.,1674.506,0.934
It just -- it doesn&amp;#39;t seem,1675.44,1.068
as though it makes any sense. Yes.,1676.508,3.036
The Press: Second thing real quick.,1679.544,2.636
We&amp;#39;re coming up on a week away from the deadline the,1682.18,2.169
President ordered for his review of the,1684.349,1.868
counter-ISIS strategy.,1686.217,0.668
What&amp;#39;s the status of that review?,1686.885,1.434
The President tweeted over the weekend that he was,1688.319,2.403
meeting with a bunch of generals.,1690.722,1.568
Mr. Spicer: Yes.,1692.29,0.801
The Press: Is that regarding that review?,1693.091,1.868
Mr. Spicer: I think General Dunford and,1694.959,1.836
Secretary Mattis have begun providing him,1696.795,2.569
updates on that.,1699.364,1.168
I know that the new National Security Advisor,1700.532,2.869
is getting brought into that process and,1703.401,2.236
"continuing to do updates, so we&amp;#39;ll have",1705.637,2.035
further updates.,1707.672,0.667
But the team has been working on it since the,1708.339,1.435
President issued the guidance. Yes.,1709.774,1.335
The Press: As far as the second executive order is,1711.109,3.003
"concerned, what is the White House doing",1714.112,3.136
differently in terms of consulting with various,1717.248,3.137
departments to make certain that this second,1720.385,3.136
executive order passes constitutional scrutiny?,1723.521,2.236
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think we&amp;#39;ve done a few things.",1725.757,2.636
"One is, I think we&amp;#39;ve been very clear about",1728.393,2.402
understanding what the court said in trying to,1730.795,2.703
tailor that specifically while achieving the same,1733.498,1.935
goals of keeping America safe and ensuring that,1735.433,3.637
people don&amp;#39;t come into this country that,1739.07,1.869
seek to do us harm.,1740.939,1.134
That&amp;#39;s number one.,1742.073,0.667
"Number two is, we continue -- and that order is",1742.74,3.938
basically completed.,1746.678,1.835
I think what we&amp;#39;re now doing is working with the,1748.513,1.568
various agencies and departments to make sure,1750.081,2.136
that the implementation of that is done in an,1752.217,2.969
extremely smooth way.,1755.186,1.468
So we have looked at it from both a process,1756.654,2.97
"standpoint, as well as a legal standpoint.",1759.624,3.704
And I think it&amp;#39;s achieving the goals.,1763.328,2.202
"But again, I would also mention that, on the",1765.53,2.369
"merits, I believe that the first order did just that.",1767.899,3.303
It was written in a way -- and I think ultimately we,1771.202,4.538
will continue to prevail on that -- because it is,1775.74,3.537
written in a way that is,1779.277,1.501
clear and consistent with U.S.,1780.778,1.702
code and the authority that the President has to,1782.48,2.936
protect the nation. Katie.,1785.416,0.468
The Press: Sean --,1785.884,1.434
The Press: No matter what,1787.318,0.901
"happens, as it relates to the second executive",1788.219,1.302
"order, it&amp;#39;s almost likely to face a legal challenge.",1789.521,2.836
Mr. Spicer: Sure.,1792.357,0.934
The Press: Are you concerned that the,1793.291,0.868
President&amp;#39;s prior remarks as it relates to the,1794.159,2.836
judiciary is going to allow him to get a fair,1796.995,4.404
hearing by the judicial branch as it relates to,1801.399,2.703
the second executive order?,1804.102,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, absolutely.",1804.769,0.667
I think that --,1805.436,0.668
The Press: Why do you say that?,1806.104,0.834
Mr. Spicer: Because I think that you&amp;#39;ve seen it,1806.938,2.236
happen in the Massachusetts case.,1809.174,1.334
"I mean, at the end of the day, you look at the law",1810.508,2.803
and what the order does.,1813.311,1.335
"And I think, again, you may have -- in the case of",1814.646,3.036
"the 9th Circuit, we",1817.682,1.702
continue to disagree with that.,1819.384,1.234
I think the President has pointed out you don&amp;#39;t have,1820.618,1.335
to be that high up in grade school to recognize,1821.953,1.335
"what the code says, what the authority that is",1823.288,1.334
"granted to him, and then what the order does.",1824.622,1.368
I think the things that they brought out in that,1825.99,6.84
"order -- in one of the cases, they suggested",1832.83,5.272
there have been no people that have entered within,1838.102,1.502
the seven countries.,1839.604,1.068
And a quick cursory look found upwards of close to,1840.672,2.602
20 people that had come in.,1843.274,1.535
So some of the basis for which they decided the,1844.809,2.87
case on doesn&amp;#39;t actually pass muster.,1847.679,2.335
And I think any other judge or judges that look,1850.014,2.903
at that order or the one that will be put forward,1852.917,2.569
will come to the same conclusion. Katie.,1855.486,1.335
"The Press: Sean, I wanted to ask about the",1856.821,1.335
President&amp;#39;s budget priorities.,1858.156,1.701
What specifically is the President increasing,1859.857,1.936
spending on?,1861.793,0.667
Where is he decreasing spending?,1862.46,1.502
And how much money specifically is he asking,1863.962,2.502
"for the 5,000 new Border Patrol agents",1866.464,2.169
he&amp;#39;s asked for?,1868.633,0.901
Mr. Spicer: So I&amp;#39;m going to refer you back to,1869.534,2.035
"Margaret&amp;#39;s question, and then we&amp;#39;ll have something",1871.569,2.503
in mid-March as we put that out.,1874.072,1.801
But I&amp;#39;m not going to get ahead of,1875.873,1.569
Director Mulvaney.,1877.442,0.801
The Press: (Inaudible.),1878.243,1.001
"Mr. Spicer: No, I mean,",1879.244,0.934
"it&amp;#39;s not -- look, he just had a meeting where he&amp;#39;s",1880.178,1.668
continued to work that out.,1881.846,0.734
They&amp;#39;re providing him back-and-forth.,1882.58,1.335
That&amp;#39;s the idea of crafting this budget.,1883.915,1.335
"And until we put it out on paper, I don&amp;#39;t want to get",1885.25,3.403
"ahead of -- The Press: Sean, can I follow",1888.653,2.269
up on Mexico?,1890.922,0.767
Mr. Spicer: Yes.,1891.689,0.734
The Press: Thank you very much.,1892.423,1.535
Back to Mexico -- Videgaray and many,1893.958,1.769
officials have said this morning that they&amp;#39;re not,1895.727,2.002
going to accept the directives that were put,1897.729,2.035
"out by the White House and by DHS yesterday, and they",1899.764,2.736
may not take anyone that&amp;#39;s not a Mexican immigrant.,1902.5,2.836
What are you guys doing to do with those people that,1905.336,1.936
Mexico will not accept?,1907.272,0.8
Mr. Spicer: I think Secretary Tillerson and,1908.072,1.402
Secretary Kelly are going to have a great discussion,1909.474,1.568
"down there, and to walk through the implementation",1911.042,2.903
of the executive order.,1913.945,1.735
But I feel very confident that any country who has a,1915.68,4.037
"citizen that comes into this country, and that we",1919.717,1.468
"send back, we&amp;#39;ll make sure",1921.185,1.202
that they comply with this.,1922.387,0.967
David.,1923.354,1.135
The Press: Two questions about immigration.,1924.489,2.302
"One, the President has talked a number of times",1926.791,2.169
about millions of illegal immigrants casting votes,1928.96,3.67
"during the election, in his mind.",1932.63,1.435
You guys have promised to look into that.,1934.065,1.068
It seems like there was no mention of that in any of,1935.133,2.102
"these directives, to look for these immigrants.",1937.235,1.835
Does the President still believe this is a national,1939.07,2.035
security problem?,1941.105,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, and Vice President Pence will lead",1941.773,1.601
a task force on this.,1943.374,0.968
"The Press: Where would we stand on that, though?",1944.342,1.068
"Mr. Spicer: He named a task force, and the Vice",1945.41,2.669
President is starting to gather names and,1948.079,1.835
individuals to be part of it.,1949.914,1.101
The Press: On the other question I had about the,1951.015,2.536
"DACA program, yesterday you suggested, well, we",1953.551,3.437
have to go after hardened criminals and major,1956.988,2.436
national security threats first.,1959.424,1.968
"But during the campaign, the President talked about",1961.392,3.904
DACA as being an unconstitutional,1965.296,1.435
executive amnesty.,1966.731,0.701
Does he still think it was an unconstitutional use of,1967.432,3.47
President Obama&amp;#39;s powers?,1970.902,1.101
"And if so, does he plan --",1972.003,1.201
Mr. Spicer: I think --,1973.204,1.168
"yeah, I think -- and I said this yesterday: The",1974.372,1.335
President is very clear about his priorities with,1975.707,1.668
respect to immigration.,1977.375,1.201
Yesterday was focused on going after people who are,1978.576,3.37
a concern -- a public safety concern.,1981.946,1.969
And we&amp;#39;re going to walk through this very --,1983.915,2.235
The Press: -- unconstitutional?,1986.15,0.668
Mr. Spicer: We will get back to you on that.,1986.818,1.535
Right now the focus is on keeping the country safe,1988.353,3.203
and making sure that we walk through. Shane.,1991.556,1.334
"The Press: I want to ask on immigration, as well.",1992.89,2.236
Given all of the push on deporting illegal,1995.126,2.302
"immigrants, I wanted to see if this White House",1997.428,2.836
and President Trump have any interest in curtailing,2000.264,2.503
legal immigration going forward.,2002.767,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: Again, we got to look at this from a",2004.102,2.235
priority level.,2006.337,0.934
Right now there&amp;#39;s millions of people in this country,2007.271,3.471
that are in the country illegally.,2010.742,1.334
I think the focus continues to be that,2012.076,2.336
"800,000 or 900,000 that have already had an order",2014.412,2.636
to have them removed and get them processed through,2017.048,2.669
in a way that continues to keep America safe.,2019.717,2.87
"Legal immigration, obviously, is a completely",2022.587,1.968
"separate subject, and that includes visa reform and",2024.555,3.537
all that other stuff.,2028.092,0.668
The President has talked about that.,2028.76,1.835
He&amp;#39;s talked about it with business leaders -- H-1B,2030.595,1.668
"visas, et cetera.",2032.263,1.668
You&amp;#39;re going to see more of that coming.,2033.931,1.335
But I think there is a prioritization of how we,2035.266,2.703
deal with immigration -- both illegal,2037.969,2.169
and then legal.,2040.138,0.667
And we&amp;#39;ll have more on that later.,2040.805,1.368
I got to run.,2042.173,0.667
"Thank you, guys, very much.",2042.84,1.602
We&amp;#39;ll see you tomorrow.,2044.442,4.972
Take care.,2052.784,4.204
