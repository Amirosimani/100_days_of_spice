Mr. Spicer: I was thinking about not doing a briefing,14.981,1.568
"today, and then I saw Reince Priebus and Steve",16.549,2.469
Bannon give that talk and I thought they were,19.018,1.435
"infringing on my ratings, so we figured we had to do",20.453,3.137
something to keep up our record.,23.59,2.569
It&amp;#39;s been another busy day today.,26.159,2.402
"This morning, after receiving his daily",28.561,1.569
"intelligence briefing, the President welcomed some of",30.13,2.068
the world&amp;#39;s top business and manufacturing leaders,32.198,2.469
to the White House to continue the,34.667,1.936
administration&amp;#39;s effort to engage with the private,36.603,1.935
sector to create jobs and expand opportunities for,38.538,3.337
America&amp;#39;s workers.,41.875,1.635
The 24 CEOs spent the morning in working,43.51,2.636
"sessions with the Vice President, Cabinet members",46.146,1.968
"and key aides, and came together with the",48.114,1.902
President to brief him on their discussions,50.016,1.668
and recommendations.,51.684,1.435
The group discussed the need to roll back,53.119,2.236
burdensome regulations that are stifling,55.355,1.535
economic growth.,56.89,1.368
The CEOs thanked the President for the actions,58.258,1.635
"that he&amp;#39;s already taken to address the issues, and",59.893,3.37
"the President pledged to do even more, both through",63.263,3.003
the executive branch and by working with Congress,66.266,3.17
to pass legislation that will help further economic,69.436,3.403
growth and job creation.,72.839,1.668
The business leaders recommended that the,74.507,1.168
administration take a multifaceted approach to,75.675,2.669
"tax and trade policies, including tax reform,",78.344,3.037
toward which Secretary Mnuchin said that progress,81.381,2.502
is continuing to be made.,83.883,1.569
The President committed to working to lower taxes and,85.452,2.469
level the playing field with other countries when,87.921,2.302
it comes to trade and taxation.,90.223,2.636
The group held a lengthy discussion about the need,92.859,1.768
to invest in the American worker to prepare for the,94.627,2.469
"manufacturing jobs of the future, especially the key",97.096,2.67
role of vocational schools in training the workforce,99.766,3.07
of the 21st century.,102.836,2.769
The CEOs and administration officials,105.605,2.302
agreed that public-private partnerships will be the,107.907,2.536
cornerstone of a robust plan to rebuild the,110.443,2.836
nation&amp;#39;s crumbling infrastructure.,113.279,2.636
The President committed to streamlining a permitting,115.915,2.803
process that is holding back so many key projects.,118.718,3.904
"At the end of the discussion, the group",122.622,2.069
expressed their excitement for having a true partner,124.691,1.935
"in economic growth in the White House, and Andrew",126.626,2.803
"Liveris, the CEO of Dow Chemical, even said that",129.429,2.636
this is probably the most pro-business,132.065,1.701
administration since the Founding Fathers.,133.766,3.337
The President conveyed his intention to assemble the,137.103,1.802
industry leaders on a regular basis to discuss,138.905,2.436
progress towards these important goals.,141.341,2.435
A full list of the participants is available.,143.776,2.87
"This afternoon, the President spoke with",146.646,1.602
Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau by phone.,148.248,2.302
We&amp;#39;ll have a readout on that call soon.,150.55,2.469
"Right now, many of you just came from the",153.019,1.635
"President, who is involved in another listening",154.654,1.902
session with leaders in the fight against domestic,156.556,2.936
"and international human trafficking, including",159.492,2.269
representatives from International Justice,161.761,2.269
Mission and United Way.,164.03,2.236
Their expertise will be invaluable to the,166.266,3.37
President as he engages with members of Congress,169.636,2.769
"to raise awareness about, and push through,",172.405,2.236
legislation aimed at preventing all forms of,174.641,2.869
the horrific and unacceptable practice of,177.51,2.336
the buying and selling of human lives.,179.846,2.502
"Human trafficking is a dire problem, both",182.348,1.936
domestically and internationally.,184.284,2.535
And solving this epidemic is a huge priority,186.819,2.036
for the President.,188.855,1.234
Dedicated men and women from across the federal,190.089,2.002
"government have focused on this for some time, and",192.091,2.503
the President is committed to continue working with,194.594,2.469
these organizations and departments.,197.063,2.569
A participant list for this listening session is,199.632,2.236
also going to be available.,201.868,1.668
The President this evening will attend a dinner with,203.536,1.702
the Business Council.,205.238,1.501
"Today in Mexico, Secretaries Tillerson and",206.739,2.002
Kelly had productive meetings at the Cabinet,208.741,2.67
level with officials from the Mexican government.,211.411,2.369
They were forward-looking meetings focused on,213.78,1.802
finding common-ground ways to advance both of our,215.582,3.603
countries&amp;#39; security and economic wellbeing.,219.185,2.002
Both sides had a candid discussion on the breadth,221.187,2.236
of challenges and opportunities as part of,223.423,2.969
the U.S.-Mexico relationship.,226.392,1.936
The conversation covered a full range of bilateral,228.328,2.102
"issues, including energy, legal migration, security,",230.43,3.37
"education exchanges, and people-to-people ties.",233.8,3.67
The parties also reiterated our joint,237.47,2.136
commitment to maintaining law and order at our,239.606,2.902
shared border by stopping potential terrorists and,242.508,2.103
dismantling the transnational criminal,244.611,1.768
networks that are moving drugs and people into the,246.379,2.035
United States.,248.414,1.602
Under this President there is no mistaking that rule,250.016,1.935
of law matters along both sides of our border.,251.951,3.37
Both Secretary Tillerson and Secretary Kelly are,255.321,2.903
meeting with President Pe√±a Nieto this afternoon.,258.224,2.936
That will be a continuation of the,261.16,2.47
productive dialogue that is setting our two,263.63,1.868
countries down a pathway to greater security and,265.498,2.402
long-term prosperity.,267.9,1.635
"Looking ahead to our upcoming schedule,",269.535,2.369
tomorrow the President will welcome President of,271.904,1.869
Peru for a working-level visit.,273.773,1.668
The President of Peru is in town for a separate,275.441,1.902
visit and requested a meeting with,277.343,1.335
the President.,278.678,1.034
There will be a spray at the top of that.,279.712,1.635
Further guidance will be provided later today.,281.347,2.803
The President will also speak at CPAC tomorrow.,284.15,2.436
I know the President is looking forward to,286.586,2.002
addressing this group of,288.588,1.168
conservative-committed individuals.,289.756,3.67
Our nation&amp;#39;s governors are starting to gather in,293.426,1.935
Washington this week for a meeting of the National,295.361,1.735
Governors Association.,297.096,1.302
The President and the First Lady will welcome,298.398,2.168
the governors to the White House on Sunday evening.,300.566,1.836
The Vice President and members of the Cabinet,302.402,2.235
will also be in attendance.,304.637,1.201
"While the governors are in town, they will be meeting",305.838,2.002
"with members of the Cabinet, White House",307.84,1.302
"staff, and other Secretaries including",309.142,2.202
"Kelly, Price, and Secretary Chao have also",311.344,2.102
set up a series of meetings.,313.446,2.035
"The President, Vice President, and senior",315.481,1.435
White House staff will also participate in a,316.916,1.668
portion of the business session of NGA&amp;#39;s winter,318.584,2.97
meeting that takes place on Monday morning.,321.554,2.87
"Next week, of course, the President will give a",324.424,1.501
joint session address before both,325.925,1.835
Houses of Congress.,327.76,2.169
He&amp;#39;s currently working closely with the,329.929,1.401
speechwriting team on presenting his vision to,331.33,1.836
Congress and the American people.,333.166,1.735
I&amp;#39;ve got a few updates that I want to just -- as,334.901,1.835
we&amp;#39;re now a few days out.,336.736,2.035
The theme of the address will be the renewal of the,338.771,2.736
American spirit.,341.507,1.402
The address will particularly focus on,342.909,1.401
"public safety, including defense, increased border",344.31,3.07
"security, taking care of our veterans, and then",347.38,2.903
"economic opportunity, including education, job",350.283,2.536
"training, healthcare reform, jobs, and tax and",352.819,2.702
regulatory reform.,355.521,1.535
"With that, I&amp;#39;d be glad to take a few",357.056,1.602
of your questions.,358.658,1.301
The Press: Two questions.,359.959,2.736
"First, the White House said previously that that",362.695,2.202
travel ban was pushed quickly out of necessity,364.897,3.504
"for national security, and now we&amp;#39;re hearing there&amp;#39;s",368.401,2.602
these repeated delays while the new one,371.003,3.204
is being drafted.,374.207,2.168
How do we reconcile those two talking points?,376.375,1.469
That&amp;#39;s question one.,377.844,1.668
"And then secondly, the President said today that",379.512,2.202
the deportations taking place under his watch are,381.714,2.703
a military operation.,384.417,1.535
Secretary Kelly said the military won&amp;#39;t be involved,385.952,2.169
in deportations.,388.121,1.034
Did the President misspeak?,389.155,1.468
Mr. Spicer: So I&amp;#39;ll take the latter first.,390.623,2.269
The President was using that as an adjective.,392.892,1.902
"It&amp;#39;s happening with precision, and in a manner",394.794,2.869
"in which it&amp;#39;s being done very, very clearly.",397.663,2.336
"I think we&amp;#39;ve made it clear in the past, and",399.999,1.568
"Secretary Kelly reiterated it, what kind of",401.567,2.269
operation this was.,403.836,0.901
But the President was clearly describing the,404.737,2.236
manner in which this was being done.,406.973,2.736
And so just to be clear on his use of that phrase.,409.709,3.637
"And I think the way it&amp;#39;s being done, by all",413.346,1.701
"accounts, is being done with very much a high",415.047,3.604
degree of precision and a flawless manner in terms,418.651,3.537
"of making sure that the orders are carried out,",422.188,2.102
and it&amp;#39;s done in a very streamlined and,424.29,1.568
efficient manner.,425.858,0.935
"I&amp;#39;m sorry, the first part was?",426.793,1.234
The Press: The first one was about the travel ban.,428.027,1.168
Mr. Spicer: Yeah.,429.195,0.867
"And I think, look, we have made it very clear that we",430.062,2.603
believe that the first one was done in,432.665,1.602
compliance with U.S.,434.267,1.935
code and the authority granted to the President.,436.202,2.269
"This time, the order is finalized.",438.471,2.102
What we are doing is now in the implementation,440.573,1.768
phase of working with the respective departments and,442.341,2.269
"agencies to make sure that when we execute this, it&amp;#39;s",444.61,3.304
done in a manner that&amp;#39;s flawless.,447.914,2.802
"And so it&amp;#39;s not a question of delaying, it&amp;#39;s a",450.716,2.203
question of getting it right.,452.919,1.801
We&amp;#39;ve taken the Court&amp;#39;s opinions and concerns into,454.72,3.137
"consideration, but the order is finalized.",457.857,3.003
It&amp;#39;s now awaiting implementation.,460.86,1.969
What we want to do is make sure that we&amp;#39;re working,462.829,1.434
through the departments and agencies so that any,464.263,3.437
concerns or questions are handled on the front end.,467.7,2.836
But we are acting with appropriate haste and,470.536,2.903
diligence to make sure that the order is done in,473.439,2.136
an appropriate manner.,475.575,1.568
The Press: I want to ask you about a comment that,477.143,2.235
the Treasury Secretary made today.,479.378,2.503
He was asked if we should assume that the tax plan,481.881,3.37
that the President is about to roll out will,485.251,2.769
take effect in 2018.,488.02,2.303
"He said, and I&amp;#39;m quoting, &amp;quot;I think we&amp;#39;re",490.323,1.935
looking at that.&amp;quot;,492.258,1.335
"So my question to you is, would the President accept",493.593,2.669
a tax proposal that deals with the timeline of,496.262,2.069
implementation in 2018 but not 2017?,498.331,5.238
"Mr. Spicer: So, Secretary Mnuchin also made it very",503.569,2.369
clear that his goal is to have this wrapped up by,505.938,1.902
August and implemented.,507.84,1.001
"The question is, or what you&amp;#39;re referring to is",508.841,3.47
what year it actually takes place?,512.311,1.602
The Press: Right.,513.913,0.968
"Mr. Spicer: Right, so whether it&amp;#39;s retroactive",514.881,1.167
to tax year 2017 or fiscal year &amp;#39;17.,516.048,4.104
And I think as the details get --,520.152,1.035
The Press: (Inaudible.),521.187,0.467
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, we&amp;#39;ll have more",521.654,1.068
details on that as it moves forward.,522.722,1.301
I think there&amp;#39;s two issues -- fiscal year &amp;#39;17 and,524.023,1.735
calendar year &amp;#39;17.,525.758,2.136
"And, for taxpayers, it&amp;#39;s obviously calendar year",527.894,5.138
"2017 that they&amp;#39;re probably most concerned with, and I",533.032,2.603
"think the President, as we work with Congress, will",535.635,2.502
have those details to be able to flush out.,538.137,2.069
I want to go to our first Skype seat of the day.,540.206,2.302
Neil Vigdor with Hearst Connecticut Media Group.,542.508,3.003
"The Press: Good afternoon, Sean.",545.511,1.034
Thanks for taking my question.,546.545,1.435
I appreciate it.,547.98,1.268
Connecticut&amp;#39;s governor directed police chiefs,549.248,2.269
across the state Wednesday to avoid taking any,551.517,2.77
"special action against undocumented immigrants,",554.287,3.336
including honoring immigration detainer,557.623,2.87
requests from ICE.,560.493,3.303
What will the repercussions be for this,563.796,1.335
state in terms of federal funding it receives from,565.131,2.736
the Trump administration?,567.867,2.469
"And secondly, does the President&amp;#39;s executive",570.336,2.035
order on sanctuary cities apply to those that are,572.371,4.104
undeclared sanctuary cities?,576.475,3.537
"Mr. Spicer: Well, Neil, I think there&amp;#39;s a",580.012,1.669
couple things.,581.681,1.268
The idea that Governor Malloy would not want the,582.949,4.404
law followed as enacted by Congress or by the,587.353,3.136
Connecticut legislature in any fashion seems to be,590.489,2.736
"concerning, right?",593.225,1.001
"Whether you&amp;#39;re a governor or mayor or the President,",594.226,3.37
laws are passed in this country and we expect,597.596,2.069
people and our lawmakers and our law enforcement,599.665,2.836
agencies to follow and adhere to the laws as,602.501,3.571
passed by the appropriate level of government.,606.072,3.236
"So it&amp;#39;s obviously concerning, I think, and",609.308,1.835
it&amp;#39;s troubling that that&amp;#39;s the message that he would,611.143,3.37
send to his people and to other governors.,614.513,3.637
"Because we are a nation of laws, and I think that",618.15,1.635
people need to understand that whether it&amp;#39;s the laws,619.785,2.636
that he passes as the Governor of Connecticut or,622.421,2.303
the laws that are passed through Congress and,624.724,2.636
"signed by the President, there&amp;#39;s a reason that our",627.36,2.502
democracy works.,629.862,1.135
"It&amp;#39;s because the people speak, our representatives",630.997,2.769
"at every level pass a law, and the executive in that",633.766,5.239
particular branch of government signs or vetoes,639.005,1.601
"it, and then we live by those rules.",640.606,2.836
And the idea that you can decide which laws to agree,643.442,2.236
"or not to agree with, or follow or not follow,",645.678,2.669
undermines our entire rule of law.,648.347,2.403
And so I would suggest that that is not a great,650.75,2.269
sign to be sending to the people of Connecticut and,653.019,2.736
"the people of this country, that a particular",655.755,1.835
governor chooses not to follow the duly-passed,657.59,2.302
laws of this nation.,659.892,1.401
"With respect to sanctuary cities, I think this is an",661.293,2.77
area that the American people by,664.063,3.036
huge amounts support.,667.099,2.369
They recognize their tax dollars shouldn&amp;#39;t be spent,669.468,1.869
supporting programs and activities to which people,671.337,4.004
are not entitled to.,675.341,1.902
And so I think the President has been very,677.243,2.669
"clear on this -- that if you are a sanctuary city,",679.912,2.536
"declared or undeclared, if you are providing benefits",682.448,3.37
"or services, we are going to do everything we can to",685.818,2.402
respect taxpayers and ensure that your states,688.22,2.269
follow the law. April.,690.489,1.869
"The Press: Sean, on the bathroom issue, there was",692.358,3.07
"a different comment from the President about, you",695.428,4.871
"know, if people like Caitlyn Jenner wanted to",700.299,3.17
"use this bathroom in Trump Tower, she could now.",703.469,3.904
What&amp;#39;s happened?,707.373,0.801
"Mr. Spicer: No, I think that&amp;#39;s -- so just to be",708.174,1.034
"clear, the President was asked -- at one point",709.208,2.669
"Caitlyn Jenner was in Trump Tower, and he said,",711.877,1.769
that&amp;#39;s great.,713.646,1.635
That&amp;#39;s consistent with everything he&amp;#39;s said.,715.281,1.468
It&amp;#39;s a states&amp;#39; rights issue.,716.749,2.636
And that&amp;#39;s entirely what he believes -- that if a,719.385,2.969
"state wants to pass a law or rule, or an",722.354,3.504
organization wants to do something in compliance,725.858,2.169
"with the state rule, that&amp;#39;s their right.",728.027,2.169
But it shouldn&amp;#39;t be the federal government getting,730.196,1.268
in the way of this.,731.464,1.101
"I mean, if you look at this, the law that was",732.565,1.801
passed in 1972 did not contemplate or,734.366,3.637
consider this issue.,738.003,1.735
"Number two, the procedure for this guidance letter",739.738,2.803
that was done through the Obama administration was,742.541,1.969
not properly followed.,744.51,1.301
There was no comment period.,745.811,1.502
"There was no input from parents, teachers,",747.313,1.802
students or administrators. None.,749.115,2.402
So if we think about how this was implemented last,751.517,2.336
"administration, there was zero input, there was zero",753.853,3.069
comment period offered.,756.922,1.969
Teachers and students never had any say in how,758.891,2.336
this was implemented.,761.227,1.301
"Number three, there&amp;#39;s a reason that the Texas",762.528,2.202
court had this matter enjoined.,764.73,2.002
It&amp;#39;s because it didn&amp;#39;t follow the law and it had,766.732,1.602
procedural problems.,768.334,1.368
"Four, as I mentioned, it&amp;#39;s a states&amp;#39; rights issue.",769.702,3.136
"And then five is, I think that we do have to",772.838,1.635
"recognize that children do enjoy rights, from",774.473,4.004
anti-bullying statutes that are in almost every,778.477,2.202
"state, and that there&amp;#39;s a difference between being",780.679,2.937
compassionate for individuals and children,783.616,2.435
who are struggling with something and wanting to,786.051,1.735
"make sure they&amp;#39;re protected, and how",787.786,1.736
it&amp;#39;s being done.,789.522,1.001
"And I think that the President has a big heart,",790.523,3.136
"as we&amp;#39;ve talked about in a lot of other issues, and",793.659,1.568
there&amp;#39;s a big difference.,795.227,0.968
"Personally, he addressed this issue when it came up",796.195,3.203
with respect to one of his properties.,799.398,2.369
But he also believes that that&amp;#39;s not a federal,801.767,1.702
government issue.,803.469,2.769
"It&amp;#39;s an issue left to the states, and it&amp;#39;s an issue",806.238,2.469
"that -- I mean, there&amp;#39;s a reason in August of last",808.707,2.603
"year that the court enjoined this, because it",811.31,3.37
hadn&amp;#39;t followed the law and it hadn&amp;#39;t -- the,814.68,2.636
"procedure, the comment period and the",817.316,2.302
solicitation of opinions and ideas wasn&amp;#39;t followed.,819.618,3.671
It was jammed down the process.,823.289,4.137
And so we&amp;#39;re actually following the law on this,827.426,2.169
"one, and I think that&amp;#39;s the way it&amp;#39;s",829.595,1.101
supposed to be done. John.,830.696,2.236
The Press: If I could just follow on what April said.,832.932,3.136
The Human Rights Campaign --,836.068,1.001
"The Press: I wasn&amp;#39;t finished, I&amp;#39;m sorry.",837.069,0.734
"The Press: Well, I&amp;#39;m following on",837.803,0.901
your question.,838.704,1.068
"Let me follow -- The Press: I understand that, but --",839.772,0.167
Mr. Spicer: Why don&amp;#39;t we let April follow,839.939,1.501
"on and then we&amp;#39;ll get to John, Kristen and Brian.",841.44,4.671
The Press: Yeah.,846.111,1.168
So I have one on -- I have something on another issue,847.279,0.701
"really fast, then John can do that.",847.98,1.535
"On the HBCU executive order, we understand the",849.515,3.77
executive order that&amp;#39;s coming out sometime later,853.285,1.802
"this month, it&amp;#39;s supposed to open -- you&amp;#39;re working",855.087,3.37
out issues of opening an office specifically to,858.457,3.103
take the HBCU initiative out of the Department of,861.56,3.103
Education and bring it directly under the purview,864.663,1.936
of the White House.,866.599,1.568
Who will be heading that?,868.167,1.701
Have you figured that out?,869.868,1.502
Have you also figured out how you will,871.37,1.668
build that office out?,873.038,1.502
"Because from what I understand, that is one of",874.54,1.334
the big pieces of this.,875.874,2.236
"Mr. Spicer: Well, respectfully, that&amp;#39;s why",878.11,1.401
it hasn&amp;#39;t been issued yet.,879.511,1.969
We&amp;#39;re working it through the process.,881.48,1.735
"Obviously, that is something that we&amp;#39;re",883.215,1.301
committed to getting done by the end of Black,884.516,1.702
History Month.,886.218,1.101
"So our days are numbered, but there&amp;#39;s a commitment",887.319,3.103
by the President and the staff to really focus on,890.422,2.803
this issue and give it the proper respect,893.225,2.069
that it deserves.,895.294,1.068
"So if you&amp;#39;ll bear with us a couple more days, I",896.362,2.068
promise you we&amp;#39;ll have more to say on that.,898.43,2.403
The Press: So it will be a department with the full,900.833,1.868
"-- Mr. Spicer: No, no, I just want to be clear, I&amp;#39;m",902.701,1.201
not going to get into the details.,903.902,1.936
Sort of my blanket statement on non-issued,905.838,1.668
executive orders.,907.506,1.535
But I do know that there is a commitment by the,909.041,2.102
President and the staff that he has been very,911.143,3.137
clear with us that he wants that done by the end,914.28,2.969
of this month for obvious reasons.,917.249,1.969
Now John.,919.218,1.168
The Press: Let me get back to where we were.,920.386,0.734
"The Human Rights Campaign, in responding to",921.12,1.568
"rescinding the guidance last night, said that this",922.688,3.103
"is not a states&amp;#39; rights issue, it&amp;#39;s a civil rights",925.791,2.936
"issue, and therefore is in the purview of the",928.727,1.802
federal government.,930.529,1.034
Do you disagree that this a civil rights issue?,931.563,2.403
Mr. Spicer: It&amp;#39;s not a -- it&amp;#39;s a question of where,933.966,1.702
it&amp;#39;s appropriately addressed.,935.668,2.068
"And I think there&amp;#39;s a reason -- like, we&amp;#39;ve got",937.736,0.868
"to remember, this guidance was enjoined last",938.604,0.901
August by a court.,939.505,2.102
It hasn&amp;#39;t been enforced.,941.607,3.136
There was no comment period by anyone -- by the,944.743,2.903
"Human Rights Campaign, by teachers, parents, students.",947.646,6.006
Nobody had any input of this.,953.652,2.102
And it seems to me a little interesting that if,955.754,1.735
"this was any other issue, people would be crying",957.489,2.303
foul that the process wasn&amp;#39;t followed.,959.792,2.502
"The reality is, is that when you look at Title IX,",962.294,4.571
it was enacted in 1972.,966.865,1.969
The idea that this was even contemplated at that,968.834,3.003
is preposterous on its face.,971.837,2.736
But that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that the President -- the,974.573,1.301
President obviously understands the issue and,975.874,1.769
the challenges that especially,977.643,1.201
young children face.,978.844,1.702
He just believes that this is a state issue that,980.546,1.868
"needs to be addressed by states, as he does with a",982.414,2.202
lot of other issues that we&amp;#39;ve talked about.,984.616,1.902
And so this is -- we are a states&amp;#39; rights party.,986.518,2.837
The President on a lot of issues believes in these,989.355,2.469
various issues being states&amp;#39; rights.,991.824,2.335
I don&amp;#39;t see why this would be any different.,994.159,1.735
"And again, if you go through it, it&amp;#39;s not just",995.894,1.902
"-- it&amp;#39;s how the guidance was issued, it&amp;#39;s the legal",997.796,1.936
basis on which it was ordered.,999.732,2.369
It fell short on a lot of stuff.,1002.101,1.368
It wasn&amp;#39;t us that did this; it was the court,1003.469,2.269
that stepped in and said that they hadn&amp;#39;t followed,1005.738,2.502
the procedure of the law back in August of last,1008.24,2.436
year and enjoin the case.,1010.676,1.835
"The Press: I understand all that, I&amp;#39;m just",1012.511,0.601
wondering if -- does the White House disagree with,1013.112,2.469
the position that this is a civil right?,1015.581,1.802
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think it&amp;#39;s not a question of",1017.383,1.134
"whether it&amp;#39;s a civil right, it&amp;#39;s where is it",1018.517,1.335
appropriately addressed.,1019.852,1.501
"And as I noted, it&amp;#39;s appropriately addressed at",1021.353,2.669
the state level. Kelly.,1024.022,1.268
The Press: Can I follow on that?,1025.29,0.801
"Sean, does the President believe, personally",1026.091,1.602
believe that any student who is transgender should,1027.693,2.369
be able to use the bathroom of their choice?,1030.062,2.736
His personal belief?,1032.798,1.201
Mr. Spicer: The President believes it&amp;#39;s a states&amp;#39;,1033.999,1.602
rights issue.,1035.601,1.034
And he&amp;#39;s not going to get into determining -- I,1036.635,1.902
"understand what you&amp;#39;re asking, Kelly.",1038.537,1.068
"And I think that, as April pointed out, when the",1039.605,2.469
issue came to one of his own properties he,1042.074,1.735
was very clear.,1043.809,2.102
"But again, what he doesn&amp;#39;t want to do is force his",1045.911,3.237
issues or beliefs down -- he believes it&amp;#39;s a states&amp;#39;,1049.148,1.401
rights issue --,1050.549,1.235
The Press: But the public may want to,1051.784,1.401
know where the President is on this issue.,1053.185,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: I understand that, and I think that he",1054.52,1.234
is very sympathetic to children who deal with,1055.754,1.935
that and that this is up to states and schools,1057.689,3.104
within a particular district to address how,1060.793,1.868
"they want to accommodate that, and not sort of be",1062.661,2.469
prescriptive from Washington.,1065.13,1.268
That&amp;#39;s what the President believes. Zeke.,1066.398,1.502
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1067.9,1.167
You mentioned that this order was enjoined by a,1069.067,3.371
court and there was,1072.438,0.8
criticism about the process.,1073.238,2.036
That exact same criticism has been levied on the,1075.274,2.536
"administration&amp;#39;s first executive order,",1077.81,2.135
on the travel ban.,1079.945,1.068
"I mean, can you help us square the circle here?",1081.013,1.368
Why are you relying on that same &amp;quot;enjoined by a,1082.381,3.47
federal court&amp;quot; criticism of the process for one,1085.851,3.236
but not the other?,1089.087,1.435
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think there&amp;#39;s a big difference.",1090.522,3.27
There&amp;#39;s no way that you can read Title IX from,1093.792,2.903
1972 -- anybody -- and say that that was even,1096.695,5.005
contemplated back then.,1101.7,1.235
It just -- there&amp;#39;s nobody that is possibly,1102.935,2.802
suggesting that the law that was passed in,1105.737,2.103
1972 did that.,1107.84,1.267
"Number two, there was zero comment period put forward",1109.107,3.17
"on this guidance, which is in violation of how it",1112.277,1.969
"was executed, okay?",1114.246,1.368
"And so there&amp;#39;s a big difference -- hold on,",1115.614,1.435
"hold, on let me answer the question, Zeke.",1117.049,1.301
There is also a strong reading when you,1118.35,2.336
read 1182 U.S.,1120.686,3.303
Code that it is very clear that the President does,1123.989,2.769
have the authority.,1126.758,1.368
So they are very much apples and oranges issue.,1128.126,3.371
"One, it&amp;#39;s very clear that the President is told by",1131.497,2.068
Congress in U.S.,1133.565,1.168
code that he has the authority to do what&amp;#39;s,1134.733,1.468
necessary to protect the American people.,1136.201,2.469
And there&amp;#39;s no way that anybody above a fifth,1138.67,2.736
grade reading level could interpret that different.,1141.406,2.503
There is a difference between looking at a,1143.909,1.635
statute from 1972 and saying that something was,1145.544,2.903
complicated back then.,1148.447,1.902
"Not only that -- again, it&amp;#39;s a multifaceted thing.",1150.349,1.935
"When you look at how the guidance was issued, there",1152.284,3.17
was a zero comment period.,1155.454,1.568
Nobody was able to weigh,1157.022,1.435
in on that situation back then.,1158.457,2.502
And so when you&amp;#39;re talking about forcing schools to,1160.959,1.268
"make a huge accommodation from the federal level,",1162.227,4.371
"and schools, parents, teachers, kids were not",1166.598,3.404
able to have any input in that decision from,1170.002,2.002
"Washington, I think it&amp;#39;s a very,",1172.004,1.501
very clear difference.,1173.505,1.035
John Gizzi.,1174.54,0.9
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",1175.44,2.203
"Just going back two weeks, in a story that got",1177.643,4.104
relatively little attention at the time --,1181.747,2.235
"Chuck Cooper, a very distinguished lawyer,",1183.982,2.803
asked that his name be withdrawn when he was on,1186.785,3.37
the periphery of being named U.S.,1190.155,2.035
Solicitor General.,1192.19,1.435
So my question is a two-parter.,1193.625,2.236
"First, can you confirm or deny the administration is",1195.861,3.77
"now vetting Mr. Miguel Estrada, who was a former",1199.631,4.038
"nominee for the Court of Appeals, as Solicitor",1203.669,2.769
General before the visa delay case gets to,1206.438,4.171
the Supreme Court?,1210.609,1.601
"And second, Mr. Cooper said that he did not want",1212.21,3.771
to go through the same experience that Jeff,1215.981,2.603
"Sessions, his good friend, did when he had the",1218.584,3.703
confirmation hearings and the vote in the Senate.,1222.287,4.038
Does that make the President a little bit,1226.325,1.568
discouraged about getting the nominees he wants for,1227.893,4.004
some very important positions?,1231.897,2.602
"Mr. Spicer: Well, thanks, John.",1234.499,1.402
"And I&amp;#39;d say - on the first part, as you know -- and",1235.901,2.736
I&amp;#39;ll give you the same answer we give executive,1238.637,1.134
orders -- we don&amp;#39;t comment on personnel decisions,1239.771,2.303
"until they&amp;#39;re made, until they&amp;#39;re finalized.",1242.074,2.435
So I&amp;#39;ve got nothing for that.,1244.509,0.901
"On the second part, what I would say is that the",1245.41,2.169
President is very confident we have a deep,1247.579,2.836
"bench of folks who -- during the transition, we",1250.415,2.67
talked about this -- a number of people who have,1253.085,2.168
expressed a huge interest in joining the President,1255.253,2.536
in fulfilling this agenda.,1257.789,2.002
And that list is robust and long.,1259.791,2.57
"However, that being said, I think for folks who have",1262.361,3.069
to go through the Senate confirmation and to watch,1265.43,2.303
what has happened to some of these fine individuals,1267.733,2.636
"-- the delay tactics, the tearing apart of their",1270.369,2.269
personal lives -- it is discouraging for some of,1272.638,2.202
"these people, I think, in terms of Mr. Cooper and",1274.84,3.67
"others who are looking at the process saying, I",1278.51,2.302
"would like to be part of this administration, help",1280.812,3.07
"fulfill this vision and this agenda, but this is",1283.882,2.87
what I&amp;#39;m going to have go through.,1286.752,2.302
"So while this is somewhat of an isolated case, I",1289.054,3.503
definitely understand what he&amp;#39;s talking about here.,1292.557,2.036
"And I think those are few and far between, but I",1294.593,3.437
think that when you realize what is happening,1298.03,2.769
"largely at the expense of Senate Democrats, in terms",1300.799,2.736
"of dragging these people through a very, very",1303.535,2.669
delayed and arduous process for purely,1306.204,2.069
"political points, I think that there are some people",1308.273,3.203
who could look at the process and potentially,1311.476,2.536
say I don&amp;#39;t want to serve.,1314.012,0.968
"Luckily, we&amp;#39;ve not come to that beyond a",1314.98,2.035
handful of folks.,1317.015,1.368
"Largely, people have huge desire and are willing to",1318.383,3.17
make great sacrifice -- both financially and,1321.553,2.369
personally -- to serve in the administration because,1323.922,1.935
I think they understand what potential change this,1325.857,3.704
President is bringing to this country,1329.561,2.369
and to the city.,1331.93,1.902
But I understand his point.,1333.832,1.268
"The Press: This morning, the President talked",1335.1,2.069
"about, as he often does when he talks about",1337.169,1.801
"immigrants, he talks about really bad dudes.",1338.97,2.336
Mr. Spicer: Yeah.,1341.306,0.501
The Press: You talked about precision.,1341.807,1.635
The Homeland Security Secretary this morning,1343.442,1.701
insisted there won&amp;#39;t be mass deportation.,1345.143,1.402
Mr. Spicer: Right.,1346.545,0.901
The Press: Is it the President&amp;#39;s intent or,1347.446,1.901
"desire, as some advocates worry, that people who are",1349.347,3.771
here illegally with something as simple as a,1353.118,1.702
"traffic violation, that those people will be",1354.82,2.202
subject to deportation?,1357.022,1.168
Yes or no?,1358.19,0.734
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think everybody who is in this",1358.924,2.102
country for obvious reasons -- if you overstay,1361.026,1.835
"a visa, if you commit a crime, you can&amp;#39;t -- by the",1362.861,4.238
"very nature of you not being legal, you can be",1367.099,1.935
subject to deportation.,1369.034,1.368
That&amp;#39;s by definition.,1370.402,2.502
"Being in this country is a privilege, not a right, if",1372.904,3.137
you are a visitor.,1376.041,1.068
And I think we have a right to make sure that,1377.109,3.136
the people who are in this country are here for good,1380.245,1.568
and peaceful processes.,1381.813,2.603
"And as I&amp;#39;ve said over and over again, there is",1384.416,1.101
a big difference.,1385.517,0.767
The President recognizes that there are millions of,1386.284,1.635
"people in the country who are not here legally, and",1387.919,3.204
that we have to have a very systematic and,1391.123,1.835
pragmatic and methodical process of going through,1392.958,3.47
those individuals to make sure that the people who,1396.428,2.169
pose a threat to public safety or have a criminal,1398.597,2.369
record are the first that are gone.,1400.966,1.568
What we&amp;#39;ve done -- just to be clear -- is to untie,1402.534,3.537
the hands of ICE and Border Patrol agents and,1406.071,2.235
"say, your job is to enforce the law -- first",1408.306,3.204
and foremost to figure out who poses a threat to us.,1411.51,2.068
But in the previous administration their hands,1413.578,1.669
had been tied.,1415.247,1.167
There was exception after exception after exception.,1416.414,3.17
"And the fact of the matter is, is that we have to --",1419.584,1.769
"we are a nation of laws, and we have to have a",1421.353,1.601
system of legal immigration that,1422.954,2.636
is respected.,1425.59,1.001
So I&amp;#39;m not going to be prescriptive in terms of,1426.591,3.304
what ICE&amp;#39;s job is.,1429.895,1.001
"But needless to say, their job and their mission is",1430.896,2.602
to protect the country and to enforce our borders and,1433.498,2.069
our immigration laws.,1435.567,1.268
And the President has basically instructed them,1436.835,2.736
to carry out their mission.,1439.571,1.835
"And so the priorities, as we&amp;#39;ve discussed over and",1441.406,2.102
"over and over again, is to do that is in accordance",1443.508,4.405
with the law but also prioritizes those people,1447.913,2.769
that pose a threat.,1450.682,0.834
I&amp;#39;m going to go to Roby Brock from the Talk,1451.516,2.036
Business &amp;amp; Politics in -- where is he from? Arkansas.,1453.552,4.504
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1458.056,1.401
Roby Brock with Talk Business &amp;amp; Politics here,1459.457,1.535
"in Arkansas, the home of the rowdiest town",1460.992,2.603
halls in the nation.,1463.595,2.102
I have a question on medical marijuana.,1465.697,2.736
Our state voters passed a medical marijuana,1468.433,2.77
amendment in November.,1471.203,1.835
"Now we&amp;#39;re in conflict with federal law, as many",1473.038,2.068
other states are.,1475.106,1.602
The Obama administration kind of chose not to,1476.708,3.303
strictly enforce those federal marijuana laws.,1480.011,2.536
My question to you is: With Jeff Sessions over at,1482.547,2.803
"the Department of Justice as AG, what&amp;#39;s going to be",1485.35,4.071
the Trump administration&amp;#39;s position on marijuana,1489.421,1.835
legalization where it&amp;#39;s in a state-federal,1491.256,2.102
conflict like this?,1493.358,1.869
"Mr. Spicer: Thanks, Roby.",1495.227,0.867
There&amp;#39;s two distinct issues here: medical,1496.094,2.469
marijuana and recreational marijuana.,1498.563,2.77
"I think medical marijuana, I&amp;#39;ve said before that the",1501.333,4.037
President understands the pain and suffering that,1505.37,4.304
many people go through who are facing especially,1509.674,2.603
terminal diseases and the comfort that some of these,1512.277,3.37
"drugs, including medical marijuana,",1515.647,1.501
can bring to them.,1517.148,1.635
"And that&amp;#39;s one that Congress, through a rider",1518.783,1.635
in 2011 -- looking for a little help -- I think put,1520.418,5.005
in an appropriations bill saying the Department of,1525.423,2.002
Justice wouldn&amp;#39;t be funded to go after those folks.,1527.425,4.738
There is a big difference between that and,1532.163,2.837
recreational marijuana.,1535,1.334
And I think that when you see something like the,1536.334,2.369
opioid addiction crisis blossoming in so many,1538.703,4.205
"states around this country, the last thing",1542.908,2.002
that we should be doing is encouraging people.,1544.91,1.968
There is still a federal law that we need to abide,1546.878,2.503
by in terms of the medical -- when it comes to,1549.381,3.436
recreational marijuana and other drugs,1552.817,2.369
of that nature.,1555.186,0.568
So I think there&amp;#39;s a big difference between medical,1555.754,2.736
"marijuana, which states have a -- the states where",1558.49,3.403
"it&amp;#39;s allowed, in accordance with the",1561.893,1.702
"appropriations rider, have set forth a process to",1563.595,3.337
"administer and regulate that usage, versus",1566.932,5.705
recreational marijuana.,1572.637,1.101
"That&amp;#39;s a very, very different subject.",1573.738,1.635
Shannon.,1575.373,0.601
The Press: What does that mean in terms of policy?,1575.974,0.5
"A follow-up, Sean.",1576.474,0.768
What does that mean in terms of policy?,1577.242,0.867
"Mr. Spicer: Shannon. Glenn, this isn&amp;#39;t a TV program.",1578.109,1.836
We&amp;#39;re going to,1579.945,0.667
-- The Press: What is the Justice,1580.612,0.534
Department going to do?,1581.146,0.467
"Mr. Spicer: Okay, you don&amp;#39;t get to just",1581.613,0.801
yell out questions.,1582.414,0.734
We&amp;#39;re going to raise our hands like big,1583.148,0.7
boys and girls.,1583.848,1.035
The Press: Why don&amp;#39;t you answer the,1584.883,1.635
"question, though?",1586.518,0.801
Mr. Spicer: Because it&amp;#39;s not your job to just yell,1587.319,0.6
out questions.,1587.919,0.434
"Shannon, please go.",1588.353,0.567
The Press: Okay.,1588.92,0.467
"Well, first, on the manufacturing summit, was",1589.387,2.703
the AFL-CIO invited?,1592.09,2.336
"And then, yeah, I did want to follow up on this",1594.426,1.668
medical marijuana question.,1596.094,1.902
So is the federal government then going to,1597.996,1.635
take some sort of action around this recreational,1599.631,3.07
marijuana in some of these states?,1602.701,2.068
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think that&amp;#39;s a question for the",1604.769,1.302
Department of Justice.,1606.071,1.167
I do believe that you&amp;#39;ll see greater,1607.238,1.102
enforcement of it.,1608.34,1.601
"Because again, there&amp;#39;s a big difference between the",1609.941,2.87
"medical use which Congress has, through an",1612.811,2.302
"appropriations rider in 2014, made very clear what",1615.113,5.739
their intent was in terms of how the Department of,1620.852,4.505
Justice would handle that issue.,1625.357,1.568
"That&amp;#39;s very different than the recreational use,",1626.925,2.936
which is something the Department of Justice I,1629.861,1.335
think will be further looking into.,1631.196,2.702
"I&amp;#39;m sorry, Shannon, what was the first part?",1633.898,1.235
The Press: Was the AFL-CIO invited to the,1635.133,2.135
manufacturing meeting today with the CFOs?,1637.268,2.002
Because they are part of this manufacturing --,1639.27,1.302
Mr. Spicer: Right.,1640.572,0.7
I think this was just focused on people who,1641.272,2.269
"actually -- they were not, I don&amp;#39;t believe,",1643.541,2.136
part of this one.,1645.677,1.635
"As you know, that we&amp;#39;ve had union representation",1647.312,2.202
at other meetings.,1649.514,1.134
I think this was specifically for people,1650.648,1.669
who are hiring people and the impediments that,1652.317,2.903
"they&amp;#39;re having to create additional jobs,",1655.22,2.536
hire more people.,1657.756,1.067
"And obviously, while the President values their",1658.823,3.103
opinion -- and that&amp;#39;s why they&amp;#39;ve been involved in,1661.926,1.902
some of the past -- this was specifically a,1663.828,2.236
"manufacturing -- people who hire people, who",1666.064,2.903
"manufacture, who grow the economy, who grow jobs.",1668.967,2.836
And that is a vastly different situation.,1671.803,1.535
Andrei.,1673.338,4.004
The Press: I specifically sat here next to John to have --,1677.342,2.469
Mr. Spicer: One can see --,1679.811,2.102
The Press: You know me.,1681.913,0.934
(Laughter.) Thank you.,1682.847,1.302
A question on Russia.,1684.149,1.268
Secretary Tillerson and General Dunford have had,1685.417,3.136
meetings with their Russian counterparts.,1688.553,3.237
Is the President pleased with the results,1691.79,1.701
of the meetings?,1693.491,0.968
Mr. Spicer: Yes.,1694.459,1.068
The Press: And what comes next?,1695.527,1.268
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, both of them had an opportunity to",1696.795,2.936
meet with their counterparts in different,1699.731,2.302
"locations, ironically on the same day.",1702.033,1.168
I believe that was yesterday.,1703.201,2.769
"And they both had very, very productive",1705.97,1.802
discussions.,1707.772,1.335
The President was very pleased with the outcome,1709.107,1.668
"of that, and so I would refer you back to both",1710.775,2.569
General Dunford and Secretary Tillerson,1713.344,2.036
on those.,1715.38,0.467
The Press: You started discussing the where and,1715.847,4.004
when for the summit for the leaders meeting?,1719.851,3.804
"Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t have any updates on that, but",1723.655,1.401
I&amp;#39;ll look into that.,1725.056,1.368
Cecilia.,1726.424,1.502
"The Press: Sean, I just want to follow up.",1727.926,0.834
"I want to clarify, make sure I understand",1728.76,1.168
what you said.,1729.928,1.067
"You said, you will see greater enforcement of it?",1730.995,2.47
Mr. Spicer: I would refer you to the Department of Justice,1733.465,1.167
"-- The Press: But you said, you said there",1734.632,1.569
will be greater enforcement.,1736.201,0.6
"Mr. Spicer: No, no.",1736.801,0.367
I know.,1737.168,0.868
I know what I -- I think -- then that&amp;#39;s,1738.036,1.168
what I said.,1739.204,1.434
But I think the Department of Justice is,1740.638,1.602
the lead on that.,1742.24,1.201
It is something that you should follow up with,1743.441,1.368
"them, but I believe that they are going to continue",1744.809,2.67
to enforce the laws on the books with respect to,1747.479,4.604
recreational marijuana versus,1752.083,0.534
-- The Press: Okay. And my real question,1752.617,0.701
if you don&amp;#39;t mind.,1753.318,0.7
Mr. Spicer: That first one was pretty real.,1754.018,1.635
The Press: Ivanka Trump was in the White House,1755.653,2.136
today for a meeting on human trafficking.,1757.789,2.202
She had this meeting on CEOs.,1759.991,2.936
We saw her in a smaller session here at,1762.927,2.036
the White House today.,1764.963,0.867
What exactly is her role here?,1765.83,1.769
Mr. Spicer: I think her role is to be helpful and,1767.599,1.268
provide input on a variety of areas that she has,1768.867,4.371
"deep, passionate concerns about, especially in the",1773.238,2.869
area of women in the workforce and,1776.107,1.435
empowering women.,1777.542,1.835
She is someone who has a lot of expertise and wants,1779.377,4.271
"to offer that, especially in the area of",1783.648,3.537
trying to help women.,1787.185,1.034
She understands that firsthand.,1788.219,1.835
"And I think because of the success that she&amp;#39;s had,",1790.054,4.004
her goal is to try to figure out -- and the,1794.058,1.569
understanding that she has a businesswoman -- to use,1795.627,3.069
her expertise and understanding to empower,1798.696,4.905
and help women have the same kind of opportunity,1803.601,1.435
and success that she&amp;#39;s had. So --,1805.036,1.468
The Press: But still not a formal role?,1806.504,1.268
"Mr. Spicer: No, nothing more than you&amp;#39;ve seen now.",1807.772,3.103
"I think, last night, the meeting that she had in",1810.875,2.403
Baltimore was one that was done on her own.,1813.278,4.337
There&amp;#39;s areas that she&amp;#39;s cared very passionately,1817.615,2.202
"about before her time in the White House, or before",1819.817,2.937
"her father coming to the White House, rather.",1822.754,2.903
"And now that her father is in the White House, she",1825.657,2.269
continues to seek a platform that helps,1827.926,1.701
"empower and lift up women, and give them",1829.627,2.069
opportunities and think of ways that they can be --,1831.696,3.437
"The Press: Sean, thanks.",1835.133,1.568
"On the human trafficking meeting today, the",1836.701,2.87
"President said, well, when you talk about solving",1839.571,3.436
"this kind of problem, that&amp;#39;s a nice word, but",1843.007,1.769
"it&amp;#39;s really -- he suggested that, more",1844.776,3.136
"likely, he could just help out on that problem.",1847.912,2.803
What&amp;#39;s his definition of success in this?,1850.715,2.436
What&amp;#39;s his goal?,1853.151,0.667
Is he looking at stronger criminal penalties?,1853.818,2.169
"Mr. Spicer: Well, Dave, I think that&amp;#39;s, as I read",1855.987,1.568
"out earlier, that the President understands that",1857.555,2.036
"this is a serious problem both for adults, but",1859.591,3.203
particularly for children who are being sold both,1862.794,2.202
"domestically and internationally, and it&amp;#39;s",1864.996,1.735
why we brought these groups in.,1866.731,2.135
It&amp;#39;s to make sure that we figure out how do we make,1868.866,1.802
that number as close to zero as possible and that,1870.668,2.503
"we institute policies both domestically, but then",1873.171,4.037
"abroad, and working with our partners to figure out",1877.208,2.036
how do we combat the trafficking of people.,1879.244,2.302
So it&amp;#39;s things that we can be forceful in terms of,1881.546,6.106
"the rhetoric that the President uses, but also",1887.652,1.835
the enforcement tools that he uses both domestically,1889.487,1.435
and internationally. Trey.,1890.922,0.834
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1891.756,0.767
Has the President been briefed at all on the,1892.523,1.769
situation at Standing Rock?,1894.292,1.435
And is he concerned that a stand-off with protesters,1895.727,2.402
could slow down his executive orders,1898.129,1.602
on pipelines?,1899.731,2.035
Mr. Spicer: Our team has been involved with both,1901.766,2.202
"the tribe and the governor there, and so we are not",1903.968,3.304
only -- we are constantly in touch with them.,1907.272,1.868
And I think we feel very confident that we will,1909.14,2.302
move forward to get the pipeline moving.,1911.442,3.237
"And so we&amp;#39;ll have a further update on that,",1914.679,2.703
but I think we&amp;#39;re in constant contact with,1917.382,1.167
the officials there.,1918.549,0.701
Kristen.,1919.25,0.534
"The Press: Sean, thank you.",1919.784,0.634
"Two topics I&amp;#39;d like to ask, but I wanted to start",1920.418,1.802
off by following on the transgender directive.,1922.22,3.07
Eight-two percent of transgender children,1925.29,2.369
report feeling unsafe at school.,1927.659,2.369
So isn&amp;#39;t the President leaving some of these,1930.028,1.835
children open to vulnerable -- to being,1931.863,2.903
bullied at school?,1934.766,0.867
Mr. Spicer: No.,1935.633,0.601
"I mean, there are bullying laws and policies in place",1936.234,3.27
in almost every one of these schools.,1939.504,1.701
The Press: Transgender children say their experience is,1941.205,1.535
Mr. Spicer: But I don&amp;#39;t think -- hold on --,1942.74,1.168
The Press: -- not being able,1943.908,1.235
to use the bathroom that they feel comfortable,1945.143,2.402
using because of vulnerability to bullying.,1947.545,0.968
"Mr. Spicer: But again, you&amp;#39;re missing the point",1948.513,1.067
"here, Kristen.",1949.58,0.768
The President said literally it should be a,1950.348,2.269
state decision.,1952.617,1.868
He respects the decision of the state.,1954.485,1.535
So therefore --,1956.02,0.501
The Press: So respecting kids is a states&amp;#39; rights issue?,1956.521,1.468
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, that&amp;#39;s not -- you&amp;#39;re trying to",1957.989,1.535
make an issue out of something that,1959.524,0.867
doesn&amp;#39;t exist.,1960.391,0.935
It was the court who stopped this in,1961.326,1.334
August of last year.,1962.66,1.669
So where were the questions last year in,1964.329,2.335
August about this?,1966.664,1.969
"It wasn&amp;#39;t implemented correctly, legally, and",1968.633,2.703
the procedure wasn&amp;#39;t followed because the court,1971.336,2.202
"found, at the time, that it didn&amp;#39;t have the",1973.538,1.902
authority to do that.,1975.44,1.635
So you&amp;#39;re asking us why we&amp;#39;re following the law,1977.075,3.77
that wasn&amp;#39;t followed.,1980.845,1.502
And the reality is --,1982.347,0.4
"The Press: Well, I&amp;#39;m asking",1982.747,0.968
you why you&amp;#39;re reversing the Obama directive --,1983.715,0.767
Mr. Spicer: Hold on.,1984.482,0.534
"No, no, we&amp;#39;re not reversing it.",1985.016,0.801
Hold on.,1985.817,0.6
We&amp;#39;re not reversing it.,1986.417,1.368
That is a misinterpretation,1987.785,2.202
of the scenario.,1989.987,1.569
The court stopped it.,1991.556,1.668
It enjoined it in August of last year because it,1993.224,3.17
"wasn&amp;#39;t properly drafted, and it didn&amp;#39;t follow the",1996.394,2.269
"procedures, and there was no legal basis for it in a",1998.663,2.569
law that was instituted in 1972.,2001.232,1.969
"So hold on -- for you to use those terms, frankly,",2003.201,2.669
doesn&amp;#39;t reflect what the situation actually is and,2005.87,3.17
how it happened.,2009.04,1.435
That&amp;#39;s just -- so to talk about us reversing,2010.475,2.002
something that was stopped by the courts.,2012.477,2.269
The Press: I understand that --,2014.746,0.934
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, but --",2015.68,1.368
The Press: -- but you&amp;#39;re sending a message --,2017.048,0.734
"Mr. Spicer: No, we&amp;#39;re not. We&amp;#39;re basically saying",2017.782,1.001
that it&amp;#39;s a states&amp;#39; rights issue.,2018.783,1.134
"If a state choses to do it, as I mentioned to",2019.917,1.936
"April, when this circumstance came up at",2021.853,2.269
"one of the President&amp;#39;s own properties, he was very",2024.122,1.735
clear about his position on this.,2025.857,1.968
So for you to turn around and say what message is,2027.825,1.802
"the President saying, where was the message when",2029.627,1.969
he sent it last year?,2031.596,2.636
I think the message shows that he&amp;#39;s a guy with a,2034.232,1.501
heart that understands the trouble that many people,2035.733,1.902
go through.,2037.635,1.168
But he also believes that the proper legal recourse,2038.803,2.436
for this is with the states.,2041.239,2.269
He believes in the states&amp;#39; ability to determine,2043.508,2.535
what&amp;#39;s right for their state versus,2046.043,1.836
another state.,2047.879,0.867
The Press: I understand what you&amp;#39;re saying.,2048.746,1.001
But the LGBTQ community yesterday said they felt --,2049.747,2.836
Mr. Spicer: I understand what --,2052.583,0.768
The Press: -- that what they perceiving is that those,2053.351,1.301
kids are not being respected.,2054.652,0.768
Mr. Spicer: But there&amp;#39;s a difference what people may,2055.42,1.568
or may not feel and the legal process and the law.,2056.988,4.704
And the law right now doesn&amp;#39;t allow for it under,2061.692,2.303
Title IX that was passed in 1972.,2063.995,2.836
And the procedure wasn&amp;#39;t followed.,2066.831,1.702
The court saw this in August of last year,2068.533,3.236
for a reason.,2071.769,1.301
And all we&amp;#39;re doing is saying that the proper,2073.07,1.936
place for this is in the states.,2075.006,2.636
And so for you to suggest what message is this,2077.642,3.27
"sending, it&amp;#39;s very simple: that it&amp;#39;s a states&amp;#39; rights",2080.912,2.836
"issue, and the states should enact laws that",2083.748,2.202
"reflect the values, principles, and will of",2085.95,2.436
the people in their particular state.,2088.386,2.169
"That&amp;#39;s it, plain and simple.",2090.555,1.401
"The Press: Moving on to Obamacare very quickly,",2091.956,1.802
former House Speaker John Boehner predicted that a,2093.758,3.303
full repeal and replace of Obamacare -- his words --,2097.061,3.57
&amp;quot;is not going to happen.&amp;quot;,2100.631,2.403
"He went on to say, &amp;quot;Most of the framework of the",2103.034,1.768
"Affordable Care Act, it&amp;#39;s going to be there.&amp;quot;",2104.802,2.403
Do you think that he has a point?,2107.205,2.202
Are you going to --,2109.407,0.534
"Mr. Spicer: Well, no, I think --",2109.941,0.634
"look, I think what we&amp;#39;re going to end up with",2110.575,2.636
is something that I&amp;#39;ve talked about over and over again.,2113.211,1.968
We&amp;#39;re going to end up with a more accessible plan,2115.179,3.837
"that will allow people to see more doctors, have",2119.016,1.969
"more providers, and drive costs down.",2120.985,2.169
Those are the two guiding principles that we&amp;#39;re,2123.154,1.735
going to have in what the President is going to work,2124.889,2.769
with Congress to put forward on.,2127.658,1.635
"That&amp;#39;s it, plain and simple. Yes.",2129.293,1.202
"The Press: Sean, on roads and highways in the United",2130.495,1.334
"States, in many places around the country",2131.829,2.136
potholes and other issues are affecting the way in,2133.965,2.302
which Americans travel.,2136.267,1.101
And the President has said he would fix these issues,2137.368,1.602
during the campaign.,2138.97,1.268
What is the status on that?,2140.238,1.301
And has the President spoken to heads of DOT or,2141.539,2.102
other people?,2143.641,1.301
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think the President is starting",2144.942,1.402
to address that through the budget process we,2146.344,1.368
talked about yesterday.,2147.712,1.168
It will be out in mid-March.,2148.88,1.434
And so the infrastructure projects and priorities,2150.314,3.37
that the President has talked about -- whether,2153.684,2.469
"it&amp;#39;s air control, and our airports, or the roads and",2156.153,2.336
bridges -- will be something that he&amp;#39;s going,2158.489,2.036
"to work with DOT, but also talk about in his budget.",2160.525,3.67
And you&amp;#39;ll see more in his joint address to Congress.,2164.195,3.537
"With that, Laurel Staples of KECI-NBC in Montana.",2167.732,5.572
The Press: Montana has hundreds of miles of,2173.304,1.768
border with Canada.,2175.072,1.001
And according to the U.S.,2176.073,1.168
"Department of Transportation, almost 1",2177.241,2.036
million people come across that border into Montana,2179.277,2.769
each year.,2182.046,1.335
What are the administration&amp;#39;s plans to,2183.381,2.135
increase security on the Canadian border?,2185.516,1.969
And does the administration have any,2187.485,1.535
plans to build a wall there?,2189.02,3.203
"(Laughter.) Mr. Spicer: Well, we&amp;#39;re obviously",2192.223,2.703
concerned -- thank you -- at all sorts of,2194.926,3.37
"immigration in this country, whether it&amp;#39;s from",2198.296,2.302
our northern border or our southern border.,2200.598,1.601
I think the President understands that our,2202.199,1.235
southern border is where we have more of a concern,2203.434,3.604
in terms of the number of people and the type of,2207.038,2.168
activity that&amp;#39;s coming over there in terms of the,2209.206,3.104
cartels and drug activity.,2212.31,1.534
But that doesn&amp;#39;t mean that we&amp;#39;re not paying attention,2213.844,2.403
"to our northern border, as well.",2216.247,2.336
And we will continue to both monitor and take,2218.583,2.068
steps necessary at our northern border to ensure,2220.651,3.404
the safety of all Americans.,2224.055,1.668
"Yes, sir.",2225.723,2.903
The Press: One question on the South China Sea and a,2228.626,1.535
follow-up on the Dakota Access Pipeline.,2230.161,3.67
"This week was the first week, I believe, that the",2233.831,2.87
Trump administration launched freedom of,2236.701,1.534
navigation operations in the South China Sea.,2238.235,2.269
Can you give us a sense of how frequently you are,2240.504,2.503
going to be doing those?,2243.007,1.868
"And then on the Dakota Access Pipeline, a few",2244.875,2.069
weeks ago President Trump said he would try to,2246.944,1.769
negotiate a solution between the Standing Rock,2248.713,2.168
Sioux and Energy Transfer Partners.,2250.881,3.604
Why hasn&amp;#39;t the President intervened and tried to,2254.485,2.803
initiate those negotiations yet?,2257.288,2.602
"Mr. Spicer: So on the latter, our team has been",2259.89,2.77
in contact with all the parties involved.,2262.66,1.668
They have been working and communicating,2264.328,1.935
back and forth.,2266.263,0.868
So if we have an update on that -- but there has been,2267.131,3.17
work at the staff level between the parties.,2270.301,4.137
"And then on the second -- on the first part, I&amp;#39;ve",2274.438,2.236
got no further update in terms of the frequency by,2276.674,2.102
which we will have stuff.,2278.776,1.235
Alexis.,2280.011,0.8
"The Press: Sean, in the Reuters interview with the",2280.811,3.737
"President, he described again his interest in",2284.548,1.969
seeing the nuclear arsenal,2286.517,1.602
expand in the United States.,2288.119,1.701
Can you describe what it is that the President has,2289.82,2.369
in mind -- the timeframe and how he would like,2292.189,1.802
to pursue that?,2293.991,1.268
"Mr. Spicer: Yes, let&amp;#39;s just be clear.",2295.259,1.201
He didn&amp;#39;t -- what he was very clear on is that the,2296.46,2.403
United States will not yield its supremacy in,2298.863,4.337
this area to anybody.,2303.2,2.336
That&amp;#39;s what he made very clear in there.,2305.536,1.101
And that if other countries have nuclear,2306.637,3.003
"capabilities, it will always be the United",2309.64,2.169
States that has the supremacy and,2311.809,4.037
commitment to this.,2315.846,0.768
"Obviously, that&amp;#39;s not what we&amp;#39;re seeking to do.",2316.614,2.736
The question that was asked was about other,2319.35,1.501
people growing their stockpiles.,2320.851,1.969
And I think what he has been clear on is that our,2322.82,1.869
goal is to make sure that we maintain America&amp;#39;s,2324.689,3.269
"dominance around the world, and that if other",2327.958,4.004
"countries cloud it, we don&amp;#39;t sit back and allow",2331.962,1.502
them to grow theirs. Francesca.,2333.464,2.135
"The Press: Sean, a domestic policy question",2335.599,1.535
"and then a foreign policy question, if you will.",2337.134,2.57
You said yesterday that the President had named a,2339.704,2.569
task force on the voter fraud probe.,2342.273,2.869
When did he name that task force specifically?,2345.142,3.437
Mr. Spicer: I think two weeks ago he announced,2348.579,1.869
that Vice President Pence would lead that task,2350.448,4.17
"force, and that the Vice President and his team",2354.618,2.303
were starting to look at members to do that.,2356.921,2.035
The Press: So you were referring to the interview,2358.956,1.769
in which he said there would be a task force.,2360.725,1.534
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s right.,2362.259,0.601
The Press: Not that something has,2362.86,0.667
happened since then.,2363.527,0.801
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s correct.,2364.328,0.534
The Press: Okay.,2364.862,0.534
"And then on foreign policy, the President had",2365.396,1.501
said in his Saturday campaign speech that the,2366.897,3.304
Gulf States would be paying for that,2370.201,1.935
safe zone in Syria.,2372.136,1.702
Which Gulf States was he referring to?,2373.838,1.801
Have any committed to paying for that?,2375.639,1.702
Mr. Spicer: So if you look at the readouts that he&amp;#39;s,2377.341,1.435
had with several of the foreign leaders that is,2378.776,2.302
brought up and mentioned,2381.078,1.068
in almost every one of them.,2382.146,1.034
And I think he&amp;#39;s talked about the financing of the,2383.18,1.769
safe zones and the commitment that they need,2384.949,2.803
to make to those.,2387.752,0.834
"And I think by and large,",2388.586,1.701
we&amp;#39;ve had widespread commitment.,2390.287,2.403
When we have an update on -- and I think that&amp;#39;s an,2392.69,1.868
issue that&amp;#39;s going to be ongoing at the Secretary,2394.558,2.803
"of State level, as well, where you saw Secretary",2397.361,2.436
Tillerson follow up on that with numerous folks.,2399.797,3.103
We will have further updates on the funding of,2402.9,1.802
safe zones as we go forward.,2404.702,2.836
But there has been a general commitment by most,2407.538,4.071
of these heads of government to share in the,2411.609,2.135
President&amp;#39;s commitment to help fund these things.,2413.744,2.236
Can I go to Steve Gruber of WJIM in Michigan?,2415.98,3.97
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",2419.95,0.467
I greatly appreciate it.,2420.417,0.968
"I&amp;#39;d like to talk to you more about tax policy,",2421.385,1.668
if I may.,2423.053,1.302
"President Trump, of course, on the campaign",2424.355,1.568
trail talked a lot about tax policy and tax reform.,2425.923,4.304
"That hasn&amp;#39;t happened yet, as we know.",2430.227,1.368
But I want to talk about something different.,2431.595,1.068
That&amp;#39;s the border adjustability tax.,2432.663,2.102
With the manufacturers that were at the White,2434.765,1.235
"House again today, states like Michigan,",2436,1.968
"Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, others have a great",2437.968,1.735
"concern about this tax, and there seems to be a",2439.703,2.503
"disconnect between some of the CEOs, some of the",2442.206,1.902
Republicans on Capitol Hill and the President as,2444.108,3.036
to whether or not this is appropriate.,2447.144,1.135
And I guess the question is: Could this tax have a,2448.279,2.335
chilling effect on manufacturing at a time,2450.614,1.835
"when places like Ohio, and Michigan, and the Upper",2452.449,1.902
Midwest are trying to jumpstart the economy with,2454.351,2.87
manufacturing jobs?,2457.221,1.535
"I wish for you to clarify, if you could, the",2458.756,2.669
President&amp;#39;s position.,2461.425,1.869
"Mr. Spicer: Yes, Steve, thank you.",2463.294,0.967
I think the President has been very clear from the,2464.261,1.635
beginning that there is no tax if companies,2465.896,2.102
manufacture in the United States.,2467.998,1.435
We are one of only a handful of countries that,2469.433,3.003
doesn&amp;#39;t tax the imports that come,2472.436,5.105
into our country.,2477.541,0.968
Almost every other country operates their tax code,2478.509,2.002
under that system.,2480.511,1.635
And so what happens is we have a system by which,2482.146,2.536
companies abroad can send their products -- tax our,2484.682,4.804
products going into their country and institute an,2489.486,2.47
"import tax, and then their products come into the",2491.956,2.369
"United States with no import tax -- which,",2494.325,2.569
"frankly, gives a disincentive to companies",2496.894,2.135
"to stay in the United States, to manufacture in",2499.029,2.169
"the United States, to hire in the United States.",2501.198,2.302
And it tilts the field,2503.5,1.836
against the American worker.,2505.336,1.768
And so the President is looking at tax policy that,2507.104,5.339
encourages manufacturing and job creation in,2512.443,3.27
the United States.,2515.713,2.002
And if you think about it --,2517.715,0.8
The Press: So where is,2518.515,0.768
he on this border adjustability tax?,2519.283,0.601
Mr. Spicer: Hold on.,2519.884,0.433
The Press: Where is he on this tax specifically?,2520.317,1.268
Mr. Spicer: I understand that.,2521.585,1.969
And I think that what he is doing is he met,2523.554,1.068
yesterday with his team on the budget.,2524.622,2.535
He&amp;#39;s talked to Secretary Mnuchin and others who are,2527.157,3.37
working on a comprehensive tax reform plan.,2530.527,2.336
"And remember, Steve, this isn&amp;#39;t something that&amp;#39;s",2532.863,1.568
been done since 1986.,2534.431,2.236
"And so as we look at it, part of that is to make",2536.667,3.704
"sure that we lower our corporate tax rate, that",2540.371,3.403
we make it more attractive to manufacture and grow,2543.774,2.236
"jobs in the United States, to make our companies more",2546.01,2.569
"competitive with companies overseas that, frankly,",2548.579,2.502
have better tax treatment than our own companies who,2551.081,2.469
stay in the United States.,2553.55,1.068
So creating more of a playing field that,2554.618,2.336
encourages manufacturing and growing and creating,2556.954,4.271
in the United States.,2561.225,1.668
"But make no mistake, if a company is in the United",2562.893,1.969
States already and expanding in the United,2564.862,2.335
"States, it will be only to their benefit.",2567.197,3.137
"Actually, if you think about it right now, the",2570.334,2.903
"way the current tax code works, it almost",2573.237,2.502
incentivizes companies from leaving the United,2575.739,2.136
"States, manufacturing, and expanding overseas, and",2577.875,3.403
then sending their goods and services back to the,2581.278,2.336
"United States, which undermines our own",2583.614,2.502
"economy, it undermines our workers.",2586.116,1.969
The Press: But the question is about,2588.085,1.101
components coming back in the United States being,2589.186,2.236
manufactured.,2591.422,0.5
"Mr. Spicer: I understand, Steve.",2591.922,1.235
"Okay, I know that you&amp;#39;re on the Skype, but we only",2593.157,1.268
do like one or two follow-ups.,2594.425,1.167
"But the answer is, is that he&amp;#39;s working towards",2595.592,3.971
"comprehensive tax reform, and we&amp;#39;ll have a plan out",2599.563,3.103
within the next few weeks that will address that. Yes.,2602.666,3.404
"The Press: On the transgender guidance, the",2606.07,1.201
"administration not only rescinded it, but sent a",2607.271,1.768
letter to the Supreme Court informing them about,2609.039,2.002
the change as they consider a related case.,2611.041,2.202
Does the termination of the guidance present an,2613.243,1.802
administration position on the way the Supreme Court,2615.045,1.902
should rule?,2616.947,1.502
"Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sorry, on?",2618.449,0.967
"Well, obviously, we&amp;#39;re -- I&amp;#39;m sorry -- removing the",2619.416,1.735
guidance clearly does.,2621.151,2.403
The guidance that was put forward by the Obama,2623.554,2.502
"administration, which clearly hadn&amp;#39;t been done",2626.056,3.47
"in a proper way in terms of how they solicited, or,",2629.526,2.77
"rather, didn&amp;#39;t solicit comments -- the guidance",2632.296,1.868
it puts forward obviously sends a signal to the,2634.164,3.07
Court on where the administration stands,2637.234,1.368
on this issue.,2638.602,2.369
The Press: Can I ask you about Syria?,2640.971,1.802
Two quick questions.,2642.773,2.569
"First, the talks have started again, peace",2645.342,2.569
talks in Geneva.,2647.911,1.335
"The man convening them, Staffan de Mistura, says",2649.246,2.436
he&amp;#39;s not detected a clear strategy on the political,2651.682,2.569
track from the administration.,2654.251,2.169
So what is the President&amp;#39;s thinking on that?,2656.42,1.668
"And in particular, what&amp;#39;s his thinking on the future",2658.088,3.337
"of President Assad, whether he can stay on in",2661.425,2.035
a transition or --,2663.46,1.135
Mr. Spicer: I will refer you to,2664.595,1.435
the State Department on the status of the talks.,2666.03,1.901
The Press: But the overall strategy comes from here.,2667.931,2.136
"Mr. Spicer: Right, I understand that.",2670.067,1.234
"And that&amp;#39;s one of the things that the President,",2671.301,1.168
whether it&amp;#39;s safe zones or how we deal with Syria and,2672.469,3.837
the problems that --,2676.306,0.968
The Press: What&amp;#39;s the President thinking on,2677.274,0.768
Assad&amp;#39;s future?,2678.042,0.6
Just the key points.,2678.642,1.034
"Mr. Spicer: I understand that, thank you.",2679.676,1.035
"The Press: One other question then on Syria, if",2680.711,2.502
you don&amp;#39;t mind.,2683.213,1.502
"The fall of al-Bab in northern Syria, an",2684.715,3.203
"important development on the battlefield, creates",2687.918,2.736
some space in that town that&amp;#39;s fallen to the Turks,2690.654,4.004
and opposition.,2694.658,2.903
Is that the sort of space that the President would,2697.561,1.134
like to see a safe zone?,2698.695,0.735
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t -- we&amp;#39;re not trying to be,2699.43,2.435
prescriptive right now in terms of the geographic,2701.865,1.168
location of a safe zone.,2703.033,2.736
"It&amp;#39;s something that -- right now, the President&amp;#39;s",2705.769,1.368
"goal is to get commitments from other world leaders,",2707.137,2.536
both in terms of the funding and the commitment,2709.673,2.202
to share in how we do that.,2711.875,3.537
So I don&amp;#39;t want to get -- we&amp;#39;re not looking to be,2715.412,2.336
prescriptive today in how it&amp;#39;s done.,2717.748,3.303
"I think, overall, we need a greater commitment in",2721.051,1.802
the region to make sure that people are committed,2722.853,3.237
to a strategy and to safe zones to allow that to,2726.09,3.136
stop some of the human suffering that&amp;#39;s going on,2729.226,4.605
and create -- while the rest of the,2733.831,4.037
conflict ensues.,2737.868,3.337
And I think that we&amp;#39;ve got to dual-track this -- deal,2741.205,3.036
with the conflict as a whole and how we address,2744.241,2.269
"it, how we deal with ISIS in combatting it, but then",2746.51,3.904
we also have to -- there&amp;#39;s a humanitarian piece to,2750.414,1.334
this as well with respect to the safe zones.,2751.748,1.736
And I think that we were looking at both pieces of,2753.484,1.034
this as well.,2754.518,1.702
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",2756.22,1.635
"Since the election, Secretary of State Rex",2757.855,3.803
Tillerson has expressed some disquiet about,2761.658,2.803
pulling out of the Paris agreement on,2764.461,1.769
climate change.,2766.23,0.934
And the President has also heard from some world,2767.164,2.069
leaders about that.,2769.233,2.702
"Can you tell us, is the President still committed",2771.935,2.069
to pulling out of the,2774.004,0.734
Paris agreement on climate change?,2774.738,2.169
Mr. Spicer: I think I will leave that to,2776.907,1.101
Secretary Tillerson.,2778.008,1.535
That&amp;#39;s a conversation that he&amp;#39;s having with him as,2779.543,2.235
far as where we are on that.,2781.778,1.736
"The Press: Sean, thank you very much.",2783.514,1.668
I just have a follow-up to the Syria question first.,2785.182,1.835
Do you have any timeline when it comes to when he,2787.017,2.302
wants to see those safe zones actually,2789.319,1.502
being built?,2790.821,1.068
And I wanted to go back to the executive order,2791.889,2.035
on immigration.,2793.924,1.401
"You&amp;#39;ve talked about these dual-tracks, where you&amp;#39;re",2795.325,1.902
going to be doing the new executive order but also,2797.227,1.802
continuing to fight that in court.,2799.029,1.768
Can you give us a status update on where that legal,2800.797,2.57
fight is and what we should see happening?,2803.367,2.235
Mr. Spicer: So with respect to the executive,2805.602,2.369
"order, there are several courts that this is being",2807.971,2.736
fought in -- 10 or so -- and we continue to deal,2810.707,2.837
with that in all of those venues.,2813.544,4.204
"And then again, I guess, the only way to say this",2817.748,2.669
"is, then obviously on the dual-track side we have",2820.417,2.069
the additional executive order that we&amp;#39;ve talked,2822.486,2.903
about earlier that will come out and further,2825.389,2.068
address the problems.,2827.457,1.836
We continue to believe that the issues that we,2829.293,3.904
face specifically in the 9th district -- 9th,2833.197,2.936
"Circuit, rather, that we will prevail on, on the",2836.133,2.269
merits of that.,2838.402,1.067
But on the other challenges that have come,2839.469,1.402
and the other venues and the others -- that we feel,2840.871,2.169
"equally confident, as we did in Massachusetts",2843.04,1.868
and other venues.,2844.908,0.734
So it&amp;#39;s not a single-track system.,2845.642,2.803
"And I&amp;#39;m sorry, I know you --",2848.445,0.901
The Press: Have you made a decision yet about,2849.346,1.201
the Supreme Court taking it there?,2850.547,1.602
And then the other question was on the safe,2852.149,1.234
zones and the timeline.,2853.383,1.035
Mr. Spicer: So with respect to the Supreme,2854.418,2.068
"Court, I mean, we&amp;#39;ve got to continue to work this",2856.486,1.402
through the process.,2857.888,1.868
So right now it&amp;#39;s at the 9th Circuit.,2859.756,1.702
That&amp;#39;s the primary problem that we are addressing.,2861.458,1.401
And then we don&amp;#39;t have any timeline that I can,2862.859,4.338
announce today on Syrian safe zones.,2867.197,2.269
The Press: I just want to follow up to this,2869.466,2.336
morning&amp;#39;s meeting.,2871.802,2.068
And the President said that he gave authorization,2873.87,3.571
to a couple of countries to buy military equipment,2877.441,2.269
from the United States.,2879.71,1.601
Which countries was he referring to?,2881.311,1.669
And has he gone to Congress to ask for,2882.98,1.801
permission to do this?,2884.781,1.635
Mr. Spicer: We&amp;#39;ll follow up and get a,2886.416,1.302
list for you on that. Jeff.,2887.718,3.136
"The Press: Sean, if I could ask again about the",2890.854,1.235
delay of the executive order until the next week.,2892.089,3.603
Is the administration still trying to craft its,2895.692,2.102
"legal argument to this to withstand scrutiny, or",2897.794,4.038
why again the delay?,2901.832,1.268
I&amp;#39;m not sure I understand --,2903.1,1.334
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, and I",2904.434,0.601
think I asked and answered this earlier.,2905.035,1.902
"The Press: Sorry, I don&amp;#39;t understand the delay.",2906.937,0.701
"Mr. Spicer: Okay, then I&amp;#39;ll explain it to you.",2907.638,3.703
I think the President this time -- we were very,2911.341,3.537
careful to understand what the court&amp;#39;s concerns were,2914.878,3.303
and address them in the follow-up executive order.,2918.181,2.203
"With respect to when we&amp;#39;re going to announce it, part",2920.384,4.004
of this is to make sure that we work with the,2924.388,1.635
appropriate departments and agencies on the,2926.023,1.001
implementation of it to make sure that it is,2927.024,2.869
executed and it continues to be executed in a,2929.893,1.402
"flawless manner, and that it meets the intent that",2931.295,2.068
it would serve.,2933.363,1.135
"We understand the challenges that may come,",2934.498,3.103
and so we want to do this in a manner that makes,2937.601,2.069
"sure that the Hill, other members of Congress, the",2939.67,3.903
appropriate agencies and departments are fully,2943.573,2.67
ready to implement this when it&amp;#39;s issued.,2946.243,4.037
And so that&amp;#39;s it.,2950.28,1.135
There&amp;#39;s really nothing more to it.,2951.415,0.934
The Press: There also is some concern -- if I can,2952.349,1.301
follow up -- there also is concern inside the Justice,2953.65,2.102
Department and in Homeland Security by some officials,2955.752,3.07
this afternoon that we&amp;#39;re reporting that the White,2958.822,3.27
House is looking for them to help build this legal,2962.092,3.971
"argument, to find a conclusion here.",2966.063,1.401
"Mr. Spicer: No, that&amp;#39;s not -- basically, you&amp;#39;re",2967.464,2.135
saying that we did our due diligence.,2969.599,1.869
We looked to the departments to ask them to,2971.468,2.636
review certain things.,2974.104,1.401
"So last week it was we rushed stuff; this week,",2975.505,2.403
you&amp;#39;re saying that we are taking our time and --,2977.908,2.269
The Press: Has it been more difficult than you,2980.177,0.6
thought it would be?,2980.777,0.467
"Mr. Spicer: No, that&amp;#39;s not true.",2981.244,1.135
I don&amp;#39;t think so.,2982.379,0.834
And I think you using continued unnamed sources,2983.213,2.97
-- I think it actually is a -- it will be,2986.183,2.269
implemented flawlessly because we&amp;#39;ve done the,2988.452,3.203
"right thing and gone to these individuals, sought",2991.655,1.935
"feedback and guidance, and done this in an",2993.59,4.872
unbelievably comprehensive way to ensure that,2998.462,2.068
departments and agencies that are going to be,3000.53,1.769
executing and implementing this fully are aware of,3002.299,3.303
what&amp;#39;s happening.,3005.602,0.901
"But this has been done in a very, very",3006.503,3.303
comprehensive way.,3009.806,3.971
"Yeah, sorry.",3013.777,0.5
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",3014.277,0.568
"Melanie Arter, CNSNews.com.",3014.845,0.867
Former Labor Secretary nominee Andrew Puzder,3015.712,1.268
admitted that for a few years he unwittingly,3016.98,2.336
employed an illegal immigrant as,3019.316,2.135
a housekeeper.,3021.451,1.602
Is this administration committed to holding,3023.053,2.436
employers accountable when they employ,3025.489,2.335
illegal aliens?,3027.824,0.968
And how does the administration,3028.792,1.301
plan to do so?,3030.093,1.201
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, I think that was -- that issue was",3031.294,1.769
something that Mr. Puzder was very forthcoming on.,3033.063,4.104
And when he recognized the situation that had,3037.167,2.936
"occurred, he paid all the appropriate taxes and",3040.103,2.169
tried to help the individual go through the,3042.272,1.735
proper process.,3044.007,1.068
"And so, yeah, we&amp;#39;re going to continue to make sure",3045.075,3.27
that we hold individuals in compliance,3048.345,3.07
with the law.,3051.415,0.6
"And he did the right thing then, but whether it&amp;#39;s",3052.015,2.636
"companies or individuals, I think, we are committed",3054.651,3.337
to making sure that people do what&amp;#39;s right.,3057.988,1.468
"Yes, ma&amp;#39;am.",3059.456,0.767
"The Press: Veronica Clearly, with Fox 5.",3060.223,2.203
I have two questions.,3062.426,1.234
Janet Evancho -- she sang the National Anthem -- she,3063.66,2.469
requested a meeting with the President.,3066.129,2.336
Her sister is transgender.,3068.465,2.202
"Is he going to take that meeting, or meet with",3070.667,1.568
anyone from the transgender community,3072.235,1.769
during this conversation?,3074.004,1.334
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, I think the President would be",3075.338,0.835
welcome to meet with her.,3076.173,2.135
The Press: The second question --,3078.308,0.601
second question.,3078.909,1.301
Steve Bannon today called the media the,3080.21,2.369
opposition party.,3082.579,0.667
"Last week, there was lots of conversation about the",3083.246,1.535
fake news and us being the enemy of the people.,3084.781,3.203
Some have said that this is really just a branding,3087.984,2.436
"of the media, where he did that in the primaries,",3090.42,3.837
branding &amp;quot;Little Marco&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Lyin&amp;#39; Ted&amp;quot;. Is this --,3094.257,2.736
"Mr. Spicer: Well, no, that was",3096.993,0.868
the President. Just to --,3097.861,0.867
"The Press: Right, of course.",3098.728,0.701
But is this a branding strategy to --,3099.429,1.702
"Mr. Spicer: No, I think that&amp;#39;s what",3101.131,0.967
Steve believes.,3102.098,1.302
The Press: But this is real.,3103.4,0.634
"Mr. Spicer: Absolutely, of course, it&amp;#39;s real.",3104.034,1.168
I don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;d go out -- Steve has been very,3105.202,1.701
clear about his position on the media and how he,3106.903,2.236
believes it distorts things.,3109.139,1.435
So I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s --,3110.574,0.634
The Press: From the whole administration?,3111.208,1.501
"Mr. Spicer: No, no.",3112.709,0.534
Hold on.,3113.243,0.567
I just said that that is what Steve&amp;#39;s view is.,3113.81,5.439
"He&amp;#39;s made it several times, and I think he&amp;#39;s",3119.249,1.468
very clear on that.,3120.717,1.401
Sarah.,3122.118,1.035
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",3123.153,0.567
Back to the border adjustment tax.,3123.72,2.136
President Trump has told Reuters that he does,3125.856,1.801
support some form of a border tax.,3127.657,3.07
How does the President respond to critics that,3130.727,2.87
are saying the border adjustment tax will be,3133.597,2.502
passed on to lower-income and middle-class families,3136.099,3.036
in the form of higher prices for goods and,3139.135,1.635
higher prices for gas?,3140.77,1.736
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think if you look at",3142.506,1.067
"holistically -- I mean, the first thing to",3143.573,1.368
understand is that there is no tax if you&amp;#39;re,3144.941,1.869
"manufacturing in the United States, so there",3146.81,2.936
can be no higher cost.,3149.746,2.069
"But if you think about it right now, we have to look",3151.815,2.269
"at this in a holistic way, which is, when a company",3154.084,3.57
chooses to leave our country and shed American,3157.654,3.036
"jobs so they can move overseas, and then sell",3160.69,2.736
"back to us at a lower price, there&amp;#39;s a big cost",3163.426,4.205
that comes to our economy and to our workers.,3167.631,2.702
And so we&amp;#39;ve got to look at this comprehensively.,3170.333,1.502
But if a company chooses to stay and grow in the,3171.835,2.569
"United States, hire more people, it actually will",3174.404,2.703
"be a net savings, if you think about it, because it",3177.107,1.768
"will be the companies who are overseas, who have",3178.875,2.97
chosen to move out of the country who will face a,3181.845,2.069
higher cost under these kind of plans.,3183.914,3.203
And that&amp;#39;s a big difference.,3187.117,1.535
"It will actually benefit consumers, benefit",3188.652,1.701
"workers, and benefit out economy.",3190.353,2.002
And that&amp;#39;s -- when you really think about the,3192.355,1.635
"economic impact about that, that benefits our",3193.99,2.336
"economy, it helps our American workers, it grows",3196.326,2.703
"more jobs, it grows the manufacturing base.",3199.029,2.702
"And again, we are probably one of only a handful of",3201.731,3.604
developed countries that don&amp;#39;t have a tax system,3205.335,2.569
that looks at this.,3207.904,1.435
"And so right now, it&amp;#39;s America and American",3209.339,2.636
workers and American manufacturing that are the,3211.975,2.469
disadvantage of the current regulatory and tax,3214.444,1.502
"system, not the other way around.",3215.946,1.534
"Thank you, guys.",3217.48,0.835
Have a great day.,3218.315,1.935
