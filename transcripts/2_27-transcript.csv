"Mr Spicer: Wow, that&amp;#39;s a crowd.",1.534,3.137
I hope everyone had a great weekend.,4.671,3.704
Good afternoon.,8.375,0.7
"Before I begin, I wanted to introduce the Director",9.075,2.436
"of the Office of Management and Budget,",11.511,2.069
"Mick Mulvaney, to talk to you a bit about the",13.58,1.835
President&amp;#39;s budget.,15.415,1.401
"When Director Mulvaney is finished, we will allow",16.816,4.538
him to take a few questions and then resume,21.354,4.204
the briefing and all the fun that goes with it.,25.558,0.701
"So without any further ado, Director Mulvaney.",26.259,4.671
Direcotr Mulvaney: Thanks very much.,30.93,0.501
I want to talk for a few minutes about the budget,31.431,1.435
blueprint that most of you know the President,32.866,2.836
started speaking about this morning with,35.702,1.401
the governors.,37.103,0.701
I&amp;#39;ll talk a little bit about what it is and what,37.804,2.669
"it isn&amp;#39;t, and then talk about where we are in the",40.473,2.102
budget process and what it looks like from here.,42.575,2.57
"First of all, what this isn&amp;#39;t: This is not a",45.145,1.801
full-blown budget.,46.946,1.635
That will not come until May.,48.581,1.268
So you&amp;#39;re not going to see anything in here that has,49.849,2.236
"to do with mandatory spending, entitlement",52.085,1.935
"reforms, tax policies, revenue projections, or",54.02,3.103
the infrastructure plan.,57.123,1.268
"This blueprint was never going to be that, as I",58.391,1.702
made clear during my Senate confirmation.,60.093,1.668
It is a topline number only.,61.761,2.703
"As for what it is, these are the President&amp;#39;s",64.464,3.17
"policies, as reflected in topline",67.634,2.903
discretionary spending.,70.537,1.234
"To that end, it is a true America-first budget.",71.771,2.336
It will show the President is keeping his promises,74.107,1.968
and doing exactly what he said he was going to do,76.075,1.736
when he ran for office.,77.811,1.768
"It prioritizes rebuilding the military, including",79.579,2.502
restoring our nuclear capabilities; protecting,82.081,2.536
the nation and securing the border; enforcing the,84.617,2.469
laws currently on the books; taking care of,87.086,2.436
vets; and increasing school choice.,89.522,1.735
And it does all of that without adding to the,91.257,2.503
currently projected FY 2018 deficit.,93.76,4.604
The top line defense discretionary number is,98.364,2.236
$603 billion.,100.6,1.335
That&amp;#39;s a $54-billion increase -- it&amp;#39;s one of,101.935,2.969
the largest increases in history.,104.904,2.102
It&amp;#39;s also the number that allows the President to,107.006,1.969
keep his promise to undo the military sequester.,108.975,3.27
The topline nondefense number will be,112.245,1.635
$462 billion.,113.88,1.535
That&amp;#39;s a $54-billion savings.,115.415,2.969
It&amp;#39;s the largest-proposed reduction since the early,118.384,2.236
years of the Reagan administration.,120.62,2.202
The reductions in nondefense spending follow,122.822,2.102
the same model -- it&amp;#39;s the President keeping his,124.924,1.802
promises and doing exactly what he said he,126.726,2.035
was going to do.,128.761,1.535
"It reduces money that we give to other nations, it",130.296,2.236
"reduces duplicative programs, and it",132.532,2.135
eliminates programs that simply don&amp;#39;t work.,134.667,2.503
The bottom line is this: The President is going to,137.17,1.435
protect the country and do so in exactly the same way,138.605,2.969
that every American family has had to do over the,141.574,2.303
"last couple years, and that&amp;#39;s",143.877,0.867
prioritize spending.,144.744,1.802
The schedule from here -- these numbers will go out,146.546,2.202
to the agencies today in a process that we,148.748,1.869
describe as passback.,150.617,2.035
Review from agencies are due back to OMB over the,152.652,2.169
"course of the next couple days, and we&amp;#39;ll spend the",154.821,1.635
next week or so working on a final budget blueprint.,156.456,3.87
We expect to have that number to Congress,160.326,3.904
by March 16th.,164.23,1.702
That puts us on schedule for a full budget --,165.932,2.569
"including all the things I mentioned, this one does",168.501,1.335
not include -- with all the larger policy issues,169.836,3.503
in the first part of May.,173.339,2.403
"So with that, I&amp;#39;ll take a couple questions.",175.742,1.501
"Yes, sir.",177.243,0.701
"The Press: Mr. Director, in order to get to your",177.944,1.535
topline on the rest of the nondiscretionary -- or,179.479,2.803
"rest of the discretionary budget, if you&amp;#39;re not",182.282,1.735
"going to touch veterans benefits, you need to",184.017,2.536
slice about 12 percent off of the rest of government.,186.553,2.669
Can&amp;#39;t you do that without affecting the services the,189.222,3.203
government provides for --,192.425,1.101
DIrector Mulvaney: And that&amp;#39;s part of what this,193.526,1.335
process is this week.,194.861,1.568
"The numbers go out, and the numbers -- each agency",196.429,2.636
will get its topline number along with,199.065,1.969
recommendations from OMB as to how we think they,201.034,2.035
can hit that number.,203.069,0.701
"And they may come back to us and say, yeah, we think",203.77,1.535
"that&amp;#39;s a good way to reach that number, or they may",205.305,1.768
come back to us with other suggestions.,207.073,2.669
That&amp;#39;s what this process is.,209.742,1.135
I think it&amp;#39;s fairly unusual for us to be,210.877,1.802
"coming to you this early in the process, but we",212.679,2.302
wanted to let everybody know exactly,214.981,1.335
where we were.,216.316,0.667
The Press: But we&amp;#39;re not talking about 2 or 3,216.983,1.735
percent -- we&amp;#39;re talking about double-digit,218.718,1.335
"reductions, and that&amp;#39;s a lot.",220.053,0.734
Director Mulvaney: There&amp;#39;s going to be a lot of,220.787,1.368
"programs that -- again, you can expect to see",222.155,2.302
exactly what the President said he was going to do.,224.457,2.569
"Foreign aid, for example -- the President said",227.026,1.735
we&amp;#39;re going to spend less money overseas and spend,228.761,1.669
more of it here.,230.43,0.667
That&amp;#39;s going to be reflected in the number we,231.097,1.668
send to the State Department.,232.765,0.801
The Press: Thank you very much.,233.566,1.235
One quick follow on foreign aid.,234.801,1.902
That accounts for less than 1 percent of,236.703,2.535
overall spending.,239.238,0.668
And I just spoke with an analyst who said even if,239.906,3.036
"you zero that out, it wouldn&amp;#39;t pay for one year",242.942,2.936
of the budget increases that are being,245.878,2.002
proposed right now.,247.88,0.835
So how do you square that amount?,248.715,2.002
"So why not tackle entitlements, which are",250.717,2.002
"the biggest driver, especially when a lot of",252.719,1.635
Republicans over the years have said that they need,254.354,1.968
to be taxed?,256.322,0.668
Director Mulvaney: Sure.,256.99,0.667
"On your foreign aid, it&amp;#39;s the same answer I just",257.657,1.868
"gave, which is, yes, it&amp;#39;s a fairly part of the",259.525,2.737
"discretionary budget, but it&amp;#39;s still consistent with",262.262,2.402
what the President said.,264.664,0.834
"When you see these reductions, you&amp;#39;ll be able",265.498,2.169
to tie it back to a speech the President gave or,267.667,1.668
something the President has said previously.,269.335,1.869
He&amp;#39;s simply going to -- we are taking his words and,271.204,2.402
turning them into policies and dollars.,273.606,3.27
So we will be spending less overseas and spending,276.876,2.069
more back home.,278.945,1.768
I forgot your second question.,280.713,1.101
"The Press: O entitlements, why not",281.814,1.702
"address entitlements, which is the biggest",283.516,1.802
driver of spending?,285.318,0.701
Director Mulvaney: It&amp;#39;s very unusual to -- this is,286.019,2.035
a budget blueprint -- what some folks used to call a,288.054,2.502
skinny budget -- and it would not be at all,290.556,1.635
"unusual for larger policy decisions, including tax",292.191,3.471
"reform, revenue projections not to be",295.662,1.835
included in this budget.,297.497,0.867
That will come in -- The Press: Down the line?,298.364,1.935
The Press: Sir -- The Press: Hold on.,300.299,1.335
"So down the line, could we see some type of budget",301.634,1.335
that deals with entitlements?,302.969,0.667
Director Mulvaney: The full budget will contain,303.636,1.368
the entire spectrum of the President&amp;#39;s proposed,305.004,2.836
policy changes.,307.84,0.701
"The Press: Director, on rebuilding the military,",308.541,1.668
can you talk a little bit about more of the,310.209,1.769
breakdown of that?,311.978,1.168
Can you go into a little bit more detail?,313.146,3.236
"Director Mulvaney: No, I can&amp;#39;t -- because, again,",316.382,2.77
where we are in this process is that the,319.152,1.334
numbers going to the DOD today and over the course,320.486,1.635
"of the next 10 days to two weeks, we&amp;#39;ll be coming up",322.121,1.335
with those types of details.,323.456,0.667
I&amp;#39;ve got time for one more.,324.123,1.135
The Press: Will you be asking the military --,325.258,2.836
"you&amp;#39;re going to increase the military budget, but",328.094,1.635
are you going to at least ask the people in the,329.729,2.502
Defense Department to take a look at their budget and,332.231,1.602
"say, hey, where can we at least cut or at least look",333.833,2.803
and make sure that we&amp;#39;re spending the right amount,336.636,1.368
of money?,338.004,0.667
Is part of that is going to be part of the process?,338.671,1.335
"Director Mulvaney: Well, absolutely.",340.006,1.334
That&amp;#39;s part of what Secretary Mattis and I,341.34,1.335
have already talked.,342.675,0.667
He&amp;#39;s interested in driving more efficiencies into the,343.342,1.335
Defense Department.,344.677,0.667
OMB is also going to be involved with him on the,345.344,1.369
procurement process.,346.713,0.667
All of that will be incorporated in our larger,347.38,1.335
budget in May.,348.715,0.667
The Press: So it&amp;#39;s not just like a blanket --,349.382,1.335
"&amp;quot;Here, we&amp;#39;re going to throw money at you, do",350.717,1.334
what you want&amp;quot;?,352.051,1.235
"Director Mulvaney: No, sir.",353.286,1.635
"No, sir.",354.921,0.834
Last one.,355.755,0.801
The Press: Does this account for spending for,356.556,3.436
"the President&amp;#39;s wall, either in the $30 billion",359.992,2.269
we&amp;#39;ve heard you&amp;#39;re going to request for this year,362.261,2.303
or the $54 billion increase?,364.564,1.168
"Does that include money for the wall, how to pay",365.732,2.369
for the wall?,368.101,0.734
Director Mulvaney: I would be more likely --,368.835,1.902
"excuse me, a little bit of both.",370.737,1.735
We do expect to include some money in a future,372.472,2.335
"supplemental for 2017 for the wall, and a 2018",374.807,3.137
budget will also contain some longer-term dollars,377.944,2.235
for that.,380.179,2.002
The Press: So it will be split up between the two.,382.181,1.335
Director Mulvaney: I believe that to,383.516,1.335
be the case.,384.851,0.667
Thank you all very much.,385.518,0.667
"Mr Spicer: Thank you, Director.",386.185,1.068
So let me get back to -- I&amp;#39;ll be right there in,387.253,3.37
"a second, April.",390.623,2.002
"This morning, the President dropped by the",392.625,2.236
"National Governors Association meeting, where",394.861,2.235
49 governors from both states and territories,397.096,2.636
joined Cabinet members and senior White House staff,399.732,2.169
to discuss where they can work together to rebuild,401.901,2.236
the country and restart the economy.,404.137,2.268
"While at the meeting, the President delivered a",406.405,1.335
statement on his forthcoming budget,407.74,1.368
"proposal, which he&amp;#39;ll submit March 16th, as you",409.108,2.87
just heard the Director mention.,411.978,1.568
"The President&amp;#39;s budget will, first and foremost,",413.546,1.702
keep Americans safe.,415.248,1.334
That means investing in both our nation&amp;#39;s physical,416.582,2.57
and financial security.,419.152,1.635
We will rebuild the nation&amp;#39;s military.,420.787,2.569
"An increase in defense spending, including",423.356,1.802
"increased funding for our veterans and our border,",425.158,2.135
will be matched by equal reductions in,427.293,2.336
nondefense programs.,429.629,1.101
The savings in our budget will come from looking at,430.73,2.135
outdated and duplicative programs.,432.865,2.136
The reductions spending will be sensible and,435.001,2.536
"rational, but they will also be tough.",437.537,2.902
"With our nation&amp;#39;s debt spiraling out of control,",440.439,2.937
we simply must take a look at the way we&amp;#39;re spending,443.376,1.968
taxpayers&amp;#39; dollars.,445.344,1.502
Families across the country are being forced,446.846,1.568
"to make difficult choices, because for too long the",448.414,2.202
federal government has not treated their money with,450.616,2.136
the respect they deserve.,452.752,1.868
The national debt exploded under the last,454.62,1.802
administration from $10.6 billion [trillion] on,456.422,3.237
"January 20th, 2009 to $19.9 trillion the day",459.659,4.771
"before -- sorry, those are both trillions -- the day",464.43,2.636
before the President&amp;#39;s -- President,467.066,1.769
Trump&amp;#39;s inaugural.,468.835,1.201
Every child born in America this year will,470.036,1.868
"inherit an average of over $60,000 in debt.",471.904,3.103
"And that, frankly, is too much.",475.007,1.969
Our budget will restore respect for taxpayers&amp;#39;,476.976,2.402
dollars while funding all the necessary programs to,479.378,3.037
keep our country safe and prospering.,482.415,2.636
This meeting with the governors was a,485.051,1.334
continuation of a weekend of engagement and,486.385,2.002
discussion between the governors and,488.387,1.869
the administration.,490.256,1.234
The President and the First Lady welcomed the,491.49,1.435
governors last night to the White House for the,492.925,2.002
Annual Governors Ball.,494.927,1.368
"And yesterday, the Vice President had a very",496.295,1.669
productive meeting with several governors.,497.964,1.902
The administration is proud to be working with,499.866,1.701
the governors on rebuilding our nation&amp;#39;s,501.567,1.769
"infrastructure, reforming our healthcare system, and",503.336,2.969
putting Americans back to work.,506.305,1.835
"I know that Obamacare, in particular, was put into",508.14,1.802
place without a lot of input from governors.,509.942,1.869
We&amp;#39;re committed to consulting and including,511.811,1.968
them on this and so many other subjects as we solve,513.779,3.003
the nation&amp;#39;s biggest issues together.,516.782,2.069
"Later this morning, the President had a listening",518.851,1.735
session with some of our country&amp;#39;s leading,520.586,1.902
healthcare insurance companies.,522.488,2.169
"Interestingly, on yesterday&amp;#39;s ABC &amp;quot;This",524.657,2.069
"Week,&amp;quot; Minority Leader Pelosi actually laid out a",526.726,2.369
great outline of how to judge Obamacare&amp;#39;s success,529.095,3.069
based on what it was supposed to achieve.,532.164,1.869
"She said, &amp;quot;It had three goals: One, to lower the",534.033,2.936
"cost, the other to expand benefits, and the third to",536.969,3.437
improve and increase access.&amp;quot; So let&amp;#39;s go,540.406,3.437
through her criteria.,543.843,1.468
Lowering costs: While this year all four tiers of,545.311,3.37
Obamacare insurance plans are facing double-digit,548.681,2.603
increases in average premiums.,551.284,1.968
"Just to take a look at one set of premiums, for",553.252,2.636
"standard silver plans in the states, 63 percent",555.888,2.603
"increase in Tennessee, 69 percent increase in",558.491,2.736
"Oklahoma, and a staggering 116 percent",561.227,3.27
increase in Arizona.,564.497,1.802
"On expanding benefits: In reality, the new law&amp;#39;s",566.299,2.435
"mandates have led to max cancellations of coverage,",568.734,3.17
"soaring out-of-pocket costs, and declining",571.904,2.536
enrollment figures.,574.44,0.834
Millions are choosing to pay a tax over buying the,575.274,3.07
government-mandate insurance.,578.344,2.035
Increased access: With insurance fleeing the,580.379,2.136
"marketplace, Americans are facing a dwindling number",582.515,2.903
of insurance choices with 17 percent of Americans,585.418,2.836
left with only one insurer option available,588.254,2.569
in their exchange.,590.823,1.535
Insurers will be indispensable partners in,592.358,2.102
the transition period out of Obamacare into the,594.46,2.636
Patients First plan the President will be working,597.096,2.069
with Congress to put in its place.,599.165,1.868
"The President&amp;#39;s plan will encourage innovation,",601.033,2.169
"modernize our healthcare system, and provide",603.202,1.869
"immediate relief, and ensure access to quality,",605.071,2.435
truly affordable care.,607.506,1.936
"This afternoon, the President had lunch with",609.442,1.434
Vice President Pence and Ambassador Haley.,610.876,2.536
"Afterwards, he&amp;#39;s having a meeting with Speaker Ryan",613.412,1.902
and Majority Leader McConnell.,615.314,2.67
"And then following that, he&amp;#39;s going to be meeting",617.984,1.501
with Secretary of State Tillerson.,619.485,1.768
The Secretary is coming off a very successful trip,621.253,1.969
to Mexico that -- he was joined by Secretary of,623.222,2.97
Homeland Security Kelly.,626.192,1.001
I&amp;#39;m sure the President is looking forward to,627.193,2.869
discussing that trip with the Secretary.,630.062,1.602
"Also this afternoon, the Vice President will be",631.664,1.535
speaking to an extraordinary group of 60,633.199,1.701
presidents of Historically Black Colleges,634.9,1.735

"There will be a pool spray at the top of the event,",637.303,2.102
and the Vice President&amp;#39;s office will release his,639.405,2.135
remarks and photos following the event.,641.54,2.136
We can also expect a meeting with the President,643.676,3.27
with them as well.,646.946,1.168
"This evening, the President will have dinner",648.114,2.102
with regional press affiliates that are going,650.216,1.334
to be in town for the joint session of Congress.,651.55,2.436
While it&amp;#39;s tradition for representatives from the,653.986,1.802
networks to meet with the President before his joint,655.788,1.635
"address, this is the first time, to my knowledge at",657.423,3.17
"least, that the opportunity has been",660.593,1.935
expanded to include representation from 18,662.528,1.902
regional outlets from around the country.,664.43,2.002
"Tomorrow, the President will also have the",666.432,1.535
traditional lunch with the network anchors.,667.967,2.002
"Beyond the so-called &amp;quot;big five&amp;quot; networks, we&amp;#39;ve also",669.969,2.235
opened it up and invited outlets including,672.204,1.669
"Telemundo, Univision, CBN, EWTN, OANN, PBS, C-SPAN,",673.873,5.272
and TV1.,679.145,1.434
"Tonight, the President looks forward to seeing",680.579,1.602
"his nominee for the Secretary of Commerce,",682.181,2.169
"Wilbur Ross, confirmed by the Senate.",684.35,1.968
Secretary-designate Ross has been an important,686.318,2.169
champion for U.S.-struggling industries,688.487,1.835
in the private sectors.,690.322,1.302
"And pending his confirmation this evening,",691.624,1.835
he&amp;#39;ll now do in the same post on behalf of the,693.459,1.768
American people what he has done in,695.227,1.936
private sector.,697.163,1.134
Assuming everything goes according to the plan in,698.297,2.002
"the Senate tonight, we expect to have his",700.299,1.802
swearing-in tomorrow here at the White House.,702.101,2.703
"Also tomorrow, the President will deliver his",704.804,1.568
first address to both houses of Congress.,706.372,2.402
"In his speech, the President will lay out an",708.774,1.535
"optimistic vision for the country, crossing",710.309,2.302
"traditional lines of party, race,",712.611,1.602
socioeconomic status.,714.213,1.969
"As I said before, the theme will be the renewal",716.182,2.002
of the American spirit.,718.184,1.701
He will invite Americans of all backgrounds to come,719.885,2.002
together in the service of a stronger and brighter,721.887,2.002
future for our nation.,723.889,2.203
In addition to laying out the concrete steps the,726.092,2.335
President has already taken to make the American,728.427,1.669
"Dream possible for all of our people, he will talk",730.096,3.003
about the bold agenda -- he wants to,733.099,1.334
work with Congress.,734.433,1.235
This includes tax and regulatory reform to,735.668,2.803
provide relief to hardworking Americans and,738.471,2.335
"their businesses, making the workplace better for",740.806,2.77
"working parents, ensuring the families who have",743.576,2.736
suffered under Obamacare&amp;#39;s skyrocketing rates see it,746.312,2.969
replaced with a patient-centered,749.281,1.435
"alternative, making sure every child in America has",750.716,2.703
"access to a good education, a rebuilding of",753.419,2.502
our military and fulfilling of our,755.921,1.602
commitments to veterans to whom we obviously owe a,757.523,2.703
great deal of gratitude.,760.226,1.568
You can expect to see a speech grounded firmly in,761.794,2.502
solving real problems for every American -- how can,764.296,3.037
we make sure that every American who needs a,767.333,1.368
"better job get one, how can we get kids who are",768.701,2.402
"trapped in failing schools into better ones, how we",771.103,2.436
can keep gangs and drug violence out of our,773.539,2.336
neighborhoods and communities.,775.875,1.534
The President will address the Americans who have,777.409,1.769
been waiting for help from their leaders for too,779.178,1.601
"long, and let them know that help is",780.779,1.769
finally on the way.,782.548,1.468
"With respect to the speech, we will be having",784.016,1.568
a background briefing sometime this evening here,785.584,2.136
in the briefing room.,787.72,0.734
We will provide additional details later,788.454,2.769
in the afternoon.,791.223,1.035
"As you might already know, the Department of Defense",792.258,1.801
presented its preliminary plan to the White House,794.059,2.236
today to defeat ISIS.,796.295,1.134
This plan has been delivered by Secretary,797.429,2.47
"Mattis, who is currently briefing the principals on",799.899,2.769
the option presented today in seeking their,802.668,2.302
input and feedback.,804.97,1.835
"Finally, I wanted to note the President continues to",806.805,1.736
be deeply disappointed and concerned by the reports,808.541,2.936
of further vandalism at Jewish community -- Jewish,811.477,3.37
"cemeteries, rather.",814.847,0.867
The cowardly destruction in Philadelphia this,815.714,2.536
weekend comes on top of similar accounts from,818.25,2.136
Missouri and threats made to Jewish community,820.386,2.169
centers around the country.,822.555,1.401
The President continues to condemn these and any,823.956,2.502
other form of anti-Semitic and hateful acts in the,826.458,2.737
strongest terms.,829.195,1.401
"From our country&amp;#39;s founding, we&amp;#39;ve been",830.596,1.768
dedicated to protecting the freedom of our,832.364,1.569
citizens&amp;#39; rights to worship.,833.933,1.801
No one in America should feel afraid to follow the,835.734,2.169
religion of their choosing freely and openly.,837.903,3.17
The President is dedicated to preserving this,841.073,1.702
originating principle of our nation.,842.775,2.135
"And while we&amp;#39;re at it, I don&amp;#39;t want to get ahead of",844.91,1.335
"the law enforcement, but I was asked the other day",846.245,2.202
about the story in Kansas -- the shooting in Kansas.,848.447,3.403
"And while the story is evolving, early reports",851.85,2.636
out of Kansas are equally disturbing.,854.486,2.236
"So with that, I&amp;#39;ll be glad to take your questions. Jon.",856.722,2.369
"The Press: Sean, there&amp;#39;s a report this morning that",859.091,3.237
you reached out directly to CIA Director Pompeo.,862.328,5.272
Did you directly contact Director Pompeo and ask,867.6,2.602
him to knock down the New York Times story on the,870.202,2.403
Russia connection?,872.605,0.667
"Mr Spicer: Thanks, Jon.",873.272,0.701
"Let me kind of, if I may, walk through the",873.973,2.669
entire timeline.,876.642,0.667
I think it&amp;#39;s important.,877.309,0.768
"As I mentioned I think a week ago, the New York",878.077,2.869
Times published a story about what they called,880.946,1.902
&amp;quot;contacts&amp;quot; between members of the Trump campaign and,882.848,3.404
Russian officials.,886.252,2.002
The FBI deputy director was at a meeting here at,888.254,2.268
the White House that morning.,890.522,1.535
"After the meeting concluded, he asked the",892.057,2.636
"chief of staff to stand back a second, he wanted",894.693,1.702
to tell him that the report in the New York,896.395,2.803
Times was &amp;quot;BS.&amp;quot;,899.198,2.169
"For viewers at home, I think you can pretty much",901.367,1.902
"figure what that means, but I&amp;#39;ll leave it at that.",903.269,2.602
"At that time, the chief of staff said, thank you for",905.871,2.202
"sharing that with me, can we let other people know",908.073,2.67
that the story is not accurate.,910.743,1.868
"Throughout the day, they went back and forth to see",912.611,1.702
what they thought was appropriate.,914.313,1.435
"Finally, came to the conclusion that they did",915.748,3.436
not want to get in the process of knocking down,919.184,2.169
every story that they had issues with.,921.353,2.636
They then -- we then were informed that other people,923.989,2.569
"had come to the same conclusions, including --",926.558,2.169
"at that time, Chairman Devin Nunes had told us,",928.727,2.403
"hey, I&amp;#39;ve been knocking this down,",931.13,1.334
telling reporters.,932.464,1.435
We shared a number with him of a reporter that had,933.899,3.771
contacted us.,937.67,1.334
"And again, when the reporters contact us and",939.004,1.935
"we said, no, that&amp;#39;s not -- to the best of our",940.939,1.335
"knowledge that&amp;#39;s not true, they were asking us, can",942.274,2.269
you point to -anybody else that can,944.543,2.169
substantiate this?,946.712,1.535
"And I think we did a good job of saying, sure, we",948.247,2.969
will share with reporters other people who have come,951.216,2.403
to the same conclusion.,953.619,1.435
So I won&amp;#39;t go into the specifics.,955.054,1.568
I will say that I think we did our job very,956.622,2.803
effectively by making sure that reporters who had had,959.425,2.869
questions about the accuracy and the claims,962.294,2.87
"made in The New York Times, that we were",965.164,1.902
pointing them to subject-matter experts who,967.066,2.502
understood whether or not that story was,969.568,2.236
accurate or not.,971.804,1.201
"And I think just to continue to be very, very",973.005,1.868
clear on this -- it was about the accuracy of the,974.873,4.271
"reporting and the claims that were made in there,",979.144,2.236
plain and simple -- about whether or not a story,981.38,1.835
that appeared in The New York Times was accurate.,983.215,2.069
And individual after individual continued to,985.284,1.868
"say that, as far as they knew, they weren&amp;#39;t.",987.152,2.136
I think most of you probably saw Chairman,989.288,2.102
Nunes&amp;#39;s comments this morning.,991.39,1.802
"He was very clear, number one, that he reached out",993.192,2.836
"to us to say, I&amp;#39;ve been telling people, reporters,",996.028,4.071
that these allegations and descriptions in The New,1000.099,2.836
York Times are not accurate.,1002.935,1.735
And then we shared that information with him.,1004.67,1.935
But he came to us to share that he equally had that,1006.605,3.604
"issue brought up to him, he was briefed and saw &amp;quot;no",1010.209,3.136
evidence&amp;quot; that the story was accurate.,1013.345,1.802
"So the answer is, we have continued to give",1015.147,5.839
reporters information and sources that went to the,1020.986,4.238
"accuracy, or lack thereof, of a report that",1025.224,2.469
was in a newspaper.,1027.693,0.701
And I think Chairman Nunes also equally said it&amp;#39;s,1028.394,4.237
interesting how we literally were engaging,1032.631,2.736
"with the press, saying, if you have a question about",1035.367,2.036
"the sourcing on this -- obviously, when brought to",1037.403,2.369
"our attention, we said, it&amp;#39;s not accurate as we",1039.772,2.702
"know, but then most of you and your colleagues who",1042.474,2.77
"had inquired would say, well, that&amp;#39;s great, I&amp;#39;m",1045.244,2.002
"sure you&amp;#39;re saying this, but who else can",1047.246,1.334
corroborate this?,1048.58,1.268
So our job was to continue to -- when informed --,1049.848,3.337
share sources who had equally come to the same,1053.185,3.07
conclusion that the Times story was not accurate.,1056.255,2.169
The Press: You don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s something strange,1058.424,2.836
about -- something odd about the White House,1061.26,1.535
Press Secretary getting the CIA director on the,1062.795,2.068
phone to knock down a story about an,1064.863,2.536
investigation?,1067.399,0.868
"Mr Spicer: No, no, but see, respectfully, you&amp;#39;re",1068.267,1.768
using words like &amp;quot;knock down.&amp;quot; There was a story,1070.035,2.87
in a newspaper -- The Press: Was it disputed?,1072.905,2.068
Mr Spicer: Hold on.,1074.973,0.668
"No, no -- there was reporters coming to us",1075.641,2.502
"saying, there is a story out there, what&amp;#39;s your",1078.143,2.603
take on it?,1080.746,0.667
"And our answer was, we don&amp;#39;t believe it&amp;#39;s",1081.413,1.502
"accurate, we don&amp;#39;t* [do] believe it&amp;#39;s false.",1082.915,1.635
But obviously that&amp;#39;s our take on it.,1084.55,1.968
"And reporters were saying to us, well, is there",1086.518,2.636
anybody that you can point to to substantiate,1089.154,2.936
this claim?,1092.09,0.768
"Now, remember, this all started with the FBI",1092.858,2.669
"coming to us, bringing to our attention, saying that",1095.527,3.871
"the story in the Times was not accurate -- in fact,",1099.398,3.036
"it was BS -- and all we did was simply say, that&amp;#39;s",1102.434,3.17
"great, could you tell other reporters the same",1105.604,2.669
thing you&amp;#39;re telling us?,1108.273,1.635
"And I would think that other reporters, yourself",1109.908,2.069
"included, would think that that would be a helpful",1111.977,2.069
thing to get the story straight.,1114.046,2.202
All we sought to do was to actually get an,1116.248,2.736
accurate report out.,1118.984,1.401
"And again, I think Chairman Nunes this",1120.385,1.735
"morning, over and over and over and over again, made",1122.12,4.038
it very clear that no evidence that has been,1126.158,1.935
brought to his attention suggests that that,1128.093,1.969
reporting was accurate.,1130.062,1.401
"So, respectfully, I think it&amp;#39;s interesting that I&amp;#39;m",1131.463,4.638
being asked what&amp;#39;s appropriate when what,1136.101,2.002
we&amp;#39;re doing is actually urging reporters to engage,1138.103,3.137
with subject-matter experts who can,1141.24,1.901
corroborate whether or not,1143.141,1.836
something is accurate or not.,1144.977,1.067
The Press: Should there be a special prosecutor?,1146.044,1.869
Darrell Issa has called for a special prosecutor,1147.913,1.802
to look into this.,1149.715,0.667
"Mr Spicer: And I guess my question would be, a",1150.382,1.435
special prosecutor for what?,1151.817,1.368
The Press: To look into the whole Russia,1153.185,1.335
"connection, the whole Russia influencing -- Mr",1154.52,1.334
Spicer: And here&amp;#39;s my -- right.,1155.854,0.834
"And I guess my -- The Press: I mean, he was part",1156.688,1.669
"of the campaign, so -- I mean, Sessions was part of",1158.357,1.968
"the campaign, the Attorney General.",1160.325,2.069
Mr Spicer: I understand.,1162.394,0.701
"But here&amp;#39;s my question, Jonathan: We have now for",1163.095,1.368
six months heard story after story come out about,1164.463,3.537
unnamed sources say the same thing over and over,1168,2.802
"again, and nothing has come of it, right?",1170.802,3.804
"We&amp;#39;ve heard the same people, the same",1174.606,1.568
"anecdotes, and we&amp;#39;ve heard",1176.174,1.602
reports over and over again.,1177.776,1.535
"And as Chairman Nunes made very clear today, he has",1179.311,3.036
seen nothing that corroborates that.,1182.347,1.936
"So at what point -- you got to ask yourself, what",1184.283,1.935
are you investigating?,1186.218,1.802
"The Press: Well, Russian interference -- I mean,",1188.02,1.334
beyond the context.,1189.354,0.668
"Mr Spicer: No, and I think that both the House and",1190.022,1.468
the Senate have looked at it.,1191.49,1.001
You know as well as I do that the intelligence,1192.491,1.735
community has looked at it as well.,1194.226,1.735
There&amp;#39;s a big difference.,1195.961,0.667
I think that Russia&amp;#39;s involvement in activity,1196.628,3.304
has been investigated up and down.,1199.932,2.168
"So the question becomes at some point, if there&amp;#39;s",1202.1,2.036
"nothing to further investigate, what are you",1204.136,1.835
asking people to investigate?,1205.971,2.035
"I mean, Chairman Nunes spoke very clearly today",1208.006,2.503
when asked over and over and over again about all,1210.509,3.403
"of this, and said that he has seen nothing that",1213.912,2.536
leads him to believe that there&amp;#39;s there.,1216.448,1.969
The President has spoken forcefully time and time,1218.417,2.536
"again that he has no interests in Russia, he",1220.953,1.434
"hasn&amp;#39;t talked to people in Russia in years, and yet",1222.387,3.37
"you keep asking -- and when I say &amp;quot;you,&amp;quot;",1225.757,1.802
collectively -- to try to find something that,1227.559,2.836
"seemingly, at least the reporting that I&amp;#39;m seeing",1230.395,3.47
"in different organizations, suggests",1233.865,3.704
that there&amp;#39;s nothing new that&amp;#39;s being reported.,1237.569,3.17
It&amp;#39;s the same stuff over and over again that we&amp;#39;ve,1240.739,1.802
heard for literally six months.,1242.541,1.835
"And so the question becomes at some point,",1244.376,1.902
what do you need to further investigate if,1246.278,1.702
there is nothing that has come out?,1247.98,1.401
The Press: Can you not categorically deny there,1249.381,2.336
were no contacts between the Russians and anybody,1251.717,2.068
on the campaign?,1253.785,0.734
Mr Spicer: I can&amp;#39;t deny -- I can&amp;#39;t -- I guess my,1254.519,1.335
question is -- The Press: That&amp;#39;s what the,1255.854,1.335
investigation would look at.,1257.189,0.667
Mr Spicer: Right.,1257.856,0.834
"And I guess my point is, is that you&amp;#39;ve had the",1258.69,3.304
intelligence community look at Russia&amp;#39;s,1261.994,2.335
involvement in the election.,1264.329,1.735
You had the House and Senate both do the same.,1266.064,2.97
And so what I&amp;#39;m trying to ascertain is that at what,1269.034,2.736
point -- how many people have to say that there&amp;#39;s,1271.77,2.536
nothing there before you,1274.306,1.001
realize there&amp;#39;s nothing there?,1275.307,2.069
"I can&amp;#39;t say unequivocally -- all I&amp;#39;m saying is, the",1277.376,2.269
people who have done the investigating about Russia,1279.645,3.303
"overall and its activities in the United States,",1282.948,2.235
"specifically now with respect to our election,",1285.183,3.07
haven&amp;#39;t provided anything that leads me to believe,1288.253,3.103
or should lead you to believe -- and I continue,1291.356,1.969
to see reports coming from -- there were media,1293.325,1.902
sources saying when they checked in with law,1295.227,1.668
"enforcement, or intelligence community",1296.895,1.468
"sources, there&amp;#39;s nothing more than has been",1298.363,2.936
previously reported over and over again.,1301.299,2.57
"So, at some point, you do have to ask yourself, what",1303.869,2.435
are you actually looking for?,1306.304,1.769
How many times do you have to come to the same,1308.073,1.535
conclusion before you take the answer?,1309.608,2.969
And that&amp;#39;s where I -- Mara.,1312.577,1.402
"The Press: Just to be clear, did you -- just to",1313.979,2.469
"follow up on that, did you personally reach",1316.448,1.768
out to Pompeo?,1318.216,0.668
Mr Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to discuss what,1318.884,1.535
we did internally.,1320.419,0.734
I&amp;#39;m just going to say that when we shared -- we did,1321.153,3.036
our job about making sure that when people had --,1324.189,2.836
"reporters had questions, we let them know what",1327.025,2.403
subject-matter experts were available to discuss,1329.428,3.703
the accuracy of the newspaper story. Mara.,1333.131,1.502
"The Press: Yeah, I&amp;#39;m sure people will come back to",1334.633,1.768
"this, but I actually have a budget question, which",1336.401,2.67
"is: During the campaign, the President said he was",1339.071,3.236
not going to touch Medicare or Social Security.,1342.307,2.903
His Treasury Secretary repeated that.,1345.21,1.802
It sounded like the OMB Director was leaving that,1347.012,2.502
"as an open question, TBD.",1349.514,1.602
"I&amp;#39;m just wondering, what&amp;#39;s the state of the promise?",1351.116,2.97
That we won&amp;#39;t touch it for current retirees -- Mr,1354.086,3.403
Spicer: What the OMB Director made clear,1357.489,2.302
is how it works.,1359.791,0.834
The budget is dealing with the topline,1360.625,1.635
discretionary numbers.,1362.26,1.202
Policy decisions are not part of the budget.,1363.462,2.936
That was what he was being asked and what he -- so I,1366.398,2.736
just want to be clear in terms of what it was.,1369.134,1.668
"And again, I think --",1370.802,0.701
The Press: -- the state of the promise.,1371.503,1.335
In other words what is the promise.,1372.838,1.334
Mr Spicer: Right.,1374.172,0.668
And I think the state of the promise is clear.,1374.84,1.334
"And I think, as you point out, he had made the",1376.174,1.402
"promise, he stands by the promise.",1377.576,1.768
The Treasury Secretary -- The Press: But what,1379.344,1.602
is the promise?,1380.946,0.667
Current retirees?,1381.613,1.301
People near retirement? Anybody paying into --,1382.914,0.568
Mr Spicer: I will follow up,1383.482,0.634
specifically on that.,1384.116,0.967
But I think the President has made very clear that,1385.083,2.336
it&amp;#39;s not his intent to do -- he wants to focus on,1387.419,2.969
the discretionary side; that entitlement reform is,1390.388,2.837
"not -- that, with respect to those programs that he",1393.225,2.068
"mentioned, he stands by his word. Fred.",1395.293,2.269
The Press: I wanted to ask a couple issues.,1397.562,6.24
An executive order on religious freedom had,1403.802,2.536
previously been in the works.,1406.338,2.068
Will that still come?,1408.406,1.736
"And if it does, will it extend beyond",1410.142,2.335
religious freedom?,1412.477,0.734
"Mr Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sorry, Fred, what?",1413.211,2.236
The Press: Will it extend beyond the,1415.447,2.569
Johnson Amendment?,1418.016,0.734
Mr Spicer: I think we&amp;#39;ve discussed executive orders,1418.75,2.97
"in the past, and for the most part we&amp;#39;re not going",1421.72,2.302
to get into discussing what may or may not come,1424.022,2.703
until we&amp;#39;re ready to announce it.,1426.725,1.334
So I&amp;#39;m sure as we move forward,1428.059,2.136
we&amp;#39;ll have something.,1430.195,1.101
Olivier.,1431.296,0.667
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1431.963,1.168
"The Press: I&amp;#39;m sorry, just one more.",1433.131,2.536
The issue of types of reforms.,1435.667,2.202
Will there be -- how committed is the,1437.869,2.903
administration to a border adjustment tax?,1440.772,2.202
And is there any concern that there won&amp;#39;t be enough,1442.974,3.637
conservative support for that; that it could block,1446.611,2.937
any meaningful tax reform long-term?,1449.548,1.801
"Mr Spicer: Well, I&amp;#39;m not going to get into the",1451.349,2.036
specifics of tax reform today.,1453.385,1.868
The President has made clear that we&amp;#39;ll have an,1455.253,2.536
outline of the plan very soon.,1457.789,1.735
But what I will say is that I think he has talked,1459.524,2.069
about the concerns that he has with current,1461.593,3.303
regulatory and tax policy that benefit people from,1464.896,3.37
moving out of the country and shipping jobs -- or,1468.266,2.069
products back in while shedding American workers.,1470.335,3.036
He will continue to fight for policies that promote,1473.371,3.337
manufacturing and job creation in the United,1476.708,2.202
"States, and supports American workers.",1478.91,2.336
So I don&amp;#39;t want to get ahead of the exact,1481.246,2.169
nature of the policy.,1483.415,0.767
He has been seeking a lot of input.,1484.182,1.802
"As I mentioned earlier, he&amp;#39;s going to talk today",1485.984,2.269
with Speaker Ryan and Senator McConnell.,1488.253,2.803
"I know that both the joint session, the status of",1491.056,3.47
"repeal and replace, and I&amp;#39;m sure some discussion",1494.526,2.202
of tax reform will probably come up.,1496.728,1.568
But there&amp;#39;s a lot -- we&amp;#39;re continuing to move forward,1498.296,2.469
and work with them.,1500.765,0.668
Olivier.,1501.433,0.667
The Press: Thanks.,1502.1,0.667
A couple on the ISIS strategy.,1502.767,0.701
"Can you just get to the timetable from now, now",1503.468,2.803
that you received it -- what happens?,1506.271,1.635
And there&amp;#39;s a report that you&amp;#39;re asking for $30,1507.906,1.969
billion in emergency defense spending on top of,1509.875,2.369
the $54 [billion] in the budget.,1512.244,1.768
Is that true?,1514.012,0.901
Does that cover the new ISIS strategy?,1514.913,2.069
Can you explain what&amp;#39;s different between the two?,1516.982,2.369
Mr Spicer: Thank you.,1519.351,1.201
"Right now, literally, that principals meeting -- or",1520.552,2.069
principals meeting that I mentioned at the beginning,1522.621,2.402
is happening as we speak.,1525.023,1.134
So Secretary Mattis was coming over to brief the,1526.157,2.903
principals as far as the ISIS plan.,1529.06,2.937
"And again, part of it was to make sure that he fully",1531.997,3.803
discusses the recommendations that he&amp;#39;s,1535.8,1.635
making and seek the input and feedback of the other,1537.435,2.903
principals downstairs.,1540.338,1.468
"That can help guide where we go from here,",1541.806,2.536
how we go.,1544.342,1.135
"With respect to the funding, I think Director",1545.477,2.436
Mulvaney noted that there will be a supplemental,1547.913,1.801
at some point.,1549.714,0.935
"Right now the focus is on the budget, and then",1550.649,1.601
we&amp;#39;ll go from there.,1552.25,0.934
John Gizzi.,1553.184,0.668
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",1553.852,1.735
Two brief questions.,1555.587,1.101
"First, I read your statement at the Thursday",1556.688,3.003
briefing to Governor Malloy of Connecticut,1559.691,2.236
during the NGA meeting.,1561.927,1.501
And he responded -- and I quote -- &amp;quot;Sean didn&amp;#39;t read,1563.428,3.57
a thing that I said.&amp;quot; He said that he -- in,1566.998,3.304
"Connecticut, they are already working to get",1570.302,2.602
criminals who are in the country illegally out.,1572.904,3.003
His objection was to going into warming centers or,1575.907,3.337
schools where officials might frighten children.,1579.244,2.235
Your response to the Governor on that?,1581.479,2.603
"Mr Spicer: Well, again, I was asked specifically",1584.082,2.736
what his stance -- what the comments were with,1586.818,2.136
respect to sanctuary cities.,1588.954,1.201
"And again, I would reiterate, with all due",1590.155,2.536
"respect to the Governor, I&amp;#39;m not here to pick a",1592.691,2.168
fight with the Governor.,1594.859,1.035
I enjoyed my time going to school in the,1595.894,1.701
state of Connecticut.,1597.595,0.901
I have a kind affection of the Nutmeg State.,1598.496,2.903
"But the reality is, I think that there&amp;#39;s",1601.399,3.003
a difference.,1604.402,0.734
Whether or not what he wants to do is state,1605.136,2.169
"funds, maybe -- without knowing the exact nature",1607.305,3.237
"of how he&amp;#39;s funding, what he&amp;#39;s funding,",1610.542,2.769
it&amp;#39;s difficult.,1613.311,0.834
The question I was asked at the time was on how we,1614.145,2.87
would be handling it.,1617.015,1.001
"And I think the answer, whether it&amp;#39;s Connecticut",1618.016,1.735
"or California, is that the President&amp;#39;s executive",1619.751,2.736
order and the President&amp;#39;s commitment is to make sure,1622.487,3.203
that tax dollars are not used to support programs,1625.69,3.47
that are helping people who are not in the country,1629.16,1.535
legally and who are not citizens entitled to them.,1630.695,2.603
"The Press: One more question, Sean.",1633.298,2.436
Mr Spicer: Okay.,1635.734,1.167
Starting early.,1636.901,0.801
(Laughter.),1637.702,0.668
"The Press: For 58 years, when",1638.37,2.068
"Presidents have gone to Rome, they&amp;#39;ve always met",1640.438,3.137
"the Pope, going back to when President Eisenhower",1643.575,3.136
met Pope John XXIII.,1646.711,1.535
"Now, one year ago this week, candidate Trump had",1648.246,3.537
a disagreement with this Pope and an,1651.783,2.736
exchange of words.,1654.519,1.068
When he goes to Rome in May for his first European,1655.587,2.502
"trip, will he meet with this Pope?",1658.089,2.202
Mr Spicer: That&amp;#39;s a great question.,1660.291,1.736
"Obviously, I would be a huge fan of that.",1662.027,3.169
But I&amp;#39;m not going to -- I don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;re at that,1665.196,3.437
place in the planning process to make an,1668.633,2.035
announcement on any visits with the Pope. Blake.,1670.668,2.536
"The Press: Sean, thank you.",1673.204,2.036
"Two budget questions, if you don&amp;#39;t mind.",1675.24,2.869
"Mr. Mulvaney, I believe, just said that what the",1678.109,3.07
administration plans on putting forward doesn&amp;#39;t,1681.179,1.835
"add to the current deficit projection, which the CBO",1683.014,2.903
says is about $560 billion.,1685.917,1.702
But he didn&amp;#39;t say that it would significantly draw,1687.619,3.069
from that either.,1690.688,1.001
"So my first question is, is the administration",1691.689,2.737
comfortable putting something forward that,1694.426,1.701
might rack up deficits of potentially hundreds of,1696.127,2.703
billions of dollars?,1698.83,1.034
"Mr Spicer: Well, I think -- I&amp;#39;m trying to",1699.864,2.536
"understand the question a little, if you can help me",1702.4,1.435
with this. Because he --,1703.835,0.901
The Press: He said it wasn&amp;#39;t going,1704.736,1.601
to add to it.,1706.337,0.768
Mr Spicer: Right.,1707.105,0.667
"The Press: So my question is, he didn&amp;#39;t necessarily",1707.772,1.669
"say it was going to cut from it, either.",1709.441,1.735
"If it doesn&amp;#39;t cut from it, potentially it could be",1711.176,1.968
hundreds of billions in deficit.,1713.144,1.335
"And I&amp;#39;m curious -- Mr Spicer: Right, no, but I",1714.479,1.568
"think -- correct me if I&amp;#39;m wrong -- I mean, he",1716.047,1.335
basically made it very clear it doesn&amp;#39;t add to,1717.382,2.335
the projected baseline deficit.,1719.717,2.069
So that continues to be the goal.,1721.786,2.903
And I think as we continue to work through this,1724.689,1.402
"process, the passback, you know, it can",1726.091,2.135
work both ways.,1728.226,0.701
We could identify further savings and reductions,1728.927,2.903
"through working with the agencies and departments,",1731.83,2.469
but we&amp;#39;re going to make sure that the topline,1734.299,1.802
number we maintain is as close to that as possible.,1736.101,3.803
"And as we go through this -- I mean, this is the",1739.904,2.002
beginning of the process as the director noted.,1741.906,2.002
"We send the number to the department or the agency,",1743.908,2.803
"give them some ideas, how we came up with this, and",1746.711,1.902
then they come back to us and either justify why a,1748.613,4.204
"particular program or office, or what have you,",1752.817,3.637
needs to stay in existence or why maybe not the,1756.454,2.97
reduction that is offered.,1759.424,1.368
But it&amp;#39;s a back-and-forth process that will occur,1760.792,1.968
over the next few weeks.,1762.76,0.935
So to get ahead of it is the problem.,1763.695,2.269
The Press: Let me ask you what Nancy Pelosi -- to,1765.964,1.902
just get a quick reaction to Nancy Pelosi.,1767.866,2.202
She put out a statement and said the following:,1770.068,2.736
"&amp;quot;Five weeks into his administration, President",1772.804,1.501
Trump has not introduced a single jobs bill.&amp;quot; Your,1774.305,3.103
reaction to that would be what?,1777.408,2.069
Mr Spicer: He&amp;#39;s created a lot of jobs.,1779.477,2.736
I think that&amp;#39;s -- he&amp;#39;s continuing to work with,1782.213,2.236
"Congress on both repealing and replacing Obamacare,",1784.449,3.37
tax reform.,1787.819,0.667
"And, fundamentally, both of those two items alone I",1788.486,2.87
think can help spur a lot of economic growth.,1791.356,2.035
"The meetings that we&amp;#39;ve had with the CEOs, the",1793.391,4.505
health insurers -- there are so many things that,1797.896,4.237
are both job-killing and that can be done to help,1802.133,2.97
promote a better regulatory and tax climate,1805.103,2.936
that lead to job creation.,1808.039,1.735
I think that&amp;#39;s one of the biggest problems right now,1809.774,2.336
is that people in Washington aren&amp;#39;t,1812.11,1.835
"necessarily talking to job creators and saying, what",1813.945,2.703
is the impediment that you have to hiring more,1816.648,2.536
American workers?,1819.184,0.734
What are the impediments that you have to,1819.918,1.668
"manufacturing more, to building here?",1821.586,1.768
The meetings and the actions that the President,1823.354,3.204
has taken on both regulatory and other,1826.558,3.169
matters have helped spur job creation.,1829.727,4.638
You&amp;#39;ve heard these companies come in over and,1834.365,1.769
"over again -- the automakers, airlines,",1836.134,3.503
"Sprint -- I mean, the list goes on and on and on of",1839.637,2.77
"people saying to the President, because of your",1842.407,1.668
"agenda, because of your vision, we&amp;#39;re willing to",1844.075,2.202
commit to hiring additional people to,1846.277,1.769
manufacturing more.,1848.046,1.868
That&amp;#39;s how jobs are created -- it&amp;#39;s not,1849.914,1.802
through the government.,1851.716,1.368
"And too often, it&amp;#39;s the government regulations",1853.084,2.102
that stifle and prevent job creation.,1855.186,2.736
"And I think the President, as a businessman, fully",1857.922,2.436
appreciates and understands how this works,1860.358,2.569
and what some of those impediments do to creating,1862.927,3.137
jobs and to growing the economy.,1866.064,2.369
And so I would just say that you haven&amp;#39;t seen,1868.433,3.403
anything yet.,1871.836,0.667
It&amp;#39;s going to continue to be the case. Trey.,1872.503,1.335
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1873.838,0.834
Is there concern in the administration that a,1874.672,1.835
large-scale military buildup will appear,1876.507,2.002
threatening to other countries around the world,1878.509,1.635
and lead to some sort of arms race with other,1880.144,2.336
countries?,1882.48,0.667
"Mr Spicer: No, I think when you look at the state",1883.147,2.336
of some of the infrastructure in our,1885.483,1.902
"military, whether it&amp;#39;s the age of our ships or our",1887.385,1.668
planes or some of the other hardware that,1889.053,2.436
"exists, you recognize that we need to rebuild a lot",1891.489,4.638
of these things.,1896.127,0.934
The size of our Navy has gone down significantly.,1897.061,3.47
And there are new needs and new -- and when you,1900.531,2.369
look at the commitment that you have to make not,1902.9,2.937
"just in one year but in several years, for a lot",1905.837,2.936
"of these programs -- ships and tanks, even weapons",1908.773,3.403
systems -- they don&amp;#39;t get built in a month or a day.,1912.176,3.771
You have to make a commitment early on to,1915.947,2.836
make the investment because of the time that,1918.783,1.802
"it takes to procure them, to build them, the",1920.585,2.536
research and development that goes into it.,1923.121,1.334
And so I would just suggest to you that this,1924.455,2.269
is the first step in making sure we make the,1926.724,3.003
"commitment to a military that through, especially",1929.727,2.503
"through the sequester the last few years, has not",1932.23,2.335
gotten the funding it needs to get,1934.565,1.702
off life support.,1936.267,0.667
There are a lot of things that are being taken care,1936.934,2.403
of for the military where they&amp;#39;re just continuing to,1939.337,2.636
-- they&amp;#39;re not putting the systems and the projects,1941.973,4.338
in place to allow the military to keep up with,1946.311,2.702
"the times, and that&amp;#39;s a problem. Major.",1949.013,1.368
"The Press: Sean, one investigation question and",1950.381,1.902
one budget question.,1952.283,0.768
"As you may be aware, Bill Owens, the father of",1953.051,2.602
"William &amp;quot;Ryan&amp;quot; Owens, gave an interview with the",1955.653,2.102
"Miami Herald over the weekend and he said, &amp;quot;The",1957.755,2.236
government owes my son an investigation.&amp;quot; On behalf,1959.991,2.536
"of the President of the United States, is the",1962.527,2.536
President open to an investigation to the,1965.063,1.968
raid in Yemen?,1967.031,0.834
And the father of Ryan Owens called that a,1967.865,2.536
&amp;quot;stupid&amp;quot; mission.,1970.401,0.668
Is there something that you&amp;#39;d like to communicate,1971.069,2.135
to him about that mission that might,1973.204,1.969
persuade him otherwise?,1975.173,0.834
"Mr Spicer: Yeah, thank you.",1976.007,1.401
"That&amp;#39;s multi-part, so let me kind of walk",1977.408,2.403
through it slowly.,1979.811,1.434
"First of all, I can&amp;#39;t possibly imagine what he&amp;#39;s",1981.245,4.939
going through in terms of the loss of his son.,1986.184,3.57
"I can tell him that on behalf of the President,",1989.754,2.769
his son died a hero and the information that he,1992.523,6.473
"was able to help obtain through that raid, as I&amp;#39;ve",1998.996,5.272
"said before, is going to safe American lives.",2004.268,1.702
It&amp;#39;s going to protect our country more.,2005.97,1.902
So he made a sacrifice to this country.,2007.872,2.436
He was on his 12th deployment.,2010.308,2.402
"And I know that his wife, when she spoke to the",2012.71,2.403
"President, knows that he did this because he loved",2015.113,3.503
"it, he cared about our nation.",2018.616,2.669
And the mission was successful in helping,2021.285,3.17
prevent a future attack or attacks on this nation.,2024.455,2.736
It obtained a lot of information that will,2027.191,3.971
help us keep safe.,2031.162,2.302
"With respect to his request, it is standard",2033.464,3.871
operating procedure for the Department of Defense,2037.335,2.402
to undergo what they call a 15-6 review.,2039.737,3.037
"That review, in this case, is three-pronged.",2042.774,4.004
Because there was a fatality and a loss of,2046.778,1.701
"life, there&amp;#39;s that.",2048.479,2.269
"Because there were civilians involved,",2050.748,1.602
that&amp;#39;s another.,2052.35,0.667
And then third is because there was hardware -- a,2053.017,3.67
helicopter that was damaged.,2056.687,1.068
That is a separate.,2057.755,1.669
"So, in fact, there will be three reviews done by the",2059.424,4.537
Department of Defense because of the,2063.961,1.802
nature of this.,2065.763,0.901
"But, again, I can&amp;#39;t stress enough that on behalf of",2066.664,6.44
"the President, on behalf of this nation, we express",2073.104,4.471
"our condolences, extend our prayers to him",2077.575,4.371
during this time.,2081.946,1.001
"The Press: As you said, that is",2082.947,0.934
standard procedure.,2083.881,0.801
Is there anything the President is particularly,2084.682,1.668
"curious about with this mission, in that it was",2086.35,3.971
"brought to him, he authorized it quickly?",2090.321,2.236
Does he believe in the main it was carried out,2092.557,2.335
well and there&amp;#39;s nothing that he&amp;#39;s particularly,2094.892,3.137
curious about in the way either the helicopter was,2098.029,3.57
"damaged, fatality, the civilian casualties --",2101.599,2.336
anything of the like?,2103.935,1.568
"Mr Spicer: Well, number one, I&amp;#39;ve walked through",2105.503,2.402
the timetable previously in terms of how long this,2107.905,3.504
"had been planned for, dating well back into the",2111.409,3.503
previous administration.,2114.912,1.135
"And as you know, their recommendation at the time",2116.047,3.67
was to wait for a moonless night.,2119.717,1.735
That night wasn&amp;#39;t going to occur during President,2121.452,2.703
Obama&amp;#39;s administration.,2124.155,1.201
And so when General Mattis got into the Department of,2125.356,3.17
"Defense, he was briefed up on the status of the",2128.526,2.769
"thing, made aware of when the next time was go.",2131.295,2.369
We went through the process to ensure that we,2133.664,3.537
continued to believe that the mission -- the way it,2137.201,2.503
was going to be conducted and the results of the,2139.704,2.235
mission would be worthy of action.,2141.939,4.371
"The conclusion continued to be, as it was prior,",2146.31,2.469
that we should move forward.,2148.779,2.603
"As I mentioned before, I think you can&amp;#39;t ever say",2151.382,4.304
"that, when there&amp;#39;s most importantly loss of life",2155.686,3.571
"and people injured, that it&amp;#39;s",2159.257,2.802
100 percent successful.,2162.059,1.268
But I think when you look at what the stated goal of,2163.327,3.871
that mission was -- it was an information- and,2167.198,2.336
intelligence-gathering mission.,2169.534,2.202
And it achieved its objectives.,2171.736,1.034
"So, again, I would express our thoughts and our",2172.77,1.368
prayers and our condolences to all of the,2174.138,5.005
"people in Chief Owens&amp;#39;s family and his friends,",2182.947,4.404
his shipmates.,2187.351,2.002
"But it&amp;#39;s something that, as a SEAL and as somebody",2191.155,3.771
"who deployed 12 times, he knew that this was part of",2194.926,4.604
the job and he knew what he was doing.,2199.53,1.635
And so we&amp;#39;re very comfortable with how the,2201.165,3.804
"mission was executed, and we&amp;#39;ll let the Department",2204.969,4.504
of Defense go through that review process and then,2209.473,4.438
see where that leads us.,2213.911,0.834
But I think to get ahead of the three separate,2214.745,2.536
reviews that are being done by the Department of,2217.281,2.536
Defense would be probably a little,2219.817,1.869
irresponsible at this time.,2221.686,1.234
The Press: Sean --,2222.92,1.235
"Mr Spicer: Major gets two, too.",2224.155,1.835
The Press: Just real quick on the budget.,2225.99,2.469
"As you&amp;#39;re aware, to undo the defense sequester, you",2228.459,2.803
have to get 60 votes in the Senate because you,2231.262,3.07
have a separate domestic sequester number,2234.332,1.868
and defense.,2236.2,0.667
Are you confident with these numbers and with,2236.867,2.403
this kind of heavy discretionary spending cut,2239.27,2.169
"proposed, you can get the 60 votes to",2241.439,2.469
change the law?,2243.908,0.901
"Because without that change in law, the",2244.809,2.169
proposal is just that -- it doesn&amp;#39;t,2246.978,2.168
become operational.,2249.146,0.668
Mr Spicer: I think that when it comes to our,2249.814,3.036
"nation&amp;#39;s security, specifically our nation&amp;#39;s",2252.85,1.535
"military, I don&amp;#39;t think that it&amp;#39;s a",2254.385,2.169
partisan issue.,2256.554,0.667
I think that senators from across the country --,2257.221,2.603
whether you&amp;#39;re talking about Florida or whether,2259.824,2.869
you&amp;#39;ve got an Army installation or a Navy,2262.693,3.103
"base, you understand the state of repair that many",2265.796,5.306
"of our planes, ships and other hardware is in.",2271.102,5.138
And I think that there is a bipartisan commitment to,2276.24,3.37
give the military and its members the equipment and,2279.61,4.872
the tools it needs to succeed and,2284.482,2.235
protect this country.,2286.717,0.701
So I do feel confident.,2287.418,1.101
April.,2288.519,0.667
"The Press: Sean, I have a couple of budgetary",2289.186,2.703
questions for you.,2291.889,1.268
"One, at the press conference, President",2293.157,2.536
Trump talked about the fix for inner cities.,2295.693,3.37
What is the investment in this budget when it comes,2299.063,4.204
to a fix for inner cities?,2303.267,2.503
Mr Spicer: It&amp;#39;s a good try.,2305.77,1.635
I think the Director was very clear -- The Press:,2307.405,3.103
"That&amp;#39;s one -- Mr Spicer: mean, part of the process",2310.508,1.368
today was to start that passback process that he,2311.876,2.335
"talked about, where we&amp;#39;re going to the various",2314.211,2.503
"departments, whether it&amp;#39;s HUD or DOT, and giving",2316.714,2.069
them that topline number and then hearing back.,2318.783,2.269
So I don&amp;#39;t want to get into a specific number,2321.052,3.069
with you before we get too far down the process.,2324.121,2.57
I think that&amp;#39;s a conversation that we&amp;#39;re,2326.691,1.935
going to have with the agencies and then we will,2328.626,2.903
have subsequently with Congress when they start,2331.529,2.569
drafting their resolutions.,2334.098,1.535
"The Press: Okay, a follow-up on this, but I",2335.633,2.936
do have a question on HBCUs.,2338.569,1.568
"See, he talked about healthcare.",2340.137,1.335
He talked about education and he talked about crime.,2341.472,2.336
He needs to talk about Chicago and,2343.808,1.801
law enforcement.,2345.609,0.701
So you don&amp;#39;t have any kind of budgetary numbers when,2346.31,2.436
it comes to it?,2348.746,1.168
And healthcare is a piece that is one of the line,2349.914,1.768
items for this budget.,2351.682,0.868
Mr Spicer: That&amp;#39;s right.,2352.55,0.867
And I&amp;#39;m not saying that we don&amp;#39;t have numbers.,2353.417,1.802
I&amp;#39;m saying that we&amp;#39;re not giving them out.,2355.219,2.002
That&amp;#39;s a big difference.,2357.221,1.735
The Press: (Inaudible.),2358.956,0.667
Mr Spicer: I know.,2359.623,0.901
(Laughter.),2360.524,0.668
You&amp;#39;re going to do a good job trying.,2361.192,1.334
(Laughter.),2362.526,0.701
"But as the Director noted on this,",2363.227,1.835
that they have come up with topline numbers based,2365.062,3.604
on their going through each of these agencies&amp;#39;,2368.666,2.769
"budget, and saying, hey, there&amp;#39;s a duplicative",2371.435,2.836
program here.,2374.271,0.668
"In some cases, maybe they give them more, maybe they",2374.939,2.235
give them less.,2377.174,0.734
"Part of it is to begin that conversation, that",2377.908,1.969
"process, with the departments and agencies",2379.877,3.871
to figure out what those investments are.,2383.748,1.601
Maybe it&amp;#39;s repurposing existing funds in a,2385.349,1.969
different way.,2387.318,2.002
So it&amp;#39;s not necessarily a zero-sum game.,2389.32,3.069
There is a way that a department can reallocate,2392.389,2.703
money to a program that might end up benefitting,2395.092,4.038
because there is a duplicative or out-of-date,2399.13,4.17
program or office that that savings could be,2403.3,3.704
applied to something.,2407.004,0.667
But I don&amp;#39;t want to get ahead of the process right,2407.671,2.103
"now, only to say that we are at the very",2409.774,1.801
beginning of it.,2411.575,0.668
The Press: And one on HBCUs.,2412.243,1.301
Mr Spicer: Yes.,2413.544,0.901
The Press: The President is going to see the,2414.445,2.169
80-plus presence of HBCUs with the,2416.614,2.369
Vice President today.,2418.983,1.134
Some of them are very concerned as to what this,2420.117,3.17
"executive order looks like, and they are waiting",2423.287,2.703
"to hear the commitment before they say, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m all",2425.99,2.302
in.&amp;quot; What is the commitment that this,2428.292,2.436
President is trying to make when it comes to,2430.728,2.235
"HBCUs to ensure, I guess, their future, or deal with",2432.963,4.738
"funding for research projects, what have you,",2437.701,2.203
or moving it out of the Department of Education to,2439.904,2.469
the purview of the White House?,2442.373,1.568
What is the commitment that he&amp;#39;s going to,2443.941,2.102
give to them?,2446.043,0.801
"Mr Spicer: So, look, I don&amp;#39;t generally speak",2446.844,2.102
about executive orders until they&amp;#39;re finalized.,2448.946,1.602
I will just say that one of the things that I think,2450.548,3.703
there&amp;#39;s commitment from this White House to do is,2454.251,2.703
to look at the various resources throughout the,2456.954,1.869
federal government that support HBCUs.,2458.823,2.669
"So, for example, the Department of Defense has",2461.492,4.137
ROTC and NROTC programs.,2465.629,3.237
Are they being properly -- is that funding being,2468.866,3.07
properly executed and spent.,2471.936,2.002
There&amp;#39;s programs within each of the departments --,2473.938,2.702
"the Department of Education, the Department",2476.64,2.169
of Housing and Urban Development -- that affect,2478.809,2.87
grants or programs or direct funding that go to,2481.679,5.939
"HBCUs for various different things, whether",2487.618,2.069
"it&amp;#39;s construction projects, or teaching",2489.687,2.602
"programs, or mentorship programs.",2492.289,1.802
"Whatever it is, they span throughout the",2494.091,2.269
entire government.,2496.36,1.568
And I think that what we are committed to doing is,2497.928,3.137
ensuring that there is a high level of,2501.065,4.671
"understanding and commitment, that goes",2505.736,2.269
"straight to the President, of how we harness those",2508.005,2.502
"resource within the government, and make sure",2510.507,2.837
that they&amp;#39;re doing what they&amp;#39;re supposed,2513.344,1.334
to be doing.,2514.678,0.668
"So it&amp;#39;s one thing to have them, right, spread",2515.346,3.803
throughout the different departments.,2519.149,1.469
It&amp;#39;s another thing to make sure that there&amp;#39;s a direct,2520.618,2.302
pipeline to the President of the United States that,2522.92,2.202
those programs are being executed in a way that&amp;#39;s,2525.122,1.969
benefitting the future of HBCUs and the various,2527.091,4.037
projects and teaching that goes on there.,2531.128,2.336
The Press: And so what are you saying -- there&amp;#39;s,2533.464,3.003
going to be a piece that is going to basically go,2536.467,2.803
throughout all the agencies to make sure that,2539.27,2.235
there is some kind of commitment to HBCUs and,2541.505,3.103
"contract of like, let&amp;#39;s say engineering for some",2544.608,2.536
"schools, or in research for other schools?",2547.144,2.703
"Mr Spicer: Yeah, I would say -- I think I&amp;#39;m going",2549.847,3.737
to stick to waiting until we announce it to get,2553.584,2.336
out a lot more.,2555.92,0.767
The Press: Is that today or tomorrow?,2556.687,2.236
Mr Spicer: I anticipate it very soon.,2558.923,1.334
How is that?,2560.257,0.668
I want to give myself a little wiggle room.,2560.925,1.334
Phil Rucker.,2562.259,0.668
"The Press: Yeah, Sean, thanks.",2562.927,0.867
"A budget-related question, but on infrastructure.",2563.794,2.102
"The President has repeatedly, including",2565.896,2.102
"today, again, called for a major infrastructure plan",2567.998,3.37
"to the tune a trillion dollars -- roads, bridges,",2571.368,2.703
"tunnels, you name it.",2574.071,2.002
Can you explain where that money is going to come,2576.073,2.302
"from, how it fits into the budget that&amp;#39;s under review",2578.375,2.069
"right now, and what the timeline for that",2580.444,2.069
project would be?,2582.513,0.801
Mr Spicer: So I think that would be part of a,2583.314,3.803
longer-term discussion that we&amp;#39;re,2587.117,1.635
having with Congress.,2588.752,1.602
"As you know, the President got in",2590.354,1.568
office 30-some-odd days ago.,2591.922,1.468
"The idea of getting a budget is -- you know,",2593.39,2.369
it&amp;#39;s commonly referred to as a skinny budget -- is,2595.759,2.002
to get the government to continue to be funding and,2597.761,3.337
it will be something that we&amp;#39;ll work with Congress.,2601.098,1.368
I understand your point.,2602.466,0.667
The President continues to talk about the status --,2603.133,1.936
The Press: -- a priority for him.,2605.069,1.334
Mr Spicer: It is.,2606.403,0.901
Absolutely.,2607.304,0.668
But I think that we&amp;#39;ve got to make sure that it&amp;#39;s,2607.972,1.401
done right and that we work with Congress.,2609.373,1.368
"I think, as you correctly mention, there&amp;#39;s obviously",2610.741,2.369
a funding mechanism to this.,2613.11,1.301
And we&amp;#39;ve already talked about things like,2614.411,2.202
comprehensive tax reform that could add to that,2616.613,4.839
discussion.,2621.452,0.967
And so I just -- I understand what you&amp;#39;re,2622.419,1.969
asking in terms of how this would be funded and,2624.388,2.102
"when it will be coming, and the pay-fors, but",2626.49,2.703
we&amp;#39;re working with Congress to have,2629.193,1.601
that discussion.,2630.794,0.668
I think that comes probably outside of the,2631.462,1.635
budget discussion.,2633.097,0.734
The Press: And so how does he square that with the,2633.831,2.169
"need to tighten the belt, which he also talked about",2636,2.302
today -- we&amp;#39;ve been spending too much as a,2638.302,1.702
government and we need to cut our spending?,2640.004,1.801
"Mr Spicer: Right, but I think -- but in the same",2641.805,1.335
manner that we&amp;#39;re presenting the budget.,2643.14,1.335
So we&amp;#39;re talking about adding $54 million -- $54,2644.475,2.202
"trillion, rather -- a billion dollars to --",2646.677,1.601
thank you.,2648.278,0.668
Appreciate the help here.,2648.946,2.602
(Laughter.),2651.548,0.835
But we&amp;#39;re looking to add,2652.383,2.669
that to defense.,2655.052,0.701
And so what it means is that we have to look,2655.753,1.434
through other programs to find reductions,2657.187,2.002
in savings.,2659.189,0.868
I think that same kind of discussion would happen,2660.057,2.235
"with respect to infrastructure, not",2662.292,1.335
"necessarily the savings piece, but the funding",2663.627,1.335
piece; that there&amp;#39;s several ways -- and I know,2664.962,1.334
"that there&amp;#39;s a lot of discussion, private-public",2666.296,1.335
partnerships that he is started to have a,2667.631,1.368
discussion with in terms of the funding mechanism.,2668.999,1.335
And so all I&amp;#39;m trying to get at is that there are,2670.334,1.334
various ways to do this funding without just,2671.668,1.335
relying on the American taxpayer in terms of,2673.003,1.335
additional taxes.,2674.338,0.667
"There are spending reductions, there are",2675.005,1.335
"other funding mechanisms, and I think, in due",2676.34,1.368
"course, we will get around to that discussion.",2677.708,1.335
"The Press: And just related to that, he",2679.043,1.334
mentioned in his remarks about infrastructure today,2680.377,2.169
that as he drives through the Queens-Midtown tunnel,2682.546,2.469
"and the Lincoln tunnel, he worries about",2685.015,1.335
ceiling tiles falling.,2686.35,1.568
Is there a specific incident he was talking,2687.918,2.936
"about where people have been injured, or is that",2690.854,4.972
just a fear of his?,2699.396,4.738
Mr Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know.,2704.134,4.738
I&amp;#39;ll ask.,2708.872,1.902
(Laughter.),2710.774,0.934
But I&amp;#39;m sure Secret Service will take,2711.708,2.37
care of the -- alleviating the medium concerns.,2714.078,2.869
Hold on.,2716.947,0.667
Alexis.,2717.614,0.668
"The Press: Sean, I have two questions.",2718.282,1.401
"First, one on healthcare.",2719.683,1.034
Because the OMB director was signaling that the,2720.717,3.404
"complete budget would be made ready early May, and",2724.121,3.804
the President today described how complicated,2727.925,2.569
he had discovered that the healthcare repeal and,2730.494,3.37
"replace has become, can you describe when it is",2733.864,3.837
that the President would present his framework for,2737.701,3.57
an overhaul of healthcare?,2741.271,1.602
Is it going to be included in the budget so we would,2742.873,2.336
see it before May?,2745.209,0.8
Mr Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;re going to see it in,2746.009,2.203
"the budget, no.",2748.212,0.667
That&amp;#39;s not the appropriate vehicle for it.,2748.879,1.635
I think I&amp;#39;ve mentioned it before.,2750.514,2.002
I think you would drive -- or at least the leading,2752.516,2.803
"option, before I get locked into something, is",2755.319,2.836
to add Obamacare to the FY17 budget process and,2758.155,4.404
put it through reconciliation.,2762.559,1.735
So that would happen outside of the current,2764.294,1.769
budget structure.,2766.063,0.7
But I think he has also been very clear that he,2766.763,3.204
"wants this outline within a matter of weeks, and",2769.967,2.435
that we continue to have these discussions with,2772.402,2.103
"House and Senate leadership, with Ways and",2774.505,1.534
"Means, and Energy and Commerce, and then similar",2776.039,2.97
on Senate finance on the Senate side.,2779.009,2.136
So when he talks to Speaker Ryan and Leader,2781.145,4.304
"McConnell today, I&amp;#39;m sure that conversation",2785.449,2.636
will continue.,2788.085,0.667
"The Press: Just to follow up on healthcare, because",2788.752,2.069
not every ingredient in the Affordable Care Act,2790.821,2.202
can be handled in reconciliation.,2793.023,1.368
That&amp;#39;s why I was asking about the elements of it,2794.391,2.77
that we see in the budget.,2797.161,1.634
Mr Spicer: That&amp;#39;s right.,2798.795,1.102
The Press: So we will see some of those?,2799.897,2.469
"Mr Spicer: Well, there&amp;#39;s several pieces",2802.366,2.235
of Obamacare.,2804.601,0.768
"Some can be done by executive order, some get",2805.369,2.135
"done with 50 votes, some have to be done",2807.504,1.802
specifically in reconciliation.,2809.306,1.368
I think counter to Major&amp;#39;s point on a previous,2810.674,1.702
"question, that there are certain things that have",2812.376,2.135
"to be done in certain ways legislatively, and to",2814.511,2.936
create a comprehensive and holistic approach to both,2817.447,2.937
repealing it and replacing it.,2820.384,1.034
And we&amp;#39;re aware of that.,2821.418,1.435
We&amp;#39;re working with the House and the Senate to,2822.853,1.768
make that happen.,2824.621,0.701
The Press: And my second topic.,2825.322,2.002
Mr Spicer: Of course.,2827.324,1.368
The Press: All right.,2828.692,1.368
"The immigration executive order, the travel ban --",2830.06,2.703
is the President going to address the American,2832.763,2.702
people and Congress in his speech tomorrow night and,2835.465,3.037
specifically describe and defend the,2838.502,1.702
immigration ban?,2840.204,0.667
And when will we see the revised executive order?,2840.871,3.036
Mr Spicer: So we&amp;#39;re not going to -- I would not,2843.907,3.103
anticipate the speech being a defense of,2847.01,3.47
legislation and executive orders.,2850.48,1.635
I don&amp;#39;t think many previous Presidents have,2852.115,2.87
gotten through and used that as a,2854.985,2.703
legislative walkthrough.,2857.688,2.068
But you will hear about his commitment to,2859.756,3.804
"immigration and his desire for border security, and",2863.56,2.569
what it means not just about keeping the nation,2866.129,2.736
"safe, but what impact it&amp;#39;s having on the economy.",2868.865,2.837
So you will hear a lot about immigration tomorrow,2871.702,3.67
"night, and he will talk about why it matters and",2875.372,3.737
the goal that we have and why we should come,2879.109,1.902
together on areas like this.,2881.011,1.034
"The Press: Can I follow up on that, Sean?",2882.045,1.769
Mr Spicer: Hold on.,2883.814,0.667
Katelyn.,2884.481,0.667
The Press: Where&amp;#39;s the next order?,2885.148,1.335
"Mr Spicer: Oh, I&amp;#39;m sorry.",2886.483,0.667
The next order I think we should have it out,2887.15,1.335
probably middle of this week.,2888.485,0.667
Looking towards the middle of the week.,2889.152,1.335
And we&amp;#39;ll have further updates as we get through,2890.487,1.368
the schedule.,2891.855,0.667
I think obviously our priority right now today,2892.522,1.335
"was the really get the budget process kicked off,",2893.857,1.335
and then continue to prepare for the,2895.192,6.473
joint session.,2901.665,0.667
Katelyn.,2902.332,0.668
The Press: Thank you.,2903,0.767
"The Press: Sean, can I follow on that?",2903.767,2.503
Mr Spicer: You will in a second.,2906.27,2.202
The Press: An internal report in 2015 identified,2908.472,2.502
$125 billion in wasteful Pentagon spending.,2910.974,1.869
So how can you justify adding $54 billion to the,2912.843,3.136
defense budget?,2915.979,0.668
Is that going to go to hiring soldiers or,2916.647,2.769
bureaucrats or contractors?,2919.416,0.934
And is the President concerned with wasteful,2920.35,2.202
spending at the DOD?,2922.552,1.235
Mr Spicer: Of course he&amp;#39;s concerned.,2923.787,1.902
He&amp;#39;s concerned with wasteful spending,2925.689,1.535
throughout the government.,2927.224,0.967
But I think there&amp;#39;s also a big difference between,2928.191,2.803
rooting out waste and fraud in various programs,2930.994,2.503
"and offices, and understanding that when",2933.497,1.868
you&amp;#39;re talking about adding to the fleet or,2935.365,2.503
"increasing airplane costs, that that can&amp;#39;t be driven",2937.868,2.502
just through those.,2940.37,0.968
And the commitment that you have to make to,2941.338,2.803
purchase some of those very-needed upgrades to,2944.141,2.202
our infrastructure and to our arsenal and to planes,2946.343,2.803
and ships doesn&amp;#39;t just come through that.,2949.146,2.202
"Because even if you could start to really identify,",2951.348,2.803
you really wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to make the financial,2954.151,2.836
commitment that needs to be done to rebuild some of,2956.987,3.103
the ships and planes in particular that need a,2960.09,2.836
substantial investment on the front end.,2962.926,1.869
John.,2964.795,0.667
The Press: If I could just follow on,2965.462,2.135
Alexis&amp;#39;s question.,2967.597,0.701
The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals has just denied,2968.298,2.77
your request to suspend proceedings in regard to,2971.068,2.502
the initial executive order.,2973.57,1.235
That order came out just within the last,2974.805,2.502
few minutes.,2977.307,0.667
So do you plan to continue defending your first,2977.974,2.77
executive order in court?,2980.744,1.268
And what&amp;#39;s the purpose of doing that as opposed to,2982.012,4.104
simply rescinding it and then rendering,2986.116,1.802
that case moot?,2987.918,0.867
"Mr Spicer: Well, I haven&amp;#39;t been able to read my phone",2988.785,2.57
while this has happened.,2991.355,0.867
So I -- The Press: That&amp;#39;s why I read -- Mr Spicer:,2992.222,2.97
(Laughter.),2995.192,0.667
"Thank you, I appreciate it.",2995.859,0.734
"So with all due respect, I would ask that I be able",2996.593,2.569
to get back to you tomorrow on that after we,2999.162,1.602
consult with the Counsel&amp;#39;s Office and go through the,3000.764,3.27
"briefing and the -- excuse me, the reading of what",3004.034,2.569
the court has said.,3006.603,0.834
"But give me a little time, let me get off the podium",3007.437,2.569
"-- The Press: I mean, the rescinding it question",3010.006,1.802
"still stands, regardless of the -- Mr Spicer: I",3011.808,3.07
"understand that, and I think that the President",3014.878,2.236
has made a commitment right now to continue to,3017.114,1.635
defend what we did.,3018.749,0.734
The Press: For what reason?,3019.483,0.901
Mr Spicer: Hold on.,3020.384,0.767
Because this is the strategy that -- he,3021.151,1.735
believes that we have the authority vested,3022.886,2.97
in U.S. code.,3025.856,0.8
I&amp;#39;ve talked about this extensively in the past.,3026.656,3.137
"And I think that if you&amp;#39;ll allow me, once we get done",3029.793,2.836
"with the briefing, I will follow up with the",3032.629,1.368
Counsel&amp;#39;s Office.,3033.997,0.768
The Press: But the point that some of us are trying,3034.765,1.534
"to understand is, if you have a new executive order",3036.299,2.303
that you believe addresses the concerns of the many,3038.602,2.636
"courts who have weighed in on this, why continue to",3041.238,2.769
defend an executive order that -- Mr Spicer:,3044.007,2.369
"Because he&amp;#39;s -- I mean, because we were right",3046.376,1.335
the first time.,3047.711,0.667
And I think that -- The Press: Are you trying,3048.378,1.335
to prove a point?,3049.713,0.701
"Mr Spicer: Hold on -- no, but I think that it&amp;#39;s not",3050.414,1.334
a question of proving a point.,3051.748,1.635
It&amp;#39;s that the manner in which it was done in the,3053.383,2.336
first place was what we believe and continue to,3055.719,4.671
believe was the right way to address this problem.,3060.39,2.569
And while the second executive order attempts,3062.959,2.67
"to address the court&amp;#39;s concerns that they made,",3065.629,4.538
the goal is obviously to maintain the way that we,3070.167,2.002
did it the first time because we believe that,3072.169,3.236
the law is very clear about giving the President,3075.405,2.036
the authority that he needs to,3077.441,1.234
protect the country.,3078.675,0.701
So just dropping that is not necessarily the,3079.376,4.604
most prudent thing.,3083.98,0.734
And I think part of it is for us to recoup right,3084.714,2.269
"now, figure out what the court has said, and then",3086.983,2.97
reassess the strategy.,3089.953,0.801
"But I don&amp;#39;t want to get ahead, as you point out,",3090.754,2.169
you&amp;#39;re reading it to me now -- I would like the,3092.923,1.935
opportunity to maybe go read it and actually have,3094.858,2.669
a lawyer read it -- since that won&amp;#39;t do very much.,3097.527,2.002
Go ahead.,3099.529,0.668
"The Press: Sean, thank you.",3100.197,1.301
"On anti-Semitism, that was a good, strong statement.",3101.498,2.202
Is there anything that the federal government can do,3103.7,2.503
to protect Jewish institutions?,3106.203,1.134
Are there any leads who is doing this?,3107.337,2.236
"And also on sequester, when can",3109.573,1.668
sequester be lifted?,3111.241,0.834
Mr Spicer: When can it be lifted?,3112.075,1.935
The Press: Yes.,3114.01,0.835
Mr Spicer: I think we&amp;#39;ve got to go through the,3114.845,2.135
"process to lift the sequester, and so we&amp;#39;ll",3116.98,2.569
deal with that.,3119.549,0.668
With respect to some of the activity that we&amp;#39;ve,3120.217,1.835
"seen at Jewish cemeteries in particular -- look, I",3122.052,3.069
think we have to work with law enforcement at a local,3125.121,1.869
and state level.,3126.99,1.101
I&amp;#39;ll leave it to the Department of Justice to,3128.091,2.202
comment further on what additional steps,3130.293,1.969
can be made.,3132.262,0.867
But I think -- as has been pointed out multiple,3133.129,2.103
"times, I think one of the things that we can do is",3135.232,2.535
"speak from this podium, in particular, and other",3137.767,2.103
places to make sure that every American understands,3139.87,3.903
"what our values are, and that that kind of behavior",3143.773,4.872
"and activity is wrong and won&amp;#39;t be tolerated, and",3148.645,4.037
the highest levels of government denounce it.,3152.682,1.869
So I think it starts at that.,3154.551,2.069
And then I think there&amp;#39;s a law enforcement component,3156.62,1.768
that I would ask you to touch base with.,3158.388,2.002
"The Press: Sean, two on the budget.",3160.39,2.035
Mr Spicer: Yes.,3162.425,0.868
The Press: I understand this is a blueprint.,3163.293,2.302
I understand the President has previously said he,3165.595,2.336
doesn&amp;#39;t want to touch entitlements.,3167.931,1.468
But why does he think it&amp;#39;s the right move to break,3169.399,2.97
"with years of Republican orthodoxy, House Speaker",3172.369,2.235
"Paul Ryan, who have said that any sensible",3174.604,2.703
long-term budget needs to include,3177.307,1.668
entitlement reform?,3178.975,0.668
"Mr Spicer: Look, I&amp;#39;m just going to -- I think the",3179.643,2.769
President understands the commitment that was made,3182.412,3.27
to seniors in particular and that it&amp;#39;s a,3185.682,2.369
sacred bond and a trust.,3188.051,1.068
"And I think -- look, Mara asked this earlier -- I",3189.119,2.836
think let me get back to you on the specifics.,3191.955,2.669
But I think he made a commitment to,3194.624,2.136
the American people.,3196.76,0.667
And one of the things that I think the President,3197.427,1.935
continues to get high marks on is that,3199.362,2.069
"regardless of whether you voted for him or not, or",3201.431,1.635
"you agree with his policies, he&amp;#39;s a",3203.066,1.335
man of his word.,3204.401,0.901
And he has followed up on the promises that he made,3205.302,2.769
to the American people.,3208.071,1.502
And I think that&amp;#39;s important.,3209.573,1.568
"Now, again, I think that we will continue to work",3211.141,2.402
with Congress.,3213.543,2.002
But the President understands that we have,3215.545,4.171
commitments that we&amp;#39;ve made on the entitlement,3219.716,1.735
"side, in particular, and especially on the senior",3221.451,3.303
side with respect to Social Security that,3224.754,2.336
need to be maintained.,3227.09,0.734
And so he&amp;#39;s going to keep this word to the,3227.824,3.904
American people.,3231.728,0.667
"The Press: But if you talk to some economic analysts,",3232.395,1.902
"they say Social Security, Medicare won&amp;#39;t be there in",3234.297,1.535
a number of years if we don&amp;#39;t address the,3235.832,1.368
fundamental problems.,3237.2,0.667
Mr Spicer: And I think that -- right.,3237.867,1.335
"And so for right now, I think the budget that",3239.202,2.269
we&amp;#39;re laying out deals on the discretionary side.,3241.471,3.604
You&amp;#39;ve heard the President&amp;#39;s priorities and,3245.075,1.468
"commitment, especially when it comes to",3246.543,1.802
protecting this country.,3248.345,1.167
"And if we have anything further,",3249.512,1.335
I&amp;#39;ll let you know.,3250.847,0.667
"The Press: And one more -- Sean, one more.",3251.514,1.335
Is there an internal leak inquiry right now?,3252.849,1.335
Mr Spicer: Not that I&amp;#39;m aware of.,3254.184,1.802
"The Press: Thank you very much, Sean.",3255.986,1.835
"I have two questions on U.S.-China relationship,",3257.821,1.835
if I may.,3259.656,0.767
Mr Spicer: You may.,3260.423,1.035
The Press: Thank you.,3261.458,1.034
Mr Spicer: Everyone else gets two.,3262.492,1.568
"The Press: First of all, since President Trump took",3264.06,2.336
"office, China sends it very first senior",3266.396,2.369
"official, State Counselor Yang Jiechi, to visit",3268.765,2.936
"Washington, D.C. today.",3271.701,1.268
Will there will be a meeting with in the White,3272.969,4.238
"House, and what&amp;#39;s the White House&amp;#39;s",3277.207,2.536
expectation of his visit?,3279.743,1.668
"Mr Spicer: So the State Counselor, and for those",3281.411,2.636
"of you not schooled in the Chinese government, is",3284.047,3.036
basically the equivalent of our NSA Director -- NSC,3287.083,4.238
"Director, correct?",3291.321,0.667
The Press: Yes.,3291.988,1.135
Mr Spicer: So the Ambassador and the State,3293.123,3.27
Counselor came today.,3296.393,1.234
They had a meeting with H.R.,3297.627,2.436
"McMaster, Jared Kushner, and I think some others",3300.063,2.035
sat in on the meeting.,3302.098,2.002
They had a delegation of six people here.,3304.1,2.97
"After the meeting ended, I believe the State",3307.07,2.536
Counselor was taken and had an opportunity to say,3309.606,3.036
hi to the President before he left.,3312.642,1.535
This is an opportunity to begin that conversation,3314.177,3.37
and talk to them on shared interests of,3317.547,2.336
national security.,3319.883,0.734
"The Press: Sean -- Mr Spicer: Sorry, hold on.",3320.617,1.334
He gets one more.,3321.951,0.668
Everybody else did.,3322.619,0.667
The Press: Can I have a follow up?,3323.286,1.368
"Mr Spicer: Hold on, hold on, hold on.",3324.654,1.335
Let me just -- everybody else got two.,3325.989,1.334
"The Press: Yes, just this morning, President Trump",3327.323,2.069
"mentioned about his pick for ambassador to China,",3329.392,4.071
Governor -- Mr Spicer: Branstad.,3333.463,2.536
The Press: Branstad.,3335.999,1.535
Governor Branstad apparently has a really,3337.534,2.269
positive view on China.,3339.803,1.334
Mr Spicer: Yeah.,3341.137,1.101
The Press: So how confident the President is,3342.238,2.97
on the Governor&amp;#39;s confirmation to get all,3345.208,2.603
the support in the Senate?,3347.811,1.868
"Mr Spicer: Oh, I think he&amp;#39;ll receive tremendous",3349.679,2.536
support -- bipartisan support.,3352.215,1.468
Governor Branstad has been -- is a true -- he has,3353.683,6.106
huge ties on both sides.,3359.789,1.302
I think he&amp;#39;s one of the longest serving governors,3361.091,2.302
"ever, definitely in Iowa.",3363.393,1.101
And I think that he has tremendous respect from,3364.494,2.102
both sides of the aisle not just for how he&amp;#39;s,3366.596,2.603
"handled himself as a governor in Iowa, but his",3369.199,3.236
deep understanding and ties to China and to,3372.435,2.97
China&amp;#39;s economy and to Chinese officials.,3375.405,2.269
And I think he&amp;#39;s going to do a phenomenal job,3377.674,2.636
representing our nation.,3380.31,0.867
He starts with a deep understanding of the,3381.177,2.57
"Chinese economy, the Chinese government, and",3383.747,2.335
that is going to really serve our nation well. Mara.,3386.082,2.369
The Press: Can I just have a follow-up on China?,3388.451,1.869
Thank you.,3390.32,0.667
Because I know I got one before.,3390.987,1.335
Mr Spicer: You did.,3392.322,0.667
The Press: I appreciate that.,3392.989,0.768
A lot of people voted for Donald Trump because they,3393.757,1.801
felt -- they agreed with him that the U.S.,3395.558,2.436
was getting ripped off by China.,3397.994,2.302
"And after the election, he made the call to Taiwan,",3400.296,2.837
which he was praised for.,3403.133,0.967
"Then he told Fox News -- he said, &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know why",3404.1,2.136
we have to be bound by a one-China policy unless we,3406.236,3.036
make a deal with China having to do with other,3409.272,2.769
"things, including trade.&amp;quot; Then he reaffirmed",3412.041,1.669
the one-China policy.,3413.71,0.834
So what did he get in return from China,3414.544,2.502
for doing that?,3417.046,0.835
"Mr Spicer: Well, he had a conversation",3417.881,1.801
with President Xi.,3419.682,0.868
I&amp;#39;m not going to get into the details of it.,3420.55,2.469
But at the President&amp;#39;s -- President Xi&amp;#39;s request and,3423.019,4.705
"after a discussion, the President reaffirmed the",3427.724,2.536
one-China policy.,3430.26,1.735
The President is not one to discuss his,3431.995,2.469
negotiating tactics. So I --,3434.464,1.835
The Press: But did he get something?,3436.299,5.172
Can he assure the American people he got something?,3441.471,1.335
Mr Spicer: The President always gets something. Ryan.,3442.806,1.368
"The Press: Well, what was it?",3444.174,0.667
What was it?,3444.841,0.667
"The Press: Sean, two quick follow-ups.",3445.508,1.335
"First of all, I noticed earlier today there were a",3446.843,1.335
lot of Republican governors out here but not,3448.178,1.334
very many Democratic governors.,3449.512,0.668
Is this administration actively attempting to,3450.18,2.502
reach out to the other side of the aisle,3452.682,1.869
for compromise?,3454.551,0.9
Mr Spicer: Yeah.,3455.451,1.402
I think if you saw the remarks during this pool,3456.853,3.036
"opportunity, the President talked about some of the",3459.889,4.004
conversations he had with Governor McAuliffe in,3463.893,1.702
Virginia in particular.,3465.595,1.368
"But they were here last night, they had dinner",3466.963,2.803
with their wives and husbands.,3469.766,2.102
It was an opportunity to really talk to the Cabinet,3471.868,5.839
and get to know each other and talk about priorities.,3477.707,2.236
"I will say that -- it&amp;#39;s interesting,",3479.943,2.168
I mentioned Obamacare.,3482.111,1.102
When one of the things that was brought up by the,3483.213,2.602
"governors -- and I&amp;#39;ve got to be honest, I wasn&amp;#39;t",3485.815,1.802
picking which governors and thinking of party --,3487.617,1.668
but it came up over and over again that they,3489.285,2.069
actually -- several of them commented on how,3491.354,3.27
appreciative they have been in terms of seeking,3494.624,2.769
their input on not just healthcare but,3497.393,3.404
"infrastructure and Medicaid, in particular,",3500.797,2.936
and other areas that fall into their thing -- to,3503.733,3.07
their wheelhouse.,3506.803,0.667
"So I think -- just so we&amp;#39;re clear, the dialogue",3507.47,2.436
that exists between this administration and this,3509.906,5.305
President and governors I think is a very,3515.211,2.503
refreshing move forward.,3517.714,1.668
"The Press: And then my point -- a follow-up, a",3519.382,3.203
quick follow-up.,3522.585,0.668
I want to clarify a little bit of something that,3523.253,1.334
happened Thursday and Friday about the &amp;quot;public,3524.587,3.237
enemy&amp;quot; statement.,3527.824,0.967
Are you saying that all of the press is,3528.791,1.702
the public enemy?,3530.493,0.768
People who didn&amp;#39;t vote for the President?,3531.261,1.768
"Just the people in this room, or -- is it just",3533.029,2.703
Bill Maher and maybe Warren Beatty?,3535.732,1.635
Can you clarify what we&amp;#39;re talking about?,3537.367,2.969
Mr Spicer: I think the President made clear in,3540.336,1.335
his tweet that he was referring to the fake news,3541.671,2.069
and people who ascribe to pushing fake stories is,3543.74,6.907
where his target was.,3550.647,1.034
"The Press: Thanks a lot, Sean.",3551.681,0.968
"As you know, more than 60 Democrats either boycotted",3552.649,2.902
or skipped the President&amp;#39;s inauguration.,3555.551,1.569
What kind of reception do you think the President,3557.12,2.869
will get tomorrow evening from Democrats in the,3559.989,2.536
House and Senate when he gives his joint address?,3562.525,2.87
"Mr Spicer: Well, I hope a very robust and",3565.395,5.105
applause-filled reception.,3570.5,1.535
"The speech, as I mentioned, breaks down a",3572.035,3.67
lot of barriers that have traditionally been,3575.705,2.102
political barriers in terms of areas where I,3577.807,1.702
think we should find agreement that reaffirm,3579.509,4.237
the President&amp;#39;s desire to unite the country and,3583.746,1.936
unite our parties in areas of shared common ground.,3585.682,2.869
And I think the things that he&amp;#39;s talking about --,3588.551,3.837
"increasing the support to our military, our",3592.388,2.136
veterans; helping children get an education -- those,3594.524,3.937
are things that hopefully we can all come together,3598.461,2.569
"and think are shared American values,",3601.03,1.635
regardless of party.,3602.665,0.868
I hope that we see a tremendous amount of,3603.533,4.171
support for the President and his policies and his,3607.704,3.169
vision tomorrow night.,3610.873,0.901
"He recognizes the problems that our nation faces, but",3611.774,5.039
he also charts a vision forward.,3616.813,2.102
"And I think it&amp;#39;s one that if people are honest, that",3618.915,4.037
they will agree that it really isn&amp;#39;t a political,3622.952,2.97
agenda as much as an agenda for this country,3625.922,3.437
and one to move us forward.,3629.359,2.235
"So I think that we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see, but I can",3631.594,6.173
tell you that I think it will be a,3637.767,1.335
positive move forward.,3639.102,0.667
Zeke.,3639.769,0.667
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",3640.436,0.801
Couple follow-ups to Olivier&amp;#39;s question earlier,3641.237,1.935
about the ISIS review.,3643.172,1.068
It&amp;#39;s day 30.,3644.24,0.768
The memorandum the President signed 30 days,3645.008,2.268
ago said that he was supposed to be briefed.,3647.276,1.836
Can you give us a more -- a timeline on when,3649.112,3.236
specifically President Trump will be involved --,3652.348,2.136
I know you mentioned there&amp;#39;s a principals,3654.484,1.034
meeting earlier today -- what the timeline of the,3655.518,1.268
review is?,3656.786,1.168
"And then separately, you mentioned that Secretary",3657.954,1.968
Mattis was the one who&amp;#39;s presenting it to the,3659.922,1.268
principals committee.,3661.19,1.569
The memorandum included things other than just the,3662.759,2.202
military; it included public diplomacy efforts,3664.961,4.037
to cut off financial ties to ISIS.,3668.998,1.602
What were the other,3670.6,0.834
Cabinet secretaries involved?,3671.434,0.834
What is sort of -- what got us here and where do,3672.268,1.535
we go from here?,3673.803,0.567
Mr Spicer: Thank you.,3674.37,0.467
"Let me, if I may, get briefed on who and what",3674.837,3.17
occurred in the principals meeting to the extent that,3678.007,2.569
"it&amp;#39;s available, and I&amp;#39;d be glad to get back to you",3680.576,2.102
tomorrow on that.,3682.678,1.369
I just don&amp;#39;t have that information available.,3684.047,3.003
Gabi.,3687.05,1.334
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",3688.384,0.634
"Palm Beach County has said that it&amp;#39;s costing $60,000",3690.086,1.335
a day in overtime pay every time the President,3692.588,2.803
comes to visit West Palm Beach.,3695.391,2.236
He&amp;#39;s slated to go there again this weekend,3697.627,1.701
according to some reports.,3699.328,1.736
Is the President taking any steps to ensure that,3701.064,2.936
taxpayers aren&amp;#39;t saddled with tremendous costs in,3704,2.502
"his travel habits, considering he was so",3706.502,1.869
critical of his predecessor on,3708.371,2.502
that matter?,3710.873,1.368
"Mr Spicer: Well, Gabi, the security for the President",3712.241,4.438
and the First Family is set by the Secret Service.,3716.679,2.669
"As you know, they determine the security",3719.348,2.603
measures that need to be taken to protect the,3721.951,2.836
"President -- frankly, any President.",3724.787,2.469
So I&amp;#39;m going to leave it up to the Secret Service,3727.256,2.369
to decide what security measures and steps are,3729.625,3.204
taken to protect the President.,3732.829,2.002
"And, as you know, I mean, this -- depending on -- it",3734.831,2.669
transcends administrations.,3737.5,1.935
"Wherever the President goes, they need to make",3739.435,2.603
sure that the President and the First,3742.038,1.268
Family is safe.,3743.306,0.5
That&amp;#39;s something that I think -- we rely on the,3743.806,4.738
Secret Service to make those determinations.,3748.544,2.503
They continue to do a phenomenal job making sure,3751.047,2.335
that the First Family and the President and the Vice,3753.382,2.57
"President are protected, and we have full",3755.952,2.068
confidence in the decisions that they make.,3758.02,2.169
So thank you guys very much.,3760.189,1.769
We&amp;#39;ll have a briefing tomorrow -- later today,3761.958,0.667
on the state.,3762.625,3.203
The Press: Approximate time?,3765.828,0.634
Mr Spicer: What&amp;#39;s that?,3766.462,0.434
The Press: Approximate time?,3766.896,0.867
Mr Spicer: I would look in the 6 o&amp;#39;clock hour.,3767.763,1.736
The Press: Here?,3769.499,1.234

The Press: After 6:00?,3771.501,1.001
Mr Spicer: I get to see you here again.,3772.502,3.703
I would plan on around 6:00.,3776.205,1.402
We&amp;#39;ll have further guidance.,3777.607,1.935
And I don&amp;#39;t anticipate it being long.,3779.542,1.602
I think we&amp;#39;re just going to walk through the -- off,3781.144,1.568
camera.,3782.712,0.534
"We&amp;#39;ll walk through the themes of the speech, take",3783.246,2.235
"any questions, and then try to get some additional",3785.481,2.236
"information, depending on where the President is in",3787.717,2.469
his read-through.,3790.186,1.068
"The Press: No briefing tomorrow, right?",3791.254,1.201
Mr Spicer: No briefing tomorrow.,3792.455,1.268
"If you don&amp;#39;t want one, you don&amp;#39;t have to have one.",3793.723,1.868

If you guys want to vote,3800.563,1.168
"-- The Press: No, no, no,",3801.731,0.834
but tradition is there&amp;#39;s no briefing on -- that&amp;#39;s,3802.565,1.635
why I&amp;#39;m asking.,3804.2,0.5
Mr Spicer: I know.,3804.7,0.401
"We will do something for you, I promise. We ill make sure we --",3805.101,1.802
"The Press: Is it going to be a gaggle like last Friday, or is it",3806.903,0.967
going to be --,3808.604,0.467
"Mr Spicer: No, no, we will",3809.071,0.501
get back to you.,3809.572,0.567
I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ll see my face here tomorrow.,3810.139,2.136
