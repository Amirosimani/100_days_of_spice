"Mr. Spicer: Good afternoon, everyone.",0,1.835
Happy Friday.,1.835,0.667
It&amp;#39;s another busy day here at the White House and,2.502,3.003
across the Trump administration.,5.505,1.435
The first jobs report under the President&amp;#39;s,6.94,2.402
administration was released this morning.,9.342,2.569
"It&amp;#39;s National Wear Red Day, highlighting the",11.911,2.536
importance of preventing heart disease.,14.447,1.902
It&amp;#39;s National Catholic Schools Week.,16.349,1.335
And the President is going to be signing some,17.684,1.368
"executive orders, delivering some",19.052,1.368
much-needed regulatory relief to lenders and,20.42,1.335
borrowers in the next few minutes.,21.755,1.334
We&amp;#39;re finishing up the,23.089,0.668
second week here really strong.,23.757,0.667
"Yesterday, another great deal was reached with",24.424,1.335
Lockheed Martin for the purchase of a,25.759,1.334
new lot of F35s.,27.093,0.668
"Through the President&amp;#39;s intervention, a total of",27.761,1.368
90 planes -- for a lot of 90 planes; 55 were,29.129,1.334
purchased for U.S.,30.463,1.135
military that added up to a total of $455 million,31.598,5.005
savings for U.S.,39.706,5.439
"taxpayers from the previous lot, with an",45.145,6.373
"average cost reduction of 7.5 percent, another big",51.518,3.737
win that the President has delivered on,55.255,2.402
for U.S. taxpayers.,57.657,1.568
"Speaking of good numbers, let&amp;#39;s turn to",59.225,1.402
the jobs report.,60.627,0.867
"The economy added more than 227,000 new jobs,",61.494,4.138
"significantly more than the 175,000 that",65.632,2.836
had been expected.,68.468,1.301
Today&amp;#39;s report reflects the consumer confidence,69.769,2.369
that the Trump presidency has inspired.,72.138,4.171
"According to a recent Gallup poll, economic",76.309,2.102
"confidence is at a new high, and ADP showed",78.411,2.903
strong private sector hiring.,81.314,2.169
President Trump campaigned on how to make,83.483,1.535
America work again.,85.018,1.334
"Even before he took office, the markets knew",86.352,2.57
he would deliver on that promise.,88.922,1.835
The President&amp;#39;s already taken significant steps to,90.757,2.069
"turn our economy around, and he&amp;#39;s looking forward",92.826,2.502
to ensuring that every American who wants a,95.328,1.635
job has the opportunity to find one.,96.963,2.836
While the President is definitely pleased that,99.799,2.403
the job growth has far surpassed expectations and,102.202,2.836
"that the labor force participation is rising,",105.038,2.469
he also recognizes that there&amp;#39;s a lot,107.507,1.969
more work to be done.,109.476,1.568
The President has a big and bold agenda to,111.044,2.602
grow the U.S.,113.646,0.668
economy and to create jobs.,114.314,1.902
"In just his first two weeks in office, he&amp;#39;s met",116.216,2.569
with more than 50 business leaders across a vast,118.785,2.703
range of industries.,121.488,1.835
"This morning, the President participated in",123.323,1.668
a strategic and policy forum with business,124.991,2.002
leaders from some of our country&amp;#39;s most,126.993,2.769
successful companies.,129.762,1.535
The President understands the importance of an open,131.297,2.002
dialogue with fellow business leaders on how to,133.299,2.269
make the nation&amp;#39;s economy stronger.,135.568,2.636
His firsthand experience as a successful,138.204,3.137
businessman helps to guide his decisions as,141.341,2.235
"President, and he will continue to seek opinions",143.576,2.703
of other job creators while crafting an,146.279,1.735
economic agenda.,148.014,1.335
All of these meetings are focused on one primary,149.349,2.435
goal: Providing new and improved employment,151.784,2.536
opportunities for all Americans.,154.32,1.835
We&amp;#39;re looking at a full range of policy measures,156.155,2.57
"to achieve that goal: Regulatory relief, tax and",158.725,2.836
"trade reform, empowering women in the workplace,",161.561,2.536
"rebuilding America&amp;#39;s crumbling infrastructure,",164.097,2.369
and improving our education system.,166.466,2.169
"Also today, in pursuit of that goal, the President",168.635,2.269
will be signing two executive actions as part,170.904,2.202
of his plan to overhaul our financial and,173.106,2.068
regulatory system.,175.174,1.135
I expect that to happen closer to the,176.309,1.935
one o&amp;#39;clock hour.,178.244,1.268
The first is an executive order for proposing,179.512,2.002
guideline principles that sets the table for a,181.514,2.536
"regulatory system that mitigates risk, encourages",184.05,3.437
"growth, and more importantly,",187.487,1.968
protects consumers.,189.455,1.669
The Dodd-Frank Act is a disastrous policy that&amp;#39;s,191.124,3.069
"hindering our markets, reducing the availability",194.193,2.536
"of credit, and crippling our economy&amp;#39;s ability to",196.729,2.57
grow and create jobs.,199.299,1.935
It imposed hundreds of new regulations on financial,201.234,2.903
institutions while establishing unaccountable,204.137,1.868
and unconstitutional new agency that does not,206.005,5.172
adequately protect consumers.,211.177,1.869
"Perhaps worst of all, despite all of its",213.046,2.035
"overreaching, Dodd-Frank did not address the causes",215.081,2.936
"of the financial crisis, something we all",218.017,2.336
know must be done.,220.353,1.468
"It did not solve the &amp;quot;too big to fail,&amp;quot; and we must",221.821,2.903
determine conclusively that the failure of a,224.724,2.536
large bank will never again leave,227.26,1.501
taxpayers on the hook.,228.761,1.735
The presidential memorandum addresses the,230.496,1.669
burdens of government regulations and the,232.165,1.601
Department of Labor&amp;#39;s fiduciary rule.,233.766,2.636
The rule is a solution in search of a problem.,236.402,2.97
"There are better ways to protect investors, and the",239.372,1.902
Trump administration is taking action to do so.,241.274,2.636
We&amp;#39;re directing the Department of Labor to,243.91,1.635
review this rule.,245.545,1.234
The rule&amp;#39;s intent may be to have provided retirees,246.779,4.138
"and others with better financial advice, but in",250.917,2.302
"reality, its effect has been to limit the",253.219,2.569
financial services that are available to them.,255.788,3.237
President Trump does not intend to put unnecessary,259.025,2.502
limits on economic opportunity.,261.527,1.936
The Department of Labor exceeded its authority,263.463,1.968
"with this rule, and this is exactly the kind of",265.431,2.303
government regulatory overreach the President,267.734,2.235
was put into office to stop.,269.969,2.069
We desperately need to overhaul how we approach,272.038,2.135
financial regulation.,274.173,1.469
The President is taking action to protect American,275.642,1.968
taxpayers and get people back to work.,277.61,2.836
"Moving on, we announced earlier this week that we",280.446,2.269
would be taking steps to address Iran&amp;#39;s,282.715,2.169
recent actions.,284.884,1.201
"Today, the U.S.",286.085,0.701
sanctioned 25 individuals and entities that provide,286.786,2.97
support to Iran&amp;#39;s ballistic missile program,289.756,2.736
and the Islamic Revolutionary Qud Force.,292.492,2.469
These designations are in response to Iran&amp;#39;s ongoing,294.961,3.57
"ballistic missile program, including its ballistic",298.531,2.503
"missile test on January 29, 2017, as well as",301.034,3.47
Iran&amp;#39;s continued support for terrorism.,304.504,2.369
"We&amp;#39;ve taken these actions today, after careful",306.873,1.968
"consideration, and will continue to respond with",308.841,2.77
appropriate action.,311.611,1.601
These designations mark yet another stop in our,313.212,2.77
continued effort to aggressively target Iran&amp;#39;s,315.982,2.769
ballistic missile program,318.751,1.568
and terrorism-related activities.,320.319,2.436
"Over at the Department of Defense, Secretary Mattis",322.755,2.202
is on the final day of a two-day trip through Asia.,324.957,2.503
"He visited Korea yesterday and Japan today, returning",327.46,2.936
to Washington tomorrow.,330.396,1.468
Secretary Mattis&amp;#39; visit emphasizes the priority,331.864,2.97
"President Trump places on the Asia-Pacific, and on",334.834,2.669
strengthening the U.S.-Republic of Korea,337.503,2.102
alliance in the face of a growing North Korea,339.605,2.47
nuclear and ballistic missile threat.,342.075,2.268
"Over in the Senate, the President now has 11",344.343,2.303
Cabinet nominees awaiting a full Senate vote on,346.646,2.369
their confirmations.,349.015,1.268
We look forward to welcoming these,350.283,1.334
individuals into the administration.,351.617,2.103
"Regarding the weekend&amp;#39;s plans, the President will",353.72,2.035
debut his second weekly Facebook Live event this,355.755,3.57
evening at 5 o&amp;#39;clock.,359.325,1.735
You can expect him to recap another week of,361.06,1.669
action on behalf of the American people.,362.729,2.102
He&amp;#39;ll also comment on his selection of Judge Neil,364.831,2.269
Gorsuch to be the next Associate Justice,367.1,2.302
of the Supreme Court.,369.402,1.468
"And while recognizing Black History Month, he",370.87,1.802
will discuss his vision to deliver more opportunity,372.672,2.502
and safety for the African American community.,375.174,2.903
"One more note of this week&amp;#39;s address, the",378.077,2.102
lead-in to the President&amp;#39;s remark on Facebook Live,380.179,2.403
will feature some of the incredible artwork,382.582,2.002
throughout the White House that was created by,384.584,1.601
"African American artists, so you definitely don&amp;#39;t",386.185,1.969
want to miss this.,388.154,1.201
"As I mentioned previously, this weekend the President",389.355,2.469
will be shifting the operation of the White,391.824,1.702
House down to the &amp;quot;Winter White House&amp;quot;,393.526,1.768
at Mar-a-Lago.,395.294,1.235
"While in Florida, he&amp;#39;ll hold meetings and calls",396.529,1.902
with advisors and staff to plan for another big week,398.431,2.769
of action on behalf of the American people.,401.2,2.036
We&amp;#39;ll provide readouts of these as they occur.,403.236,2.502
"By our count, as of this morning, the",405.738,1.435
administration has already racked up more than 60,407.173,2.369
"significant actions -- 21 executive actions, 16",409.542,3.67
"meetings with foreign leaders, and 10",413.212,1.902
"stakeholder meetings, to name a few.",415.114,2.636
We&amp;#39;re looking forward to another productive,417.75,2.069
week next week.,419.819,1.335
"On Monday, the President will visit Central Command",421.154,2.102
and Special Operations Command Headquarters at,423.256,1.868
MacDill Air Force Base.,425.124,1.568
"While at MacDill, the President will receive",426.692,1.769
"command briefings from both CENTCOM and SOCOM,",428.461,2.402
"have lunch with the enlisted troops, and have",430.863,2.269
an all-hands address to personnel.,433.132,2.936
General Dunford and General Flynn will also be,436.068,2.269
"present for the meetings, and the President will",438.337,1.569
return to Washington that evening.,439.906,1.968
"With that, I&amp;#39;m going to go my first",441.874,1.368
Skype question seat.,443.242,1.068
Jackie Nespral from NBC 6 in South,444.31,2.87
Florida. Jackie.,447.18,1.067
Jackie Nespral: Go afternoon.,448.247,2.803
"On behalf of the viewers of South Florida, thanks",451.05,2.569
so much for this opportunity.,453.619,1.502
"You know, a lot of focus on foreign affairs this",455.121,1.702
"week, a new sanctions announced today against",456.823,2.002
"Iran, and of course Miami, as you know, is home to",458.825,2.469
the largest Cuban-American community in the country.,461.294,2.569
"And during the campaign, President Trump talked",463.863,1.702
about his discontent with the warming of U.S.-Cuba,465.565,2.269
relations implemented by President Obama.,467.834,2.535
"And in the last days of his administration, he",470.369,2.102
"ended the &amp;quot;wet foot, dry foot&amp;quot; policy, leaving",472.471,1.802
thousands of Cubans in limbo.,474.273,1.569
So my question is twofold: Has there been any contact,475.842,3.169
between your administration and the,479.011,1.335
Cuban government?,480.346,1.468
Are there any plans to change the current,481.814,1.802
policy right now?,483.616,0.834
"Mr. Spicer: Thanks, Jackie.",484.45,1.135
We are in the midst of a full review of all U.S.,485.585,4.471
policies towards Cuba.,490.056,1.234
The President is committed to an agenda of ensuring,491.29,3.337
human rights for all,494.627,3.103
citizens throughout the world.,497.73,1.168
"And as we review those policies in Cuba, that",498.898,3.003
"will be forefront in their policy discussions, but",501.901,3.503
there is nothing that we have on that,505.404,1.335
front at this point.,506.739,1.335
Francesca Chambers.,508.074,0.934
"Francesca Chambers: Thank you, Sean.",509.008,2.102
"Today, the United States put new sanctions on Iran.",511.11,3.804
"Previously, this morning, the President had said",514.914,2.536
that they were playing with fire.,517.45,1.368
You said that appropriate actions would continue,518.818,2.069
to be taken.,520.887,0.9
Is this the full extent of the punishing actions that,521.787,2.97
we&amp;#39;re seeing right now?,524.757,1.168
And are military options still on the table in,525.925,2.669
response to the administration saying that,528.594,1.769
all options are on the table?,530.363,1.801
Mr. Spicer: Thanks for the question.,532.164,1.769
I think one of the things that the President has,533.933,2.202
"said throughout the campaign, during the",536.135,1.935
"transition, and since becoming President is that",538.07,2.67
he doesn&amp;#39;t like to telegraph his options.,540.74,2.202
That&amp;#39;s how he believes that you can have a much,542.942,1.969
greater successful option.,544.911,1.034
"So I&amp;#39;m not going to go into the full extent, and",545.945,1.735
"I think today&amp;#39;s sanctions really represent a very,",547.68,4.204
very strong stand against the actions that Iran has,551.884,3.337
been taking and make it very clear that the deal,555.221,3.503
that they struck previously was not in the,558.724,2.77
"best interest of this country, and that",561.494,1.768
President Trump is going to do everything he can to,563.262,2.503
make sure that Iran is stayed in check.,565.765,1.468
The Press: So it is possible that there are,567.233,1.501
"more actions coming, though?",568.734,0.901
Mr. Spicer: I would never rule anything,569.635,1.969
off the table.,571.604,0.667
I think the President&amp;#39;s made it clear throughout,572.271,1.568
his time that that&amp;#39;s what going to happen.,573.839,2.803
"The Press: Thanks a lot, Sean.",576.642,2.069
I wanted to ask about one of the members that has,578.711,5.005
been announced as being part of President Trump&amp;#39;s,587.586,1.936
team -- it&amp;#39;s Gina Haspel.,589.522,1.234
Senator Ron Wyden has written to the President,590.756,1.936
saying that her background makes her unsuitable to be,592.692,2.168
"the CIA Deputy Director, and he was specifically",594.86,2.937
referencing was her role in the enhanced,597.797,3.336
interrogation program that the CIA had during the,601.133,3.204
course of the Bush administration.,604.337,2.002
Do you believe that this background is a,606.339,3.169
disqualifier for that position?,609.508,1.602
Mr. Spicer: I think she has had an unbelievably,611.11,2.603
distinguished career as a covert operative.,613.713,2.302
"She, basically, gave up that to come out and serve",616.015,5.906
in this role at the request of Director,621.921,2.569
"Pompeo, and I think she has been a very, very",624.49,3.103
distinguished servant to the American people and is,627.593,3.137
highly qualified for that position.,630.73,1.835
"Next, I&amp;#39;m going to go to Josh McElveen over at --",632.565,3.236
from WMUR in New Hampshire.,635.801,2.102
"Josh McElveen: Hey, Sean,",637.903,1.902
thanks for taking the question.,639.805,0.834
I know you&amp;#39;re looking forward to the Patriots,640.639,1.335
coming down in a couple of months -- a lot of people,641.974,1.368
up here are hoping that happens as well.,643.342,1.735
"Getting to business, though, for more than two",645.077,1.869
"years, the number-one public health and safety",646.946,1.968
threat facing this state is the heroin and,648.914,2.303
opioid crisis.,651.217,0.901
"During the campaign, the President promised to be",652.118,2.702
swift and aggressive when it came to this problem --,654.82,2.102
stopping the flow of drugs coming across the border.,656.922,2.369
"Increasingly, though, the problem lies in synthetic",659.291,2.737
fentanyl is being cooked up in labs,662.028,1.601
in the northeast.,663.629,1.235
What is the administration doing on that front as,664.864,2.135
well as the treatment aspect of addiction?,666.999,2.336
"And, secondly, if I may, with the understanding it",669.335,2.469
"is a state issue, New Hampshire is poised to",671.804,1.602
"become a &amp;quot;right to work&amp;quot; state, but the vote is",673.406,1.901
expected to be close.,675.307,1.535
Given the administration&amp;#39;s favorable view of &amp;quot;right,676.842,2.203
"to work,&amp;quot; is it actively engaged in that effort?",679.045,2.335
"And if not, what is the general message from",681.38,1.802
the White House?,683.182,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Thanks, Josh.",683.849,1.035
"First, on the opioid crisis, that is a major",684.884,3.904
problem for not just New Hampshire but for so many,688.788,1.868
states across the country.,690.656,1.735
I think one of the things beyond the health issue is,692.391,5.005
to make sure that we&amp;#39;re looking at borders use.,697.396,2.102
And the flow of heroin through our southern,699.498,2.336
border is something that the President obviously,701.834,3.036
takes -- that&amp;#39;s part of his whole strong,704.87,2.269
"immigration stance, strong border security, having",707.139,2.536
"that wall built, having additional assets on the",709.675,1.902
southern border will go a long way to stem the flow,711.577,2.803
of illegal drugs into the country from our southern,714.38,2.469
border up through the states.,716.849,1.935
"It was obviously, as you mentioned, a big issue",718.784,1.769
that he made in New Hampshire throughout the,720.553,1.902
"primary and continued so in the campaign, and",722.455,2.402
that&amp;#39;s kind of something that as soon as Tom Price,724.857,2.536
"and others are confirmed throughout the department,",727.393,3.904
"this has got a health component to it, it&amp;#39;s got",731.297,1.601
a border issue to it.,732.898,1.535
So there is a multi-government approach,734.433,2.736
that needs to be taken to the opioid crisis.,737.169,2.036
"With respect to right to work, I think you",739.205,3.67
accurately portrayed it.,742.875,1.235
The President believes in right to work.,744.11,2.836
He wants to give workers and companies the,746.946,3.236
flexibility to do what&amp;#39;s in the best interest for,750.182,1.869
job creators.,752.051,1.468
"Obviously, the Vice President has been a",753.519,1.702
champion of this as well.,755.221,1.001
It&amp;#39;s something that is a big deal in Indiana and,756.222,3.67
something that he has championed as well. Blake.,759.892,2.836
"Blake: Sean, I want to ask you about Dodd-Frank.",762.728,2.069
Mr. Spicer: Yeah.,764.797,1.201
Blake: Beyond the executive order that&amp;#39;s,765.998,2.402
"going to be signed here momentarily, is the",768.4,3.204
administration planning on or working with Congress,771.604,2.269
to overturn certain portions of the law itself,773.873,2.602
that can be done with an executive order?,776.475,2.603
"If so, what might that be?",779.078,1.935
What might that timeline be?,781.013,1.635
And can you say if a full repeal of Dodd-Frank is,782.648,3.57
actively being considered or not?,786.218,1.635
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think there&amp;#39;s two",787.853,1.902
aspects of this.,789.755,0.768
"There&amp;#39;s the administrative piece, which he&amp;#39;s starting",790.523,2.002
"to address through executive action, and then",792.525,2.836
there&amp;#39;s a legislative piece that I think we&amp;#39;re,795.361,1.334
going to work with Congress on.,796.695,1.068
"But, I mean, I think I&amp;#39;d go back to what I said",797.763,2.169
earlier -- that Dodd-Frank has been both a disaster,799.932,4.438
"in terms of the impact that it&amp;#39;s had, but also it",804.37,2.335
hasn&amp;#39;t achieved the goal.,806.705,1.635
And I think that there&amp;#39;s no question that the,808.34,2.002
"President talked about this extensively, the",810.342,1.836
"impact that it&amp;#39;s had, and it&amp;#39;s not an either-or.",812.178,4.738
"It&amp;#39;s, frankly, just not doing what it",816.916,1.735
set out to do.,818.651,1.268
And so I think we&amp;#39;re going to continue not just to,819.919,2.035
"act through administrative action, but through",821.954,4.671
working with Congress and,826.625,0.868
figuring out a legislative fix.,827.493,0.967
Major Garrett.,828.46,1.168
"Major Garrett: Sean, meeting with the",829.628,1.368
Australian ambassador here yesterday with Chief of,830.996,2.336
Staff Priebus and Steve Bannon -- can you describe,833.332,2.536
what that meeting was about?,835.868,1.601
And did the administration make a commitment -- which,837.469,2.903
we heard from the State Department yesterday --,840.372,2.903
"that, in fact, all of those subject to the Obama",843.275,3.671
administration agreement are still possible refugee,846.946,2.168
re-settlers just with extreme vetting or some,849.114,2.57
sort of process?,851.684,1.101
What was communicated?,852.785,1.067
"And on the Iran sanctions, Adam Szubin is the Acting",853.852,2.67
Treasury Secretary.,856.522,0.867
"He was, of course, in charge of sanctions at the",857.389,2.903
Treasury Department before.,860.292,1.602
Oftentimes these are a long time in development.,861.894,1.768
Were these sanctions something that were kind,863.662,2.236
"of on his desk or had been identified, and that&amp;#39;s",865.898,3.203
"what made them so, if not easy, available to",869.101,2.87
enact so rapidly?,871.971,0.967
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, I think those are -- I think you",872.938,2.369
"correctly pointed out -- I mean, he served in the",875.307,2.169
last administration.,877.476,1.068
"These kind of sanctions don&amp;#39;t happen quickly, but",878.544,3.87
I think the timing of them was clearly in reaction to,882.414,2.369
what we&amp;#39;ve seen over the last couple days.,884.783,2.903
We knew we had these options available to us,887.686,2.169
because they had been worked through the,889.855,1.402
"process, but we acted swiftly and decisively",891.257,3.703
today because the timing was right.,894.96,1.802
"So, you know, they were in the pipeline, they had",896.762,2.369
"been staffed and approved, and the President made the",899.131,2.569
decision that now was the time to do it based,901.7,1.702
on recent action.,903.402,0.667
Chief of Staff Priebus and Chief Strategist Bannon,904.069,5.439
did meet with the Prime Minister yesterday.,909.508,1.368
I think they had a very productive --,910.876,1.535
Male Speaker: Th ambassador.,912.411,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Th ambassador.,913.078,0.668
Thank you.,913.746,0.667
Appreciate the correction.,914.413,0.667
They did have a very productive and candid,915.08,2.436
conversation.,917.516,1.001
We have a tremendous amount of respect for the,918.517,2.169
"people of Australia, for Prime Minister Turnbull,",920.686,2.836
and it was a follow-up on the call.,923.522,1.702
But we&amp;#39;re going to,925.224,0.667
continue to work through this.,925.891,0.667
We&amp;#39;re going to honor the commitments that we&amp;#39;ve,926.558,1.335
"made in some way, meaning that we are going to vet",927.893,1.368
these people in accordance,929.261,0.667
with the agreement that happened.,929.928,1.335
And we&amp;#39;ll continue to have further updates as we,931.263,1.335
do. John Roberts.,932.598,2.035
"John Roberts: Sean, your statement last night on",934.633,5.639
settlements in Israel -- has there been,940.272,3.904
a shift in U.S. policy?,944.176,1.335
While you said that you didn&amp;#39;t think that they,945.511,1.635
"were helpful to achieving peace, you also didn&amp;#39;t",947.146,2.802
"think that they were an impediment to peace, which",949.948,2.436
would represent a departure from both,952.384,1.402
Obama and Bush.,953.786,0.867
And there was no reaffirmation of a,954.653,3.704
two-state solution in that statement.,958.357,2.035
So where are you on that?,960.392,1.535
Mr. Spicer: The President is committed to peace --,961.927,3.404
that&amp;#39;s his goal.,965.331,1.201
And I think when the President and Prime,966.532,2.169
"Minister Netanyahu meet here on the 15th, that",968.701,2.369
will obviously be the topic on that.,971.07,2.235
"At the end of the day, the goal is peace, and I think",973.305,3.604
that&amp;#39;s what you have to keep in mind.,976.909,1.601
I think that is going to be a subject that they,978.51,1.902
"discuss when they meet on the 15th, and that&amp;#39;s as",980.412,2.803
far as I want to go on that.,983.215,1.034
"The Press: Sean, if I can",984.249,1.068
go back to the settlement thing.,985.317,1.468
What is your position on settlements in terms of,986.785,4.605
"whether or not they -- I mean, you said that they",991.39,2.836
"were not an impediment to peace, but you also don&amp;#39;t",994.226,2.636
want them building new ones?,996.862,1.034
Mr. Spicer: Right.,997.896,0.668
The Press: So where are you on this?,998.564,1.334
"Mr. Spicer: Right, I mean, I think the statement is",999.898,1.335
very clear about that.,1001.233,0.667
We don&amp;#39;t believe that the existence of current,1001.9,1.368
"settlements is an impediment to peace, but I",1003.268,2.403
think the construction or expansion of existing,1005.671,2.235
settlements beyond the current borders is not,1007.906,2.102
going to be helpful moving forward. Trey.,1010.008,1.936
Trey: Two for you.,1011.944,0.734
Seventeen members of Congress requested that,1012.678,2.135
President Trump not interfere with the current,1014.813,2.036
way unemployment is calculated by the,1016.849,1.601
Department of Labor.,1018.45,0.734
Does the President intend,1019.184,1.235
to comply with their request?,1020.419,1.535
"And a related question -- how many of the 227,000",1021.954,3.637
jobs added to the U.S.,1025.591,1.101
in January does the President attribute to his,1026.692,3.303
administration versus the Obama administration?,1029.995,2.136
"Mr. Spicer: I think, look, when you look at the",1032.131,3.136
"confidence indexes, I&amp;#39;m not going to get into --",1035.267,3.537
"unfortunately, we don&amp;#39;t",1038.804,0.767
have that kind of a breakdown.,1039.571,1.468
I think that you&amp;#39;ve seen the action that he&amp;#39;s,1041.039,2.57
"taken, whether it&amp;#39;s Carrier or some of the",1043.609,1.535
other companies -- Sprint and SoftBank.,1045.144,2.269
"Clearly, there is a desire for companies to want to",1047.413,3.003
come be part of this Trump agenda and build and,1050.416,2.202
"manufacture, create jobs, bring jobs back.",1052.618,3.17
But I&amp;#39;m not at liberty to start parsing the BLS and,1055.788,3.937
other reports as far as where that comes down.,1059.725,3.37
"But look, his team, led by Gary Cohn, was really",1063.095,3.07
pleased with the numbers this morning.,1066.165,1.334
"Obviously, we&amp;#39;re pleased that we&amp;#39;re -- 227,000 jobs",1067.499,4.004
is a great kickoff.,1071.503,2.269
We hope they get better.,1073.772,0.868
"We know that there&amp;#39;s a lot more work to do, and",1074.64,2.002
that&amp;#39;s why the President continues to meet with,1076.642,1.501
"business leaders, union leaders to help figure out",1078.143,2.303
how we can grow the economy.,1080.446,1.067
"Yeah, Ashley.",1081.513,0.701
Ashley: The government revealed in an Alexandria,1082.214,2.636
"court case today that over 100,000 visas have now",1084.85,2.669
been revoked as part of,1087.519,1.769
the President&amp;#39;s travel ban.,1089.288,1.401
Does that include visa holders who are already in,1090.689,2.169
the United States?,1092.858,0.667
And will the government begin finding them and,1093.525,1.669
trying to deport them?,1095.194,0.834
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;ll have to get back to you on that.,1096.028,2.035
I don&amp;#39;t have all the details on that right now.,1098.063,1.769
"The Press: Six hours ago, the President tweeted that",1099.832,2.669
"professional anarchists, thugs, and paid protestors",1102.501,2.336
are proving the point of millions of people who,1104.837,2.602
voted to make America great again.,1107.439,1.802
Does the administration have any intention of,1109.241,1.768
investigating the groups who have been rioting at,1111.009,1.936
conservative or pro-Trump events?,1112.945,1.434
Mr. Spicer: I think we know who they are.,1114.379,1.769
I don&amp;#39;t know that we need to do an investigation. Yeah.,1116.148,2.002
The Press: Has the President seen the letter,1118.15,3.503
sent from Senator McCain yesterday?,1121.653,1.836
"And if so, is he looking into arming",1123.489,2.469
the Ukrainians?,1125.958,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know.,1126.625,0.901
I&amp;#39;ll have to get back to you on that. Charlie.,1127.526,3.136
Charlie: Ambassador Nikki Haley came out with a,1130.662,3.504
strong statement --,1134.166,0.801
Mr. Spicer: Yes.,1134.967,0.8
Charlie: -- on Russia yesterday.,1135.767,1.335
Does the administration have plans to keep the,1137.102,2.77
"sanctions against Russia in place, or do they have",1139.872,2.402
any intention of adding more sanctions?,1142.274,1.835
Mr. Spicer: So there&amp;#39;s two things: I think I,1144.109,2.202
commented the other day on the sanctions that,1146.311,3.003
Treasury put out.,1149.314,1.035
"Those are, in fact, routine -- or the",1150.349,2.169
clarification -- they are a routine clarification,1152.518,2.502
that occurs.,1155.02,1.001
"With respect to the sanctions, I think",1156.021,2.603
Ambassador Haley made it very clear of our concern,1158.624,2.669
with Russia&amp;#39;s occupation of Crimea.,1161.293,2.302
We are not -- and so I think she spoke very,1163.595,3.37
forcefully and clearly on that.,1166.965,1.402
"If I can, I&amp;#39;d like to",1168.367,0.834
go to the third Skype question.,1169.201,1.568
Christopher Sign from ABC15 in Arizona.,1170.769,2.236
"Christopher Sign: Sean, thank you for doing this.",1173.005,2.102
Hello from a sunny and beautiful Phoenix.,1175.107,1.935
With the likely confirmation on the,1177.042,1.635
"horizon with a new Veteran Affairs Secretary, there",1178.677,3.77
has been discussion,1182.447,1.001
regarding privatizing the VA.,1183.448,2.67
There&amp;#39;s also still concerns regarding wait,1186.118,1.902
"times, even overall care and some reports regarding",1188.02,3.003
the suicide rate.,1191.023,1.301
What is the reform that the administration,1192.324,2.669
is seeking here?,1194.993,1.101
"Also, will the administration",1196.094,1.702
protect whistleblowers?,1197.796,1.168
Second part of the question -- we&amp;#39;ve seen,1198.964,2.135
"protests here in Phoenix,",1201.099,1.335
as in the nationwide as well.,1202.434,1.869
"When you talk about unity, what is the administration",1204.303,2.702
"doing to bring more unity to the nation, and",1207.005,3.671
even more transparency?,1210.676,1.234
"As here in Phoenix, we saw",1211.91,1.368
that secret meeting on the tarmac.,1213.278,1.935
We talked about how is the administration,1215.213,1.936
repairing all of this?,1217.149,1.401
"Mr. Spicer: Thanks, Chris.",1218.55,1.602
"First, I mean, I think the President, mostly through",1220.152,3.57
"deed, continues to show that he wants to bring",1223.722,1.935
"people together in this country, figure out how to",1225.657,3.504
"move the country forward, both economically, job-wise.",1229.161,2.869
I think that is something that he continues to,1232.03,1.435
show a desire for.,1233.465,1.368
He talked about it in his inaugural address and,1234.833,1.969
the prayer breakfast.,1236.802,1.902
So I think he&amp;#39;s going to continue to show through,1238.704,2.002
both word and deed his desire to move,1240.706,2.035
the country forward.,1242.741,0.734
I&amp;#39;m trying to think -- can,1243.475,1.502
you go back to the first part?,1244.977,1.401
Christopher Sign: That&amp;#39;s all right -- the,1246.378,1.501
confirmation -- the likely confirmation of the,1247.879,1.368
VA Secretary?,1249.247,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: Oh yeah, Dr. Shulkin.",1249.915,1.368
"Yeah, look, I think first and foremost on VA reform,",1251.283,3.67
"you know, the number one thing is to get",1254.953,1.535
Dr. Shulkin confirmed.,1256.488,1.702
"And so many of these, as I brought up in the past",1258.19,3.036
"couple days, it&amp;#39;s hard to talk about how we&amp;#39;re going",1261.226,1.902
to enact an agenda of reform when Senate,1263.128,4.171
Democrats continue to,1267.299,1.001
slow-walk some of these folks.,1268.3,1.268
And I think that&amp;#39;s a big problem.,1269.568,1.568
Dr. Shulkin is the right individual to reform the,1271.136,3.036
VA -- to understand whether it&amp;#39;s lending or,1274.172,1.635
"medical care, the problems and the challenges that we",1275.807,2.403
face at the VA.,1278.21,1.234
These are people who have served our nation and,1279.444,1.802
"deserve the best care they can get, whether that&amp;#39;s",1281.246,2.403
"the mortgage lending, health care, or the",1283.649,2.235
variety of other stuff that the VA serves or,1285.884,2.503
provides to our veterans.,1288.387,1.368
And I think that what the President has done is talk,1289.755,3.136
to people like Dr. Toby Cusgrove at Cleveland,1292.891,2.002
Clinic and other business leaders about providing a,1294.893,2.77
better approach to serving the needs of our veterans.,1297.663,2.602
"Right now, you&amp;#39;re right, there are still wait times",1300.265,2.169
that are unacceptable.,1302.434,0.867
There&amp;#39;s care that&amp;#39;s unacceptable.,1303.301,1.569
"We&amp;#39;ve got to address that, and he&amp;#39;s going to",1304.87,2.202
continue to do it.,1307.072,0.767
David Jackson.,1307.839,0.768
"David Jackson: Sean, during the campaign,",1308.607,1.468
candidate Trump repeatedly said he was going to void,1310.075,2.102
the Iranian nuclear deal.,1312.177,0.934
Mr. Spicer: Right.,1313.111,0.701
David Jackson: Bottom line -- is he going to do,1313.812,1.435
"that, or is he going to let it stay?",1315.247,1.334
Mr. Spicer: I think today&amp;#39;s action speaks for,1316.581,1.335
itself in terms of the sanctions.,1317.916,1.335
"He&amp;#39;s made it very, very clear, David, that the",1319.251,1.334
"deal that was struck was a bad deal, that we gave",1320.585,1.368
Iran too much and we got too little for it.,1321.953,1.335
And I think that he is going to continue to be,1323.288,1.802
tough on Iran in a way that wasn&amp;#39;t done in the,1325.09,2.502
last eight years.,1327.592,0.668
I think today&amp;#39;s actions and the way that we,1328.26,6.339
expedited those sanctions are another example of how,1334.599,3.737
he&amp;#39;s going to stay tough on them.,1338.336,1.335
Let me go to the fourth Skype seat.,1339.671,1.435
Dale Jackson from WVNN,1341.106,1.268
"Talk Radio in Huntsville, Alabama.",1342.374,1.335
"Dale Jackson: Sean, thank you very much for taking",1343.709,1.334
questions from outside the elite media bubble there,1345.043,1.335
in D.C. My question is about immigration.,1346.378,1.335
"Donald Trump made this the forefront of his campaign,",1347.713,1.334
"the foundation of it, yet the DACA and DAPA",1349.047,1.335
programs still exist.,1350.382,5.005
And I learned from a member of Congress,1360.926,1.835
yesterday that the Trump administration is still,1362.761,2.636
issuing work permits that (inaudible) individuals.,1365.397,3.303
"Question one is, when are these programs",1368.7,2.436
going to be ended?,1371.136,1.234
"And question two, when will they stop issuing",1372.37,2.269
work permits to these individuals?,1374.639,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: Well, thanks, Dale.",1375.974,1.602
"I think, as you know, Secretary Kelly just",1377.576,2.836
assumed office.,1380.412,0.667
We are reviewing these programs.,1381.079,1.468
We&amp;#39;ve made it very clear that we&amp;#39;ll have further,1382.547,3.47
updates on immigration both with referring to,1386.017,2.737
DACA and DAPA.,1388.754,1.134
The President has made significant progress on,1389.888,3.237
addressing the pledge that he made to the American,1393.125,1.668
people regarding immigration problems that,1394.793,2.369
"we face, and I think we&amp;#39;re going to see more action",1397.162,2.336
on that in the next few weeks.,1399.498,1.234
"Yes, sir.",1400.732,0.667
"The Press: Sean, yesterday the President described",1401.399,3.337
NAFTA as a catastrophe.,1404.736,1.301
"We&amp;#39;ve heard about his concerns with Mexico, but",1406.037,2.903
I&amp;#39;m wondering if you can outline some of the,1408.94,2.303
"irritants that he finds along the Canadian border,",1411.243,3.103
and if there&amp;#39;s any talk of a meeting with Prime,1414.346,2.769
Minister Trudeau?,1417.115,0.834
Mr. Spicer: He has spoken to Prime Minister Trudeau.,1417.949,2.436
I know that they&amp;#39;re looking at setting up a,1420.385,1.668
time to come down.,1422.053,1.135
We&amp;#39;ve been in constant contact with Canadian,1423.188,2.069
"officials, and I think that will be a meeting",1425.257,1.601
that is set up very shortly. Sarah.,1426.858,1.335
"Sarah: Thanks, Sean.",1428.193,2.002
Russia&amp;#39;s foreign minister has pressed the,1430.195,4.271
administration for further details on the President&amp;#39;s,1434.466,3.804
plans to establish safe zones in Syria.,1438.27,1.334
The President has said to have discussed this,1439.604,1.569
yesterday with King Abdullah.,1441.173,0.8
When can we expect further details on that plan?,1441.973,1.769
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s a good question.,1443.742,1.601
I think that we are -- as you noted in the readouts,1445.343,2.436
"from last weekend, that has been a subject that",1447.779,1.902
has come up with all of the Middle East leaders,1449.681,2.503
that he&amp;#39;s talked about.,1452.184,1.501
It&amp;#39;s an area that he feels strongly about.,1453.685,2.236
And I think as he continues to have,1455.921,1.835
"follow-up conversations,",1457.756,1.168
we can expect further details.,1458.924,1.568
It&amp;#39;s something that -- Secretary Tillerson,1460.492,1.802
obviously just got sworn into office -- that there,1462.294,2.335
will be further follow-up on that. Yeah.,1464.629,1.702
The Press: The President will meet with Japanese,1466.331,3.303
Prime Minister Abe next Friday.,1469.634,1.468
Mr. Spicer: Yes.,1471.102,0.901
The Press: So what&amp;#39;s the main topic,1472.003,1.702
for the meeting?,1473.705,0.667
Will the President tell Japanese Prime Minister,1474.372,3.971
Abe that Japan should pay more and pick up all the,1478.343,4.638
expense to use military (inaudible) in Japan?,1482.981,2.502
Mr. Spicer: I think there&amp;#39;s going to be a lot,1485.483,1.635
of both trade and national security.,1487.118,2.737
"I think as we get closer to that meeting, I&amp;#39;ll have",1489.855,1.701
further information on it.,1491.556,1.035
"But right now, as you can imagine, there&amp;#39;s an",1492.591,1.835
"economic aspect to this, and then there&amp;#39;s a",1494.426,2.369
national security aspect to this. Glenn.,1496.795,1.668
"Glenn: Sean, you have referenced polls a couple",1498.463,2.369
"of times from the podium, but a poll came out today",1500.832,2.536
-- CBS says the President,1503.368,1.468
has a 40 percent approval rating.,1504.836,1.468
We&amp;#39;ve seen the approval rating drop during the,1506.304,2.169
transition period.,1508.473,0.667
He talked about polls a great deal,1509.14,2.036
during the campaign.,1511.176,0.967
A) What do you think that says about the way the,1512.143,1.936
American people are looking at these actions,1514.079,1.768
that he&amp;#39;s taking?,1515.847,0.801
B) What do you think it says about his pledge to,1516.648,1.668
unite the country on the eve of his election?,1518.316,1.969
Mr. Spicer: I think there&amp;#39;s also a Rasmussen,1520.285,1.835
poll that showed he had,1522.12,0.734
a 51 percent approval rating.,1522.854,1.702
You had an Ipsos/Reuters poll that other day that,1524.556,2.069
"showed -- and again, I don&amp;#39;t have it handy, but a",1526.625,2.702
majority of people approved --,1529.327,1.168
(Inaudible) those.,1530.495,1.402
Mr. Spicer: I understand that.,1531.897,1.234
And I think that as the President&amp;#39;s policies,1533.131,1.935
"continue to get enacted, for all the hysteria",1535.066,2.67
regarding his efforts to protect the country -- on,1537.736,3.203
those seven countries where we didn&amp;#39;t have the,1540.939,2.669
proper vetting in place to ensure that the American,1543.608,2.269
people were safe -- what we did have was a very,1545.877,3.237
high response from the American people in,1549.114,1.735
support of that.,1550.849,0.867
His policies continue to do it.,1551.716,1.468
"The President understands this is a marathon,",1553.184,1.569
not a sprint.,1554.753,1.001
"And as he continues to get people back to work,",1555.754,2.702
"protect this country, I think the poll numbers",1558.456,2.102
will act in accord. Jeff.,1560.558,0.968
"Jeff: Sean, you mentioned the Consumer Financial",1561.526,2.202
Protection Bureau.,1563.728,0.668
Does the administration intend to keep Richard,1564.396,2.135
Cordray as the head of that agency?,1566.531,2.202
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t have a staff announcement on the,1568.733,4.171
"CFPB right now, but we&amp;#39;ll see where we go.",1572.904,1.602
"The Press: You criticize the bureau broadly, but do",1574.506,2.202
you want to see it stay in place?,1576.708,1.335
Mr. Spicer: I think we&amp;#39;ll have further,1578.043,1.334
updates on that.,1579.377,1.135
That&amp;#39;s an area that we need to work,1580.512,1.334
with Congress on. April.,1581.846,1.135
"April: Okay, Sean, two things: You said something",1582.981,2.302
about President Trump talking on the,1585.283,2.503
Facebook Live --,1587.786,1.101
Mr. Spicer: Right.,1588.887,1.101
"April: -- whenever he is doing the address, that he",1589.988,3.67
was going to talk about Black History Month and,1593.658,3.337
issues pertaining to,1596.995,1.101
the African American community.,1598.096,1.468
"When you first came, a couple days into the",1599.564,3.337
"administration, I asked you about the agenda, the",1602.901,2.936
black agenda that he had possibly formulated or he,1605.837,3.303
was formulating as he came out maybe the day before,1609.14,3.204
"with the issue of Chicago, or the day after --",1612.344,2.802
something around that time -- Chicago and sending the,1615.146,2.503
Feds in if it doesn&amp;#39;t change.,1617.649,1.668
Has he now formulated a plan to deal with the,1619.317,2.469
"black community, not just with issues",1621.786,2.703
of law and order?,1624.489,1.401
What is that --,1625.89,1.469
"Mr. Spicer: I mean, he had a meeting with African",1627.359,3.036
American leaders the other day in the Roosevelt Room.,1630.395,1.768
"I think part of this is, to your point, it isn&amp;#39;t",1632.163,1.402
"just law and order -- it&amp;#39;s jobs, it&amp;#39;s education, it&amp;#39;s",1633.565,2.536
"health care, small business lending.",1636.101,2.569
"There&amp;#39;s a lot that goes along with that agenda,",1638.67,1.535
and I think part of these business meetings they,1640.205,2.502
have are about hiring and,1642.707,1.735
small business and job creation.,1644.442,1.402
"All of those issues, I think, are at the",1645.844,1.635
forefront of small business --,1647.479,1.902
or that community.,1649.381,1.468
So it&amp;#39;s not just a single thing.,1650.849,1.801
"I think that there&amp;#39;s a lot, whether it&amp;#39;s crime",1652.65,3.871
"and law and order, or education, health care,",1656.521,2.669
"small business, job creation, that impacts",1659.19,2.203
"that entire segment of the population, whether",1661.393,2.736
they&amp;#39;re living in a rural part of the country,1664.129,2.068
or an inner city.,1666.197,0.968
And I think that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s really focused,1667.165,2.202
on right now.,1669.367,0.668
"April: Wait, I&amp;#39;m not finished.",1670.035,1.368
Mr. Spicer: Okay.,1671.403,0.934
April: So he&amp;#39;s now formulating the agenda?,1672.337,2.469
Mr. Spicer: Absolutely.,1674.806,0.767
April: Okay.,1675.573,0.668
So the second question -- CVE.,1676.241,1.334
What&amp;#39;s on the table for that?,1677.575,1.535
Mr. Spicer: We&amp;#39;re not getting -- I have nothing,1679.11,2.236
to announce on that right now.,1681.346,1.201
"April: You have nothing to announce, but",1682.547,1.702
people are concerned --,1684.249,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I understand people.,1684.916,1.368
I understand we&amp;#39;ve heard a lot of rumors about what,1686.284,1.635
may or may not.,1687.919,0.701
"When we have something to announce on that,",1688.62,2.436
we will do it.,1691.056,0.767
But I don&amp;#39;t think it should be any surprise,1691.823,1.668
"that the President, when it comes to rooting out",1693.491,1.702
"radical Islamic terrorism, which is what that",1695.193,2.469
"initially was supposed to be focused on, he is going",1697.662,2.102
to make sure that that is a major focus of his,1699.764,2.803
keeping this country safe.,1702.567,1.668
And so I don&amp;#39;t have anything further for,1704.235,1.802
you on that.,1706.037,0.667
I&amp;#39;m just --,1706.704,0.668
April: What about excluding people -- there,1707.372,1.601
are reports about excluding white,1708.973,1.335
supremacists from --,1710.308,0.834
"Mr. Spicer: Okay, April.",1711.142,1.068
There are reports.,1712.21,0.901
I don&amp;#39;t have anything for you.,1713.111,0.934
"I just said I don&amp;#39;t have anything for you, but I",1714.045,1.335
will be very clear that this President&amp;#39;s,1715.38,1.334
commitment to rooting out radical Islamic terrorism,1716.714,1.869
is something that is at the forefront,1718.583,1.368
of his agenda.,1719.951,0.667
And I know that there&amp;#39;s been a lot of reports,1720.618,1.602
about where that program or that effort,1722.22,2.369
is going to lie.,1724.589,0.667
April: Is there going to be any kind of target on,1725.256,3.07
the issues of white supremacy?,1728.326,0.834
Mr. Spicer: I have nothing else.,1729.16,1.368
"Thank you, April. Cecilia.",1730.528,0.668
"Cecilia: Sean, thank you.",1731.196,0.667
"The President has been using some tough talk,",1731.863,1.335
tough language on Iran -- &amp;quot;playing with fire.&amp;quot;,1733.198,1.334
Should Americans be ready for the possibility of,1734.532,2.303
military action with Iran?,1736.835,2.068
Is that on the table?,1738.903,1.168
"Mr. Spicer: Look, I&amp;#39;ve said this before, the",1740.071,1.602
President has been very clear: He doesn&amp;#39;t take,1741.673,1.902
"options off the table, but he understands the impact",1743.575,2.369
of something like that.,1745.944,1.301
The sanctions today I think are going to be,1747.245,1.501
"very, very strong and impactful.",1748.746,3.637
And I hope that Iran realizes that after the,1752.383,2.47
"provocative measures that they&amp;#39;ve taken, that they",1754.853,2.335
understand that this President and this,1757.188,1.969
administration is not going to sit back and,1759.157,1.401
take it lightly.,1760.558,0.668
John Gizzi.,1761.226,0.667
"John Gizzi: Thank you, Sean.",1761.893,1.101
"On Monday, several published reports say that",1762.994,4.271
it will be a tie in the Senate on the confirmation,1767.265,3.237
"of Betsy DeVos for the Secretary of Education,",1770.502,2.769
and Mike Pence will have to cast a historic,1773.271,4.371
tie-breaking vote as Vice President.,1777.642,2.536
Should we be watching for any surprises?,1780.178,2.97
Has the Congressional Affairs Office perhaps,1783.148,2.168
gotten one more vote from,1785.316,2.069
the &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; camp into the &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;?,1787.385,1.468
Or do you expect the Vice President to be on,1788.853,2.303
hand to confirm her?,1791.156,0.9
"Mr. Spicer: Look, I would say this, Betsy DeVos, as",1792.056,2.536
"I mentioned before, is an unbelievable champion of",1794.592,3.003
"education -- for children, for teachers, for parents.",1797.595,3.37
"I hope that that vote gets 60, 70 votes.",1800.965,4.438
"She is an unbelievable, remarkable woman who has",1805.403,2.536
fought very hard to improve our nation&amp;#39;s,1807.939,2.936
education system and to make sure that schools are,1810.875,2.269
serving children.,1813.144,1.535
And I think that we are going to make sure we do,1814.679,1.468
"everything we can, and we feel 100 percent confident",1816.147,2.603
that she will be confirmed Monday night and be the,1818.75,1.568
next Secretary of Education.,1820.318,1.134
"Thank you, guys.",1821.452,1.035
Have a great weekend.,1822.487,0.734
The President is about to sign executive orders.,1823.221,2.235
I hope you all have a great weekend.,1825.456,1.335
"To those of you who can&amp;#39;t travel down to Florida,",1826.791,1.902
we&amp;#39;ll be gaggling on the plane on Monday.,1828.693,5.005
Thank you.,1836.968,2.069
Have a great weekend.,1839.037,4.104
