Mr. Spicer: Good afternoon.,1.301,3.336
Just before I came up I wanted to let you know,4.637,3.304
that we&amp;#39;re monitoring the severe weather that&amp;#39;s,7.941,1.735
going through Louisiana at this time.,9.676,1.968
The President&amp;#39;s aware of the situation and is going,11.644,1.969
to be reaching out to local and state officials,13.613,1.869
throughout the day.,15.482,1.701
"Also, yesterday evening the President concurred",17.183,2.436
with the FEMA administrator&amp;#39;s,19.619,1.101
recommendation to approve Governor Bryant&amp;#39;s request,20.72,2.97
to add public assistant to the previously issued,23.69,3.236
major disaster declaration in Mississippi.,26.926,2.47
"Per the governor&amp;#39;s request, public assistance",29.396,2.702
"will be added for three counties: Forrest,",32.098,2.136
"Lamar, and Perry.",34.234,1.668
"Yesterday, the President had an amazing day at",35.902,2.536
MacDill Air Force Base where he met with leaders,38.438,2.536
of both Special Operations Command and Central,40.974,3.37
"Command, and then had lunch with enlisted",44.344,2.135
service members thanking them for their service and,46.479,2.536
hearing the ideas that were on their mind.,49.015,2.302
The President announced his intent to make,51.317,2.303
historic financial investment in the armed,53.62,2.469
"forces of the United States, showing the entire",56.089,2.402
world that America has the back of all those who,58.491,2.069
stand in defense of freedom.,60.56,2.402
"As he has said many times before, the armed forces",62.962,2.336
are at the very center of our fight against radical,65.298,2.436
"Islamic terrorism, and we must protect those",67.734,2.402
who protect us.,70.136,1.235
The President kicked off today with a listening,71.371,1.802
session of county sheriffs from around the country.,73.173,2.435
The President welcomed leaders from the National,75.608,1.635
Sheriff&amp;#39;s Association to the White House and,77.243,2.136
pledged to work closely with all members of law,79.379,2.102
enforcement to keep the American people safe.,81.481,3.103
He assured the sheriffs that the Trump,84.584,1.468
administration will make every effort to stop drugs,86.052,3.203
"and crime from flowing into the country, put an",89.255,2.703
"end to the opioid epidemic, secure the",91.958,2.503
"borders, keep terrorists out, and strengthen the",94.461,3.903
"bonds between state, local, and federal law",98.364,1.902
enforcement agencies.,100.266,1.502
The sheriffs thanked the President for what they,101.768,1.702
described as his &amp;quot;unprecedented level of,103.47,2.535
support for law enforcement&amp;quot; and offered,106.005,2.069
their full backing of his border security and,108.074,2.336
immigration policies.,110.41,1.701
They expressed how encouraged they&amp;#39;ve been by,112.111,2.069
the pro-law enforcement atmosphere that has swept,114.18,5.105
the country in the wake of the President&amp;#39;s victory.,119.285,2.303
They also presented a letter on behalf of the,121.588,2.102
National Sheriff&amp;#39;s Association thanking the,123.69,2.235
President for his &amp;quot;recent show of support for law,125.925,2.336
"enforcement, specifically on immigration and border",128.261,2.636
security issues&amp;quot; and commending the President&amp;#39;s,130.897,2.836
two executive orders for taking &amp;quot;significant steps,133.733,2.97
to enhancing public safety.&amp;quot; The group engaged,136.703,3.069
in a wide-ranging discussion about the,139.772,2.002
"issues facing law enforcement, which the",141.774,2.136
sheriffs said was an opportunity they hadn&amp;#39;t,143.91,1.535
been given under the previous administration.,145.445,3.036
The sheriffs closed the meeting by thanking the,148.481,1.668
"President for defending the rule of law, and the",150.149,2.103
President took them in the oval office to honor them,152.252,2.168
and show his appreciation for their outstanding work,154.42,2.47
they do to keep our communities safe.,156.89,2.235
A list of the attendees is available for those,159.125,1.802
who are interested.,160.927,1.568
"After that meeting, the President held another",162.495,1.502
listening session on how to best fix the VA.,163.997,2.235
It&amp;#39;s a top priority for the President and this,166.232,2.503
administration to ensure that veterans get the care,168.735,2.169
"they need, when and where they need it.",170.904,2.402
"Tragically, many of our veterans are being failed",173.306,2.035
by a system that does not work.,175.341,2.069
This administration will reform and modernize the,177.41,2.402
"VA under the leadership of Dr. Shulkin, creating a",179.812,3.504
culture of accountability that puts our veterans first.,183.316,3.37
The President welcomed the group to the Roosevelt,186.686,1.768
room and expressed his intention to take whatever,188.454,2.069
steps are necessary to improve healthcare access,190.523,3.237
and quality for our heroic veterans.,193.76,2.836
"Ms. Tiffany Smiley, the wife of a veteran who was",196.596,3.103
"blinded by an IED, detailed her family&amp;#39;s",199.699,2.936
difficulty and experience with the VA&amp;#39;s healthcare,202.635,2.202
system and offered suggestions to how it,204.837,2.069
could be improved.,206.906,1.235
"The President, VA secretary-designate",208.141,2.035
"Dr. Shulkin, and a group of healthcare expert and",210.176,2.136
"veterans advocates, including Ike and Laura",212.312,2.636
"Perlmutter, engaged in a wide-ranging discussion on",214.948,3.336
reforming the VA so that the needs of,218.284,1.702
veterans come first.,219.986,2.202
The experts discussed private-sector solutions,222.188,2.336
and innovations that could be used to improve the VA.,224.524,3.203
The President praised the secretary designate for,227.727,2.236
his commitment to veterans and thanked the group,229.963,2.035
for their willingness to serve and do what was best,231.998,2.035
for our veterans.,234.033,1.268
The plan to meet on a regular basis to discuss,235.301,2.002
their collective efforts to improve the VA and its,237.303,2.269
healthcare system.,239.572,1.435
"Also this afternoon, the Vice President had a big",241.007,2.002
"day on Capitol Hill where he cast the historic,",243.009,2.569
deciding vote for Secretary of,245.578,1.502
Education Betsy DeVos.,247.08,3.136
The President believes strongly that our nation&amp;#39;s,250.216,1.702
"success depends on education of our students,",251.918,2.636
and Betsy DeVos has devoted her nearly three,254.554,2.169
decades of her time and talent to promoting,256.723,2.602
educational opportunity.,259.325,1.702
"As secretary, she will ensure that every student",261.027,2.169
"has access to a good school, whether it&amp;#39;s",263.196,2.035
"public, private, parochial, charter,",265.231,2.302
or any other kind.,267.533,1.402
The fact that we had to get to the point where the,268.935,1.535
Vice President had to be pulled in to overcome the,270.47,2.636
Democrats historic and partisan logjam with the,273.106,3.136
President&amp;#39;s qualified nominee is another glaring,276.242,3.203
reminder of the unprecedented obstruction,279.445,3.204
that Senate Democrats,282.649,1.034
have engaged in throughout this process.,283.683,2.536
The American people sent a strong message when they,286.219,2.035
elected President Trump in November.,288.254,1.568
They&amp;#39;re fed up with business as,289.822,1.468
usual in Washington.,291.29,1.736
Democrats in the Senate should expect that voters,293.026,2.235
will remember how they stood in the way of the,295.261,1.969
President in acting an agenda that put,297.23,1.968
him into office.,299.198,1.368
Last week I noted the President had a fair,300.566,1.635
amount of cabinet-level appointees awaiting a full,302.201,2.47
vote by the Senate.,304.671,1.434
We&amp;#39;re looking forward to seeing more of the,306.105,1.335
President&amp;#39;s pick to lead agencies and departments,307.44,2.569
"confirmed in the upcoming week, despite these",310.009,2.269
childish tactics of the Democrats in the Senate,312.278,1.969
who would rather keep the failed status quo than,314.247,2.269
allowing to put the President&amp;#39;s people in place.,316.516,3.036
"Also on the hill today, Judge Gorsuch continues a",319.552,2.136
full week of meetings with Republican,321.688,1.568
and Democratic senators.,323.256,1.468
Yesterday he met with Senators Tester and Feinstein.,324.724,2.636
"Today he will meet with Senators Sasse, Schumer,",327.36,2.703
"Crapo, and Thune.",330.063,0.667
The President is looking forward to a full hearing,330.73,3.403
for the judge followed by an up or down vote on,334.133,2.303
this incredibly qualified nominee.,336.436,2.535
"At this moment, the President is meeting with",338.971,1.469
Congressman Jason Chaffetz to discuss how to work,340.44,2.402
together to enact his reform agenda.,342.842,2.803
"Later this afternoon, the President will meet with",345.645,1.535
Secretary of State Tillerson.,347.18,1.401
The President was obviously pleased to,348.581,1.835
"welcome and confirm, swear in Secretary Tillerson in",350.416,3.27
"the oval office last week, and he&amp;#39;s pleased the",353.686,1.902
secretary is now able to bring his unique skill set,355.588,3.103
and deep insights to the important work of the,358.691,2.002
State Department.,360.693,1.168
"Following his discussion with Secretary Tillerson,",361.861,2.436
the President will have calls with Prime Minister,364.297,2.335
Rajoy of Spain and President Erdogan of Turkey.,366.632,3.003
"We&amp;#39;ll, of course, have readouts of both of those",369.635,1.869
calls when they&amp;#39;re completed.,371.504,1.602
This evening the President will host young officers,373.106,1.968
from the United States Army Special Forces,375.074,2.302
Qualification Course in the oval office.,377.376,2.236
"As the President said yesterday, members of our",379.612,1.635
military and their families are,381.247,1.301
our nation&amp;#39;s heroes.,382.548,1.502
It is one of his top priorities to ensure that,384.05,1.768
the men and women of our armed forces have the,385.818,2.102
"tools, equipment, and resources they need to",387.92,2.102
execute their mission successfully.,390.022,2.236
The President&amp;#39;s looking forward to conveying his,392.258,1.468
"gratitude and support to these young,",393.726,1.902
brave captains.,395.628,1.468
"Later this evening around 6:00, the 9th Circuit",397.096,3.303
Court will hold oral arguments per its,400.399,2.336
order from yesterday.,402.735,0.968
I want to quickly run down what we can expect,403.703,2.269
to happen tonight.,405.972,1.701
A career attorney from the Department of Justice will,407.673,2.169
present an argument in defense of the,409.842,1.802
President&amp;#39;s order.,411.644,1.301
"And to be clear, all that&amp;#39;s at issue tonight is",412.945,3.437
the hearing is an interim decision on whether the,416.382,2.169
President&amp;#39;s order is enforced or not until the,418.551,3.47
case is heard on the actual merits of the order.,422.021,3.07
It&amp;#39;s a simple status quo versus,425.091,1.868
anti-status quo decision.,426.959,1.836
This is just like the case in Boston which started as,428.795,2.702
a temporary restraining order.,431.497,1.535
"There, once we were able to explain our position,",433.032,1.935
the court lifted the order and held that the,434.967,1.468
President&amp;#39;s executive order could take effect.,436.435,2.937
"As I&amp;#39;ve stated before, 8 U.S.",439.372,2.369
Code 1182 gives the President constitutional,441.741,3.27
authority for this executive order.,445.011,1.434
"It says, &amp;quot;Whenever the President finds that the",446.445,2.536
entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into,448.981,3.938
the United States would be detrimental to the,452.919,2.469
"interests of the United States, he may by",455.388,2.135
"proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem",457.523,2.77
"necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any",460.293,3.069
class of aliens as immigrants or,463.362,1.702
"non-immigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any",465.064,3.37
restrictions which he may deem appropriate.&amp;quot; We look,468.434,3.404
forward to a final decision on the,471.838,1.401
merits of this soon.,473.239,1.835
"Looking ahead, I know a few of you have been",475.074,1.401
asking about more details on Prime Minister Abe&amp;#39;s,476.475,2.036
visit later this week.,478.511,0.934
"As previously announced, he will visit the White",479.445,2.436
House for meetings on the 10th of February.,481.881,2.569
The President has also invited him down to,484.45,1.835
"Mar-a-Lago, and the two leaders will travel there",486.285,2.67
for the weekend.,488.955,1.067
This is a testament to the importance the United,490.022,1.936
"States places on the bi-lateral relationship,",491.958,2.602
"and the strength of our alliance, and the deep",494.56,1.902
economic ties between the United States and Japan.,496.462,3.404
"Needless to say, the President&amp;#39;s looking very",499.866,1.701
much forward to welcoming the New England Patriots,501.567,3.037
to the White House to celebrate their fifth,504.604,2.402
world championship.,507.006,1.301
It was obviously a spectacular game.,508.307,2.57
"Lastly, we have our eyes on Kabul today following",510.877,3.903
the tragic suicide bombing that killed at least 19,514.78,2.57
Afghan civilians and wounded 14.,517.35,2.602
"Just this morning, General Flynn spoke with the",519.952,1.969
Afghan national security advisor to reaffirm our,521.921,2.636
continued support for Afghanistan and for our,524.557,2.502
strategic partnership.,527.059,1.569
We condemn this cowardly attack in the strongest,528.628,2.168
"possible terms, and we commend the Afghan",530.796,2.67
security forces for their rapid response.,533.466,2.702
We also reaffirm our support to the Afghan,536.168,2.236
government as they work to defend their people and,538.404,2.803
against enemies of peace.,541.207,1.902
"And with that, I&amp;#39;ll take your questions.",543.109,1.568
"The Press: Sean, the list of 78 terrorist attacks",544.677,3.804
that you released.,548.481,0.734
It looked like it had been prepared well in advance.,549.215,3.236
"I mean, but was that already on hand when",552.451,2.136
President Trump made his comments or did you,554.587,1.935
do it afterwards?,556.522,1.502
Why&amp;#39;d you release it?,558.024,0.767
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think the answer was we had been",558.791,2.236
getting questions as to what the,561.027,1.334
President&amp;#39;s remarks were.,562.361,1.135
We wanted to be very clear that there are a lot of,563.496,2.269
"examples between 2014 and 2015 that have occurred,",565.765,3.203
and many of them haven&amp;#39;t gotten the attention,568.968,1.802
that they have deserved.,570.77,0.734
It&amp;#39;s becoming too often that we&amp;#39;re seeing these,571.504,2.235
attacks not get the spectacular attention,573.739,2.97
that they deserve.,576.709,0.767
And I think it undermines the understanding of the,577.476,3.671
threat that we face around this country.,581.147,2.302
The reasons the President&amp;#39;s acting in so,583.449,2.469
many of the way that he has with executive order,585.918,1.902
"and otherwise, the discussions that he had",587.82,2.136
"down at CENTCOM and SOCOM yesterday, are because he",589.956,2.702
cares about making sure that we don&amp;#39;t have attacks,592.658,3.003
"in this country, that we&amp;#39;re protected, that",595.661,1.835
we&amp;#39;re ahead of the curve.,597.496,0.868
And I think what we need to do is remind people,598.364,2.636
that the earth is a very dangerous place these days.,601,2.336
"That ISIS is trying to do us harm, and that the",603.336,2.569
President&amp;#39;s commitment is to keep this country safe.,605.905,2.169
And I think part of this is to make sure that the,608.074,2.068
American people are reminded how prevalent,610.142,3.504
some of these attacks are and how much time and,613.646,2.969
attention they have or have not gotten.,616.615,1.936
"But, more importantly, that they understand the",618.551,2.269
unwavering commitment that the President has and the,620.82,3.403
actions that he will take to keep the country safe.,624.223,1.668
"The Press: Just to be clear, was the list",625.891,1.035
put together after his comments?,626.926,1.068
"Mr. Spicer Yes, yes.",627.994,0.467
The Press: After his comments?,628.461,0.6
Mr. Spicer Yes.,629.061,0.401
"The Press: Sean, Sean.",629.462,0.6
Mr. Spicer Trey.,630.062,0.401
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",630.463,0.4
On the call with Turkish President Erdogan later,630.863,1.034
"today, does President Trump intend to discuss",631.897,2.303
"plans for Syrian safe zones, and does the",634.2,2.135
President expect Turkey to help create those zones?,636.335,2.636
Mr. Spicer I think we&amp;#39;ll have a read out,638.971,1.502
for you on that.,640.473,0.667
I don&amp;#39;t want to get ahead of the two leader&amp;#39;s calls.,641.14,2.636
"Alexus, Real Clear Politics.",643.776,1.868
"The Press: Sean, I have two questions for you.",645.644,1.268
Mr. Spicer Yeah.,646.912,0.367
The Press: You were mentioning that voters are,647.279,1.736
going to remember how senators voted on the,649.015,1.835
President&amp;#39;s Cabinet nominees.,650.85,1.902
"Two Republicans voted against Betsy DeVos,",652.752,2.569
Senators Collins and Murkowski.,655.321,2.369
"Did the President reach out to either of them, and",657.69,2.936
will he not forget what Republicans did in,660.626,4.571
that particular nominee situation?,665.197,1.202
Mr. Spicer I think that - look - the President&amp;#39;s,666.399,2.869
been very clear.,669.268,0.667
It&amp;#39;s not Republicans that have stood in the way of,669.935,1.469
this nomination of all of these,671.404,1.968
qualified individuals.,673.372,1.001
It&amp;#39;s been Democrats that have stalled over,674.373,2.336
and over again.,676.709,1.335
Not attending hearings.,678.044,1.668
Trying to use every delay tactic possible.,679.712,2.302
"It&amp;#39;s those people that have a problem, and I",682.014,2.636
think that&amp;#39;s the message that the party has missed,684.65,3.003
"on the Democratic side, which would - and I don&amp;#39;t",687.653,3.871
think that - wouldn&amp;#39;t paint that with a broad,691.524,1.801
"brush, because I think it&amp;#39;s Senate Democrats,",693.325,1.702
"frankly, that haven&amp;#39;t gotten the message.",695.027,1.602
The Press: But has he reached out to them?,696.629,1.101
Mr. Spicer Our team has been in contact with all,697.73,1.501
- with the entire Senate team -,699.231,1.702
The Press: Okay.,700.933,1.001
Mr. Spicer - to make sure that they understand and,701.934,1.468

"But we&amp;#39;ve been in constant contact with the Senate,",705.371,2.302
"the members of the Senate, their staffs.",707.673,2.035
Our legislative team has had an extremely robust,709.708,3.137
schedule of meetings with their teams to make these,712.845,3.136
"nominees available to them, but I think the",715.981,3.037
"broader issue - again, and with all due respect - I",719.018,2.302
think it&amp;#39;s interesting that we&amp;#39;re focusing on the,721.32,2.102
votes of two Republicans.,723.422,1.235
When you look at the spectrum of antics that,724.657,2.903
have gone on in the Democrats.,727.56,1.201
"I mean, the tactics that they have done over and",728.761,2.302
"over and over again to delay, not show",731.063,2.703
up to hearings.,733.766,0.701
"You know, filibuster to the extent that they can.",734.467,2.802
Run the clock out.,737.269,1.702
"It&amp;#39;s not Republicans that have a problem here, Alexus.",738.971,2.069
It&amp;#39;s the Democrats that continue to do this.,741.04,1.868
The Press: My other question has to do with,742.908,1.335
the President&amp;#39;s remarks about the Affordable Care,744.243,1.435
Act in his interview on Sunday.,745.678,1.468
Because he indicated in his response in that,747.146,3.57
interview that he thought that the repeal in place,750.716,2.87
was going to take longer - perhaps into 2018 - can,753.586,3.436
"you clarify whether he is frustrated about this,",757.022,3.938
"what he is doing about the timing, because of course,",760.96,2.469
voters who sent him here were anticipating that,763.429,3.27
this might move faster than he was conveying in,766.699,3.003
the interview?,769.702,0.901
"Mr. Spicer Well, I think, luckily, and you saw",770.603,1.234
"Speaker Ryan&amp;#39;s comments earlier today, I think we",771.837,2.236
can have this done legislatively sooner,774.073,2.102
"rather than later, but I think the implementation",776.175,1.802
of a lot of the pieces may take a little bit longer.,777.977,2.102
"It&amp;#39;s a big, big bill that the Democrats passed.",780.079,2.135
"As you recall, they told us we could read it after",782.214,1.769
they passed it.,783.983,1.101
We&amp;#39;re now going through this to make sure that we,785.084,2.769
do this in a very responsible way to make,787.853,2.303
"sure that healthcare, which is so vital to so",790.156,2.268
"many Americans and their families, is preserved",792.424,3.637
while we put a new system in place that both lowers,796.061,2.136
cost and increases accessibility.,798.197,1.969
"But the President, I think, is very encouraged",800.166,2.402
by the commitment and work that&amp;#39;s going on the Hill,802.568,2.069
to make sure that we get this thing replaced as,804.637,2.602

One thing to ask.,813.112,0.7
Actually a follow up to that.,813.812,2.136
"Speaker Ryan has actually said, and I&amp;#39;m quoting,",815.948,2.936
"&amp;quot;With Obamacare, you can&amp;#39;t tinker at the margins and",818.884,4.672
repair it; you can&amp;#39;t; it&amp;#39;s a collapsing law.&amp;quot;,823.556,3.837
Do you agree with that in that you can&amp;#39;t build on,827.393,4.871
what&amp;#39;s already there.,832.264,1.001
We have to get rid of the entire law?,833.265,0.901
Mr. Spicer: I think what we&amp;#39;re focused on,834.166,2.436
is the end solution.,836.602,1.068
And I think we&amp;#39;ve been very clear over and over,837.67,1.735
"again, the President is going to repeal and",839.405,1.768
"replace it, and that what Americans will get at the",841.173,3.537
"end of this is a healthcare solution that,",844.71,3.403
"as I&amp;#39;ve said before over and over again, is going",848.113,1.969
to give them a lower cost health solution,850.082,2.536
with more options.,852.618,0.734
That&amp;#39;s what they were promised in,853.352,1.001
the first place.,854.353,1.001
"That&amp;#39;s what we can give, and I think the President",855.354,1.702
being able to approach this in the business-like,857.056,2.569
manner that he&amp;#39;s done so successfully in the past,859.625,2.603
"is going to ensure that he negotiates prices, that we",862.228,2.235
"look at those business-like practice,",864.463,2.136
force competition amongst states and other things,866.599,2.869
that will help lower cost once and for all and,869.468,1.735
provide that competition.,871.203,0.968

that Adam Szubin is the acting Secretary in,878.21,2.87
terms of implementing those sanctions?,881.08,2.068

on Twitter and criticized the federal judge,890.823,3.603
appointed by George W.,894.426,1.101
Bush who imposed that nationwide restraining order.,895.527,4.939
He called him a &amp;quot;so-called judge&amp;quot;.,900.466,2.035
"Is the President, as it relates to the arguments -",902.501,3.103
I know that you&amp;#39;re confident that the,905.604,1.835
arguments that will be presented this evening -,907.439,2.136
is he prepared to accept an adverse ruling by the,909.575,3.937
9th Circuit Court of Appeals?,913.512,1.068
Mr. Spicer There&amp;#39;s no question that the,914.58,2.002
President respects the judicial branch in its,916.582,2.235
"ruling, but I think there&amp;#39;s no way - I just",918.817,1.535
read off the US code on that - I don&amp;#39;t think,920.352,1.969
"there&amp;#39;s any other way that you can interpret that,",922.321,2.936
that the President has the discretion to do what&amp;#39;s,925.257,1.969
necessary to keep this country safe.,927.226,1.468
"And I think that&amp;#39;s-that&amp;#39;s his concern, frankly,",928.694,2.636
right now that when the law is such as it is that,931.33,4.237
anyone could interpret that any other way.,935.567,1.635
I think he feels confident just like in the ruling in,937.202,2.336
Boston that we&amp;#39;re going to prevail on this on the,939.538,3.27
merits of the case because it is done so in a,942.808,2.769

is the President is doing everything he can to move,985.984,3.17
"this country forward, and I think whether it&amp;#39;s the",989.154,1.869
Democrats and the Senate who are trying to stall,991.023,2.302
these nominees or these political stunts on the,993.325,2.503
"House side, the bottom line is that, by and",995.828,2.235
"large, you see the support that the President is",998.063,2.169
"receiving for his policies throughout the country,",1000.232,2.202
and it&amp;#39;s because I think people recognize a) the,1002.434,2.803

"commitment to both keeping this country safe, growing",1008.04,2.669
"the economy, and creating jobs is something that is",1010.709,1.702
welcome by all Americans regardless of party.,1012.411,2.336
I think when you see stuff like that it really just,1014.747,2.469
shows that they missed the message that voters sent,1017.216,4.471
this past November.,1021.687,2.102

on Sunday because of the - because of questions about,1028.827,2.903
her credibility.,1031.73,0.601
Is the White House willing to offer alternative,1032.331,2.135
representatives for the networks that refuse to,1034.466,2.269
work with specific spokespeople?,1036.735,1.902

"However you want to put it, I don&amp;#39;t care.",1044.777,1.334
But I think Kellyanne is a very trusted aid,1046.111,3.037
of the President.,1049.148,0.8
I think to - for any characterization,1049.948,1.936
otherwise is insulting.,1051.884,1.401
I don&amp;#39;t think if they choose to not work with,1053.285,2.202
"someone, that&amp;#39;s up to them, but I think we&amp;#39;re",1055.487,1.335
going to continue to put out key leaders to this,1056.822,2.102

articulate the President&amp;#39;s policies and agenda.,1060.859,2.469
Katie Pavlich.,1063.328,2.169
The Press: [inaudible] for this question.,1065.497,2.069
Is President Trump planning to ask the Senate,1067.566,1.869
to expedite legislation for the split firing of,1069.435,3.003
bad VA employees?,1072.438,1.668
"Mr. Spicer: I think the President&amp;#39;s commitment, as",1074.106,2.002
"you heard both during the campaign, and as he&amp;#39;s",1076.108,3.003
"talked to Dr. Shulkin, is to make sure that we&amp;#39;re",1079.111,2.536
"providing the best care, and if there&amp;#39;s things that",1081.647,2.102
are an impediment to that care being offered up or,1083.749,4.037
"reformed, then he is going to make sure that we enact",1087.786,2.703
policies internally that make sure that people who,1090.489,2.803
"are not doing their job not servicing veterans, we",1093.292,4.07
can figure out how to expedite that process.,1097.362,2.803
But the idea that we&amp;#39;re sitting around having a,1100.165,2.169
discussion about personnel inhibiting the care that,1102.334,3.437
veterans deserve really does not bode well for the,1105.771,2.869
reflection that we want on this country.,1108.64,1.535
"I mean, the people who have served this nation -",1110.175,2.67
we should be bending over backward to make sure that,1112.845,1.768
the benefits and the care and the services that,1114.613,2.502
"they, frankly, earned is something that is given",1117.115,2.269

going to talk about a shared commitment to,1149.915,2.169
"defeating ISIS, and that they&amp;#39;ll discuss our",1152.084,4.237
bilateral relationship and reaffirm our company,1156.321,1.802
to the countries.,1158.123,0.667
We will have a readout on that call with Spain as we,1158.79,3.07
will with all the countries and all,1161.86,1.702
the other leaders that we will talk to.,1163.562,1.735
And we have in the past.,1165.297,1.134
"So, I don&amp;#39;t want to get too far ahead of it, but I",1166.431,1.602
would imagine that the current relationship that,1168.033,3.003
we have with Spain and our commitment to ISIS will be,1171.036,2.135
at the forefront of that.,1173.171,1.235
Maria Penna.,1174.406,1.335
Maria.,1175.741,0.767
The Press: Yeah.,1176.508,0.234
Here.,1176.742,0.367
Saying here.,1177.109,1.067
It&amp;#39;s kind of loud in here.,1178.176,1.969
"So it&amp;#39;s a two-part question: one, can you",1180.145,1.702
confirm whether or not the White House has accepted,1181.847,3.136
"the credentials of the new Mexican ambassador,",1184.983,1.936
Geronimo Gutierrez?,1186.919,1.735
"And, also, Representative Mike Rogers, I believe,",1188.654,4.17
this morning said that he plans to introduce a bill,1192.824,2.002
to impose a two percent tax on all remittances,1194.826,3.637
that Mexicans send to their country to,1198.463,2.67
pay for the wall.,1201.133,0.801
Would the President rally behind that bill?,1201.934,2.969
"Mr. Spicer So, first, I have to get back to you",1204.903,3.037
on the ambassador&amp;#39;s credentials.,1207.94,1.334
We can check with the Department of State and,1209.274,2.936
figure that out.,1212.21,0.901
"I don&amp;#39;t know that right off the top of my head,",1213.111,1.469
and I&amp;#39;m not going to comment - we don&amp;#39;t put out,1214.58,1.968
statements of administration policy,1216.548,1.502
until the bill has gone through the process.,1218.05,2.102
Haley.,1220.152,0.7
The Press: Two questions for you.,1220.852,1.335
"One, following up on healthcare, the President,",1222.187,1.835
"as you know, campaigned for 18 months on replacing",1224.022,2.703
the Affordable Care Act.,1226.725,1.068
Where is his plan?,1227.793,1.468
"Mr. Spicer Well, he&amp;#39;s working with Congress.",1229.261,2.069
"I just asked for that - answered that question,",1231.33,1.601

"mean, you&amp;#39;re acting like -",1234.933,1.068
The Press: But the specifics of it though?,1236.001,0.767
Does he owe the American people something now?,1236.768,1.902
Mr. Spicer And I think that&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s been very,1238.67,1.502
clear that he owes the American people a result,1240.172,4.07
that&amp;#39;s going to lower cost and provide more access.,1244.242,2.303
That&amp;#39;s what he continues to work with Speaker Ryan on.,1246.545,2.702
I think the Speaker was very clear on it.,1249.247,1.736
"That they&amp;#39;re having meetings, both",1250.983,1.568
legislatively and at the principle level to make,1252.551,2.202
"sure that this gets done, and I think that, as you",1254.753,1.835
"heard Speaker Ryan, we continue to be optimistic",1256.588,2.002
about getting this thing completed by this year.,1258.59,1.969
"It&amp;#39;s a mammoth bill what they passed and did it,",1260.559,3.17
and I think we&amp;#39;ve got to make sure that,1263.729,1.334
we do this right.,1265.063,0.901
We don&amp;#39;t want to end up with the same result that,1265.964,1.568
the Democrats did.,1267.532,0.701
They rushed it through; no one was able to read the,1268.233,2.436
"bill, and premiums have skyrocketed; access and",1270.669,3.003
options have gone down.,1273.672,1.301
We need to make sure that we don&amp;#39;t do this in a way,1274.973,1.869

Mr. Spicer Right.,1288.22,0.667
"The Press: Any response from the White House, and",1288.887,1.401
do you still stand by your characterization -,1290.288,1.268
"Mr. Spicer Well, I-I -",1291.556,0.668
The Press: - characterization that it,1292.224,0.6
was a successful raid?,1292.824,0.501
Mr. Spicer Absolutely.,1293.325,0.6
That-that - he was not - that-that-the raid that,1293.925,1.335
was conducted in Yemen,1295.26,0.701
was an intelligence-gathering raid.,1295.961,1.568
That&amp;#39;s what it was.,1297.529,1.235
It was highly successful.,1298.764,1.701
"It achieved the purpose it was going to get, saved",1300.465,2.169
the loss of life that we suffered and the,1302.634,1.735
injuries that occurred -,1304.369,1.568
The Press: So you&amp;#39;re going back on reporting,1305.937,1.335
that he was a target?,1307.272,1.001
Mr. Spicer Absolutely.,1308.273,0.601
He was not - the goal of the raid was,1308.874,2.269
"intelligence-gathering, and that&amp;#39;s what we",1311.143,2.102
"received, and that&amp;#39;s what we got.",1313.245,1.401
That&amp;#39;s why we can deem it a success.,1314.646,1.335
John Roberts.,1315.981,0.667
"The Press: If-if - and another, I know that you",1316.648,1.435

"Supreme Court, and -",1326.224,0.801
"Mr. Spicer Well, let&amp;#39;s see what we got.",1327.025,0.534
I mean -,1327.559,0.601
The Press: - is he -,1328.16,0.4
Mr. Spicer He&amp;#39;s made it clear that he -,1328.56,0.834
"The Press: - can I, can I just finish?",1329.394,0.634
"Mr. Spicer Yeah, you can.",1330.028,1.135
The Press: Thank you.,1331.163,0.6
Mr. Spicer I&amp;#39;m sorry.,1331.763,0.634
The Press: And is he concerned that if this,1332.397,1.335
does go to the Supreme Court with his current 4-4,1333.732,1.868
make-up that this temporary restraining,1335.6,2.169
order may become a little more permanent?,1337.769,3.537
"Mr. Spicer Well, remember that tonight is about just",1341.306,1.568
a restraining order.,1342.874,1.001
"We&amp;#39;re not - right - I understand, but I think",1343.875,1.802
"that it&amp;#39;s important to explain this to everyone,",1345.677,1.969
"John, because I know you get it and so many other -",1347.646,2.436
but I-I just want to make sure that we&amp;#39;re - tonight,1350.082,1.301
is about the restraining order.,1351.383,1.635
It has nothing to do with the merits of the case.,1353.018,2.836
And that&amp;#39;s why I think we feel confident.,1355.854,1.468
The question is does the restraining order,1357.322,2.002
get lifted or not?,1359.324,1.668
"But, regardless of what happens tonight, the",1360.992,2.703
"merits of the case still need to be to discuss, and",1363.695,3.237
"I think the merits of the case, as they were in",1366.932,1.902
"Boston, were ones that we feel very confident on,",1368.834,2.402
because the law is crystal clear on this.,1371.236,2.002
The President has the authority to do this.,1373.238,2.002
It was done so in an interagency process that,1375.24,2.603
ensured that all the appropriate,1377.843,1.801
people were consulted.,1379.644,1.735
We went through that with flying colors.,1381.379,2.002
"I have zero concern that, at the end of the day,",1383.381,2.803
we will be fine.,1386.184,0.935
It&amp;#39;s just a question of going through the process.,1387.119,1.635
The Press; And I get all that -,1388.754,0.367
Mr. Spicer Okay.,1389.121,0.4
As you pointed out,1389.521,2.135
The Press: - but if he does not prevail at the,1391.656,2.269
"9th Circuit, will he take this to the Supreme Court?",1393.925,2.236
Mr. Spicer I&amp;#39;m not going to get - let&amp;#39;s see,1396.161,0.901
where it goes first.,1397.062,0.767
I think our goal right now is to get to a point,1397.829,3.07
where we can argue it on the merits.,1400.899,1.335
We feel confident based on how the court has reacted,1402.234,1.668
in Massachusetts that we&amp;#39;re going to be,1403.902,3.971
good on the merits.,1407.873,0.667
Jonathan Swan.,1408.54,1.034
"The Press: Sean, thanks for the question.",1409.574,1.602
Mr. Spicer Yeah.,1411.176,0.334
The Press: Does President Trump still plan to,1411.51,1.468
immediately terminate President Obama&amp;#39;s,1412.978,1.868
executive [inaudible]?,1414.846,1.302
Mr. Spicer With respect to what?,1416.148,1.701
Dock and doppa?,1417.849,0.701
The Press: Dock and Doppa.,1418.55,0.901
Mr. Spicer I&amp;#39;ve said this before.,1419.451,0.767
We&amp;#39;ll have further updates on that - I-I understand.,1420.218,3.17
Go ahead.,1423.388,0.634
The Press: Yeah.,1424.022,0.467
It&amp;#39;s just - in the thing it said,1424.489,1.969
&amp;quot;immediately terminate&amp;quot; -,1426.458,0.667
"Mr. Spicer I understand that, and I&amp;#39;ve said",1427.125,1.468
"before, the President will have further updates on",1428.593,2.303
both dock and doppa very shortly.,1430.896,2.402
We&amp;#39;ve been very clear on immigration what the,1433.298,2.035
President&amp;#39;s priorities would be.,1435.333,1.702
As you heard Secretary Kelly testify in front of,1437.035,2.002
"Congress today, there&amp;#39;s going to be continued",1439.037,1.802
progress on the wall and on immigration as a whole.,1440.839,2.836
So we&amp;#39;re going to have plenty of time to address,1443.675,2.269
"this - right now, he&amp;#39;s trying to do it in a very",1445.944,1.802
systematic way in accordance to where we,1447.746,3.136
"find the biggest problems, and so he&amp;#39;s been very",1450.882,2.102
clear in the past that those who are in this,1452.984,1.836
country that pose a threat to us or with a criminal,1454.82,2.769
record are where his priorities are going to be,1457.589,1.735
first and foremost.,1459.324,0.834
And we&amp;#39;re going to move through the rest of the,1460.158,1.802
folks who are in this country illegally.,1461.96,1.468
Sarah.,1463.428,0.501
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",1463.929,1.134
Back to the Iran.,1465.063,0.801
The Ayatollah Khomeini said today that Trump has,1465.864,2.903
&amp;quot;helped Iran reveal the true face of America.&amp;quot;,1468.767,3.503
"He said, &amp;quot;Iran doesn&amp;#39;t fear Trump,&amp;quot; and he",1472.27,2.036
encouraged &amp;quot;Iranians to march in the street,1474.306,2.102
against America later this week.&amp;quot;,1476.408,1.668
Does the President have a response to those very,1478.076,2.87
"aggressive comments, and does he plan to take",1480.946,1.768
additional action against Iran if its,1482.714,2.069
leaders continue to escalate tensions?,1484.783,1.735
Mr. Spicer I think the President or the Ayatollah,1486.518,2.769
is going to realize that there is a new,1489.287,1.235
President in office.,1490.522,1.435
This President is not going to sit by and let,1491.957,2.569
Iran flout its violations or its apparent violations,1494.526,4.738
to the joint agreement.,1499.264,0.934
But he will continue to take action as he sees fit.,1500.198,3.704
"The President&amp;#39;s also made clear, time and time",1503.902,1.768
"again, that he&amp;#39;s not going to project what those",1505.67,2.002
"actions will be, and he will not take anything off",1507.672,2.169
"the table, but I think Iran is kidding itself if",1509.841,2.336
they don&amp;#39;t realize that there is a new,1512.177,1.368
President in town.,1513.545,0.667
John Gizzi.,1514.212,0.668
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",1514.88,0.834
"On Thursday, weather permitting, the President",1515.714,2.736
is going to meet with airline executives from,1518.45,3.036
throughout the country.,1521.486,1.101
Two complaints from airline executives as well,1522.587,2.97
"as the pilots association have been, one, that",1525.557,3.203
Norwegian Airlines got a special advantage of,1528.76,4.238
foreign carrier permit from the Obama,1532.998,2.135
"administration, and, also, that the airlines of the",1535.133,3.804
"Emeritus, the Arab Emeritus, are state",1538.937,3.67
"subsidized, and both cases are violations of the Blue",1542.607,3.904
Skies Act between the US and the EU.,1546.511,2.536
"Is this something he&amp;#39;s going to address, and is",1549.047,3.67
he considering upending President Obama&amp;#39;s,1552.717,2.836
foreign carrier permit?,1555.553,2.536
"Mr. Spicer Well, again, that will be something",1558.089,2.636
that-that-that will be decided when they meet,1560.725,2.369
what they&amp;#39;ll talk about.,1563.094,0.701
"Obviously, the President is going to want to talk",1563.795,1.702
about economic growth and job creation and how he&amp;#39;s,1565.497,2.636
enacting orders to make sure the country is safe.,1568.133,2.202
"On the case of Norwegian, my understanding - If I&amp;#39;m",1570.335,2.836
correct - that there&amp;#39;s a deal in which they&amp;#39;re,1573.171,1.668
having 50 percent of the crews and the pilots,1574.839,2.937
are American-based.,1577.776,0.834
They&amp;#39;re flying Boeing planes.,1578.61,1.234
"There is a, you know, a huge economic interest",1579.844,4.071
that America has in that-that deal right now.,1583.915,3.003
"I don&amp;#39;t want to get ahead of the President on that,",1586.918,2.736
"but just to be clear, you&amp;#39;re talking about US",1589.654,2.202
"jobs both in terms of the people who are, you know,",1591.856,3.671
serving those planes and the person whose,1595.527,2.169
building those planes.,1597.696,0.667
That&amp;#39;s a very big difference.,1598.363,0.867
Zeek.,1599.23,0.367
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1599.597,0.534
A few minutes ago you said that the President wanted,1600.131,2.67
to remind the American people of how prevalent,1602.801,2.369
terrorist attacks are and that the Earth is a,1605.17,1.568
dangerous place.,1606.738,0.901
That kind of breaks the rhetoric we&amp;#39;ve seen in,1607.639,2.336
bipartisan administration used when it comes,1609.975,2.168
to terrorist attacks encouraging the American,1612.143,2.002
people to go about their daily lives.,1614.145,1.569
Does this President have -,1615.714,1.635
Mr. Spicer Let&amp;#39;s not get the point that -,1617.349,0.567
The Press: - a message to the American people?,1617.916,0.834
"Mr. Spicer No, no, no.",1618.75,0.5
"I think, yeah, his message to the American people is",1619.25,2.036
that he&amp;#39;s fully committed to doing everything that,1621.286,2.703
"he can to keep the country safe, and I think that",1623.989,2.869
there&amp;#39;s a big difference between what you&amp;#39;re saying,1626.858,2.769
and what the point that he was making yesterday.,1629.627,1.235
And I think that what he&amp;#39;s getting at is making - he,1630.862,2.102
was making a point as to the exposure that attacks,1632.964,14.148
"get, and I think that&amp;#39;s what he was getting at is",1647.112,1.334
"that we see these things, and then becoming",1648.446,1.335
too prevalent.,1649.781,0.667
And that&amp;#39;s why I think he wants to become ever,1650.448,1.335
"vigilant to make sure that we don&amp;#39;t ever get lax,",1651.783,1.335
that we need to be reminded that places and,1653.118,1.334
groups like ISIS continue to seek to do us harm and,1654.452,1.368
that it&amp;#39;s his job as Commander in Chief to do,1655.82,1.335
everything he can to get ahead of the curve and,1657.155,1.835
keep this country safe.,1658.99,1.335
I think when you look at the poll that came out,1660.325,1.668
"last week, and I think it was 67 percent of the",1661.993,2.102
"American people, agreed with his proposition to",1664.095,3.804
"put further restrictions on people, to make sure",1667.899,2.569
that we have countries who are sending people to the,1670.468,2.536
American - to our country - that they are coming,1673.004,2.202
"here for peaceful purposes, and that if we",1675.206,2.136
can&amp;#39;t guarantee those countries have the proper,1677.342,2.002
vetting and systems in place when they&amp;#39;re out,1679.344,2.502
"bounded to the United States, then we need to do",1681.846,1.835
"what we can, and he will do what he has to as",1683.681,3.27
President to make sure that this country is safe.,1686.951,3.003
"And that - I, so I think there&amp;#39;s a - the point that",1689.954,2.603
he was making was not to put fear into anybody but,1692.557,3.57
"to, rather, reassure them that, as President of the",1696.127,3.07
"United States, he is taking every single step",1699.197,3.103
"to do what he has to to get ahead of the threats,",1702.3,2.069
to get ahead of the concerns so we&amp;#39;re not,1704.369,3.837
looking in the rearview mirror thinking what,1708.206,1.568
"should we have done, what could we have done - that",1709.774,2.036
we&amp;#39;re preventing lives whether it&amp;#39;s the raid in,1711.81,2.168
Yemen or the law that he&amp;#39;s enacting - that he&amp;#39;s going,1713.978,2.236
to do what he can to make sure that this homeland,1716.214,2.236
and our people are protected and safe.,1718.45,2.636
Mara.,1721.086,0.667
The Press: Thank you.,1721.753,0.434
I just have two questions.,1722.187,1.067
"One of them [inaudible], and one of them healthcare.",1723.254,1.902
"When the President tweeted, &amp;quot;If something",1725.156,2.069
"happens, blame the judge and the court system,&amp;quot; did",1727.225,2.736
he mean if a terrorist attack is committed by,1729.961,3.203
"somebody from these seven countries, or any",1733.164,1.602
terrorist attack should be blamed on the,1734.766,1.768
judge and the courts?,1736.534,0.134
"Mr. Spicer Well, I-I think that the point that he -",1736.668,2.102
"the Tweet is pretty clear, but I think that his point",1738.77,2.969
is-is that kind of dovetails what I was just,1741.739,2.036
"saying to Zeke: he&amp;#39;s doing everything he can, and he",1743.775,2.836
walks in to office.,1746.611,1.235
There&amp;#39;s seven countries that the Obama,1747.846,1.968
administration has already identified as not having,1749.814,2.936
the proper systems in place to guarantee our,1752.75,2.603
"safety, and I think his immediate is to do what he",1755.353,3.704
has to do to make sure that we&amp;#39;re not looking,1759.057,2.135
"back and saying, &amp;quot;You know what we should have done?",1761.192,2.436
We should have made sure that we had stricter,1763.628,1.468
vetting in place for those seven countries.&amp;quot;,1765.096,1.835
So he took immediate and decisive action to make,1766.931,3.137
sure that this country and our people were protected.,1770.068,2.135
That&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s talking about is making sure that,1772.203,1.702
we don&amp;#39;t have a regret.,1773.905,1.201
"That a month from now, two months from now, or a year",1775.106,2.403
"from now, we had done something to protect",1777.509,2.202
"people, and so he acted as quick and as decisively as",1779.711,3.003
possible to make sure that we put the systems in,1782.714,2.636
"place to protect our people, and I don&amp;#39;t think",1785.35,2.169
there&amp;#39;s any other way to read that.,1787.519,1.368
Yeah?,1788.887,0.533
Lynn?,1789.42,0.568
The Press: That question on healthcare - can I just,1789.988,1.168
get my second question?,1791.156,0.834
"Mr. Spicer Yes, of course.",1791.99,0.534
"The Press: You just said he&amp;#39;ll negotiate prices,",1792.524,1.601
and that&amp;#39;s something he -,1794.125,1.201
"Mr. Spicer No, no, I - yeah -",1795.326,1.302
The Press: He ran on negotiating prices for,1796.628,1.668
"Medicare drug prices, and those - I just want you to",1798.296,2.336
"clarify where he is on that, because when you met",1800.632,1.968
with big Pharma the other day -,1802.6,1.068
Mr Spicer: Right.,1803.668,1.134
"The Press: -before the meeting, he",1804.802,2.069
"said, &amp;quot;We have no choice.",1806.871,1.702
We have to get prices down.&amp;quot;,1808.573,0.734
Mr. Spicer Right.,1809.307,0.367
The Press: After the meeting he said he would,1809.674,1.235
oppose anything that makes it harder for these,1810.909,2.736
companies to bring their drugs to market including,1813.645,3.103
price fixing by Medicare.,1816.748,1.735
So is he for Medicare negotiating drug,1818.483,2.102
prices or not?,1820.585,1.034
"Mr. Spicer He&amp;#39;s for it, yes.",1821.619,0.501
He wants to make sure -,1822.12,0.467
The Press: He&amp;#39;s still for it?,1822.587,0.467
Mr. Spicer Absolutely.,1823.054,0.501
The Press: Okay.,1823.555,0.6
"Mr. Spicer The President&amp;#39;s clear - I mean, when you",1824.155,3.337
look at the cost of - not to drug cost - the US,1827.492,1.401
"government has not done - I mean, you look at what",1828.893,1.835
"other - frankly, the easier way to look at this",1830.728,1.602
is what other countries have done - negotiating,1832.33,2.035
cost to keep those done.,1834.365,1.368
"As drug prices continue to escalate, that drives up",1835.733,2.169
"healthcare costs for every American, but",1837.902,1.902
"particularly, there&amp;#39;s a huge burden on America&amp;#39;s",1839.804,1.802
seniors who are so much more reliant on drug,1841.606,2.769
"prices, and I think when - and in many cases, you",1844.375,2.503
have people living on a fixed income.,1846.878,2.102
"And healthcare costs, rising healthcare costs,",1848.98,2.236
and prescription drugs continue to be a burden on,1851.216,2.535
their ability to live out their lives in a much more,1853.751,3.037
"enjoyable manner, and so -",1856.788,1.034
The Press: Sean?,1857.822,0.3
Mr. Spicer - his commitment is to make sure,1858.122,1.669
"that he does what he can, and I think rather",1859.791,2.202
successfully uses his skills as a businessman to,1861.993,2.102
drive them down.,1864.095,0.734
Margaret.,1864.829,0.467
"The Press: Sean, can you clarify a few things?",1865.296,2.303
Mr. Spicer Sure.,1867.599,0.4
The Press: Secretary Carrie.,1867.999,0.834
Kelly - excuse me -when he was on the Hill today said,1868.833,2.836
that the administration right now is not looking,1871.669,2.636
at adding other countries to this temporary,1874.305,3.337
travel ban list.,1877.642,0.934
Is the White House still giving itself room to,1878.576,3.237
add some countries to that list?,1881.813,1.902
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I didn&amp;#39;t - what his point is that",1883.715,3.136
right now he&amp;#39;s not doing it.,1886.851,1.168
You have to look at his testimony in context.,1888.019,1.668
I think he went through the fact that we&amp;#39;re still,1889.687,3.037
"in this review process, that he is committed to",1892.724,2.836
"making sure that we look at all other countries,",1895.56,2.202
"but as of this moment, there&amp;#39;s no immediate",1897.762,3.37

"the other countries, the procedures that we have",1904.002,1.701
"with them, the systems that we have in place to",1905.703,1.902
"check them, and so it&amp;#39;s - nothing is final until the",1907.605,2.97
end of the review period.,1910.575,1.168
Yeah?,1911.743,0.534
The Press: But I had a second question - sorry.,1912.277,2.068
"Mr. Spicer Oh, I&amp;#39;m sorry.",1914.345,0.534
The Press: So you said they&amp;#39;re still leaving,1914.879,1.535
room to do that.,1916.414,0.701
Something that the President continues to say,1917.115,2.435
"as a phrase, and I&amp;#39;m hoping you can define it",1919.55,2.336
"for us, is that this is about &amp;quot;testing who truly",1921.886,3.137
"loves America, and making sure that those who enter",1925.023,2.202
the country are those who truly love America.&amp;quot;,1927.225,3.003
How do you quantify that?,1930.228,1.802
What does the President thinking of?,1932.03,1.368
Is that a specific test?,1933.398,1.401
What does that mean?,1934.799,1.201
Mr. Spicer No.,1936,0.501
I mean - look - I think the President&amp;#39;s goal is to,1936.501,4.638
make sure that people aren&amp;#39;t coming here to do,1941.139,2.035
"us harm, that they&amp;#39;re going through the proper,",1943.174,2.002
extreme vetting in cases where we don&amp;#39;t have the,1945.176,2.97
information required to make a good judgment on,1948.146,1.968
them based on what their other - what their country,1950.114,1.702
is willing to provide.,1951.816,1.268
"That we are taking the proper, necessary steps to",1953.084,2.803
"protect our people, but he doesn&amp;#39;t - if someone&amp;#39;s",1955.887,2.469
coming here to do us harm or to espouse things that,1958.356,5.439
would give us a good indication that they&amp;#39;re,1963.795,2.369
"not coming here for the right reasons, then we",1966.164,2.068
"need to do everything we can to a) vet them, and b)",1968.232,2.736
"unless we&amp;#39;re 100 percent certain, keep them",1970.968,1.969
out of the country.,1972.937,0.801
The Press: So it&amp;#39;s a background check?,1973.738,1.201
"Mr. Spicer It&amp;#39;s a background check, but",1974.939,1.335
"again, I wouldn&amp;#39;t just - it&amp;#39;s not.",1976.274,1.368
It is to the extent that we can it&amp;#39;s going to be,1977.642,1.668
extreme vetting is what he&amp;#39;s talked about.,1979.31,1.769
That it&amp;#39;s not going to be just letting someone,1981.079,2.202
in on a quick check.,1983.281,1.134
"If there&amp;#39;s any cause for concern, he wants to go to",1984.415,3.37
every step possible to make sure that people who,1987.785,2.436
are entering this country are doing so because they,1990.221,2.603
want to come here for the right reasons and,1992.824,2.435
for peaceful reasons.,1995.259,1.202
Yeah.,1996.461,0.333
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",1996.794,0.668
[inaudible] very good friend [inaudible] the,1997.462,14.281

Male Speaker: Most important part of policy?,2023.121,1.001
Mr. Spicer He had a conversation the other,2024.122,2.836
"day, and we look forward to filling",2026.958,2.202
that conversation.,2029.16,0.667
"I think, obviously, the threat of North Korea is",2029.827,2.803
the most prominent issue that faces South Korea and,2032.63,2.803
our alliance right now.,2035.433,1.268
"He wants to reassure the South Korean government,",2036.701,2.102
"the Blue House, that we are going to do what we",2038.803,2.002
can to make sure that we stand with South Korea and,2040.805,3.136
that we prevent any further hostile actions,2043.941,2.036
from North Korea.,2045.977,1.501
"So I think that - that safety of our country, of",2047.478,3.47
"South Korea, of the region are going to be",2050.948,1.836
clearly the greatest focus of this.,2052.784,2.068
The Press: Quick question.,2054.852,2.069
"John Christy, Real Talk Media News.",2056.921,0.601
"When the President submits his budget, is he",2057.522,2.235
committed to pushing Congress to approve,2059.757,1.835
sufficient funding for all American students to have,2061.592,3.17
either an outstanding public school education or,2064.762,3.037
the public funding for them to reach an,2067.799,2.302
outstanding private school education?,2070.101,1.335
Mr. Spicer Look - I think the President has talked,2071.436,1.334
extensively about education during the,2072.77,2.87
primary that it&amp;#39;s - whether it&amp;#39;s an,2075.64,3.904
"Associate&amp;#39;s Degree, a Bachelor&amp;#39;s degree, PhD, or",2079.544,2.769
"vo-technical education, that we&amp;#39;ve got to give",2082.313,2.669
students these days the options they need,2084.982,3.37
for the workforce.,2088.352,0.768
That a vo-tech education in some cases is what&amp;#39;s in,2089.12,4.304
the interest of students in terms of their success,2093.424,2.302
"in giving them the skills to, you know, work on",2095.726,2.67
"cars, or become a computer engineer, or whatever.",2098.396,2.135
But as we head into - as we look towards the future,2100.531,3.938
- we&amp;#39;ve got to make sure that we&amp;#39;re preparing our,2104.469,1.368
students to have the skill set that they need.,2105.837,1.968
And it&amp;#39;s also the retraining aspect of that.,2107.805,2.269
That as people get older and certain industries,2110.074,2.569
start to turn the corner because of technology that,2112.643,2.036
we&amp;#39;re allowing people the opportunity for retraining,2114.679,2.536
to give them the skill set that they need to reenter,2117.215,2.102
"the workforce and continue to be productive, so I",2119.317,2.536
"think, as you will see - look - we will literally",2121.853,3.103
"swear in the Secretary of Education, hopefully,",2124.956,3.27
"later this evening, which we will let you all know,",2128.226,2.035
probably around the 5 or 6 o&amp;#39;clock hour.,2130.261,2.236
But that will be something that he&amp;#39;s going to,2132.497,1.368
continue to have a conversation with,2133.865,1.334
Secretary DeVos about.,2135.199,0.934
"Something that she&amp;#39;s made clear, and it&amp;#39;s",2136.133,1.869
unfortunately that we haven&amp;#39;t been able to have,2138.002,2.503
"this conversation sooner, because it was held up for",2140.505,1.368
"so long, but I think that&amp;#39;s something that",2141.873,2.469
Secretary DeVos will be speaking a lot about -,2144.342,2.903
about the education funding and skill set and,2147.245,2.969
"opportunities that we give, not just our",2150.214,1.568
"children, but people older in life who are looking to",2151.782,2.269

The youngsters?,2157.922,0.634
Mr. Spicer Right.,2158.556,0.5
I think we&amp;#39;ll have plenty of time to discuss the,2159.056,1.535
President&amp;#39;s budget as we get closer - as he sort,2160.591,2.236
of develops that.,2162.827,0.667
Today we&amp;#39;re excited that Secretary DeVos will get,2163.494,2.403
