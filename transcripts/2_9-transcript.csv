Mr. Spicer: Here we go.,0,4.471
"Good afternoon, everyone.",4.471,2.502
Appreciate that help.,6.973,1.835
"As you just saw, the President was honored to",8.808,2.403
host the swearing-in of Attorney General Sessions,11.211,3.17
in the Oval Office just a short time ago.,14.381,2.736
"Under Attorney General Sessions, the Justice",17.117,1.768
"Department will return to its original, core",18.885,2.135
mission: to uphold the rule of law to ensure that,21.02,3.17
justice is administered and enforced fairly and,24.19,2.336
impartially for all Americans.,26.526,1.869
Attorney General Sessions -- come on in.,28.395,3.036
Unknown Speaker: A little crowded.,31.431,1.535
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sorry.,32.966,1.301
"Well, you know, it&amp;#39;s a Trump briefing.",34.267,2.903
Attorney General Sessions is a world-class legal,37.17,1.935
"mind and experienced prosecutor, and the",39.105,2.102
President is pleased to have him finally in place,41.207,2.203
as our nation&amp;#39;s top law enforcement officer.,43.41,2.669
"After the Attorney General&amp;#39;s swearing-in, the",46.079,1.568
President signed three executive orders dedicated,47.647,2.669
to standing behind the police officers who risk,50.316,1.836
their lives every day to protect us and our,52.152,1.968
"communities, reducing crime, and stopping",54.12,2.436
cartel violence.,56.556,1.435
The first executive order directs the newly,57.991,2.102
installed Attorney General to develop a strategy for,60.093,2.803
more effectively prosecuting people who,62.896,1.868
commit violence against members,64.764,1.702
of law enforcement.,66.466,1.468
We must better protect those who protect us.,67.934,2.469
Our men and women in blue need to know that we&amp;#39;re,70.403,1.769
with them 100 percent as they patrol our streets.,72.172,3.203
"Unfortunately, this has not always been the case.",75.375,2.502
Law enforcement officials have been vocal about the,77.877,2.87
lack of support they received under the,80.747,2.069
past administration.,82.816,1.434
This lack of support demoralized many officers,84.25,2.536
"and, in some cases, led to their discouraging their",86.786,2.67
"engagement with local communities, only causing",89.456,3.603
further harm and deterioration.,93.059,1.902
"It&amp;#39;s imperative that federal, state, and local",94.961,1.969
law enforcement agencies better coordinate and,96.93,2.469
share information across jurisdictions to better,99.399,2.936
serve and protect our communities.,102.335,2.436
This order will start the important work of doing,104.771,2.102
"just that, instituting a holistic approach that",106.873,2.703
involves the whole of government.,109.576,1.735
It also directs the Department of Justice to,111.311,1.935
work with other federal agencies to come up with,113.246,2.703
ways to further reduce violence against law,115.949,1.968
"enforcement, and orders a hard look at how the",117.917,2.369
Department of Justice and other agencies use their,120.286,2.57
law enforcement grants.,122.856,1.701
"The second order establishes a task force,",124.557,2.303
"led by the new Attorney General, to reduce crime",126.86,2.702
and restore public safety,129.562,1.402
in communities across America.,130.964,2.536
"Together, the members of this task force are going",133.5,2.135
to come up with specific recommendations: how we,135.635,2.336
can change existing federal law to better,137.971,2.269
"prevent crime and improve public safety, and develop",140.24,3.303
stronger working relationships with our,143.543,1.735
state and local partners.,145.278,1.768
The President is confident that this task force will,147.046,1.769
develop a systematic strategy to help further,148.815,2.669
protect the American people.,151.484,1.668
Communities across our nation have been,153.152,1.402
"devastated by a surge in violent-crime rates,",154.554,1.969
particularly in our major cities.,156.523,2.135
"Over the last eight years, we&amp;#39;ve experienced",158.658,1.735
declining focus on law and order.,160.393,2.169
Crime reduction will clearly be a priority for,162.562,2.803
this White House.,165.365,1.234
The last executive order re-focuses the energy and,166.599,2.336
resources of the federal government to dismantle,168.935,2.269
"transnational criminal organizations,",171.204,2.135
such as drug cartels.,173.339,1.735
It&amp;#39;s important to emphasize that we cannot,175.074,1.702
reduce crime in the United States without,176.776,2.302
additionally addressing illegal immigration,179.078,1.836
and illegal drugs.,180.914,1.468
"Through this executive order, the President",182.382,1.701
instructs the Attorney General to form a,184.083,1.902
comprehensive and decisive,185.985,1.535
approach to destroying transnational crime,187.52,2.569
organizations and drug cartels.,190.089,2.436
These cartels represent a clear and present danger,192.525,2.87
to our nation.,195.395,1.134
"They bring dangerous criminals, drugs, and",196.529,2.102
violence to once-peaceful neighborhoods both here at,198.631,2.803
home and in other parts of the world.,201.434,1.969
"They have fueled addiction and overdose deaths, and",203.403,2.869
they can no longer be allowed to operate with,206.272,1.835
impunity in our country or our hemisphere.,208.107,3.137
This order pulls together the experience and,211.244,1.868
resources of federal agencies to work towards,213.112,2.67
emphasizing specific goals in this regard.,215.782,2.569
"Number one, to upgrade our information-gathering",218.351,2.502
about these transnational organizations and cartels.,220.853,3.137
Without accurate information about these,223.99,1.868
"threats, and the ability and willingness to share",225.858,1.936
"this information, we&amp;#39;re not going to be able to",227.794,1.802
tackle this problem.,229.596,1.167
"It&amp;#39;s important to note that, prior to this",230.763,2.403
"administration, if you had called the Department of",233.166,1.868
"Justice to ask for these statistics,",235.034,2.036
they never kept them.,237.07,1.134
So knowing what we&amp;#39;re facing is a big part of,238.204,2.302
addressing the problem.,240.506,1.469
"Number two, improving the speed and efficiency of",241.975,2.702
"removing criminal aliens, cartel members, and people",244.677,3.17
who help cartels from our nation.,247.847,2.069
"Unlike during the last eight years, these",249.916,1.501
criminals are finally going to go home.,251.417,2.536
"Shift -- three, shift whatever resources we can",253.953,3.137
to tackling these organizations and prevent,257.09,2.202
them from disrupting our society any further.,259.292,3.403
"Now, on to the President&amp;#39;s schedule.",262.695,1.835
"This morning, the President held a breakfast",264.53,1.502
and listening session with key stakeholders in the,266.032,2.336
airline industry.,268.368,0.734
We&amp;#39;ve got a participation -- participant list if,269.102,2.736
you&amp;#39;re interested.,271.838,0.667
The President thanked the attendees for the 10,272.505,2.669
million jobs and $1 trillion in annual,275.174,2.102
"economic activity they contribute to our economy,",277.276,4.372
and praised them for moving approximately 2,281.648,1.601
million passengers per day in spite of the outdated,283.249,2.803
infrastructure and equipment that they have,286.052,1.902
with -- in terms of air traffic control and other,287.954,4.104
infrastructure measures.,292.058,1.435
The President asked the aviation leaders what the,293.493,2.235
government can do to help their industry grow and,295.728,2.102
create more well-paying jobs for Americans.,297.83,2.57
The leaders commented that they had never been given,300.4,1.935
the opportunity to truly work alongside the,302.335,1.501
President in such an open and constructive way.,303.836,2.703
And they were unanimous in asking for the President,306.539,1.802
to offer relief from the duplicative and burdensome,308.341,3.003
"regulations that are stifling job creation,",311.344,2.436
which he assured them he&amp;#39;d do.,313.78,1.668
The President also reaffirmed his commitment,315.448,2.035
"to foregoing -- to forging, rather,",317.483,2.77
public-private partnerships that will,320.253,2.035
rebuild America&amp;#39;s crumbling infrastructure.,322.288,2.436
He pledged to work closely with the airline industry,324.724,2.002
to modernize the technology systems that,326.726,2.402
"keep our nation&amp;#39;s airports running, and to expedite",329.128,2.703
the approval process for future airline,331.831,1.935
infrastructure projects.,333.766,1.735
It&amp;#39;s the President&amp;#39;s goal to make sure the United,335.501,1.869
States has the most advanced airline system in,337.37,1.802
"the world, and this meeting was an important",339.172,2.068
first step in achieving that.,341.24,3.137
"After the executive order signing, the President",344.377,1.935
spoke with the President of Afghanistan and,346.312,2.102
the Emir of Qatar.,348.414,1.402
My understanding is that we should have readouts,349.816,1.601
shortly on both of those calls.,351.417,2.336
"Just concluding, a few moments ago the President",353.753,3.036
held a Supreme Court and legislative listening,356.789,2.636
session and lunch with,359.425,1.468
Democratic and Republican senators.,360.893,1.836
In attendance were Chairman of the Judiciary,362.729,1.701
"Committee, Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa; Senator",364.43,3.504
Heitkamp of North Dakota; Senator Tester of Montana;,367.934,3.537
Senator Donnelly of Indiana; Senator Manchin,371.471,2.802
"of West Virginia; Senator Moore Capito, also of West",374.273,3.37
Virginia; Senator Cornyn of Texas; Senator,377.643,2.67
"Alexander Of Tennessee; Senator Coons of Delaware,",380.313,3.403
and Senator Bennet of Colorado.,383.716,2.169
The President expressed his hope that these,385.885,2.369
senators and their colleagues will give Judge,388.254,2.035
Gorsuch a fair consideration and vote,390.289,2.636
based on his qualifications to serve on,392.925,1.735
the Supreme Court.,394.66,1.302
With over 100 federal judicial nominations,395.962,3.036
potentially happening during this,398.998,1.735
"administration, it&amp;#39;s critical for us to have",400.733,2.336
open dialogue and work towards bipartisan,403.069,1.935
agreement so that our justice system returns to,405.004,2.503
its important work on,407.507,0.934
behalf of the American people.,408.441,1.668
"Later today, the President will speak with the Emir",410.109,1.935
of Kuwait and the Prime Minister of Iraq.,412.044,2.47
He will provide readouts -- or we will provide,414.514,1.701
readouts of those calls moving towards the,416.215,1.468
conclusion of them.,417.683,1.202
We also anticipate that the Senate will hold a,418.885,1.635
vote to confirm Secretary-designate Price,420.52,2.535
this evening or into the early hours of Friday to,423.055,2.77
be the next Secretary of Health and Human Services.,425.825,2.869
The President was glad to see that the Army Corps of,428.694,2.069
Engineers announced last night the final easement,430.763,2.236
for the Dakota Access Pipeline.,432.999,2.369
"With this final federal authorization completed,",435.368,2.669
and the President working to reduce further,438.037,3.37
"unnecessary delays, this infrastructure project can",441.407,2.77
finally continue to move forward.,444.177,1.901
The construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline was,446.078,2.636
one of the President&amp;#39;s campaign promises and the,448.714,2.236
subject of one of his first executive orders.,450.95,2.536
The administration is pleased that Americans,453.486,2.569
"will be going to work building this pipeline,",456.055,2.102
and building it with,458.157,0.668
American steel whenever possible.,458.825,2.135
"Now, looking to the upcoming schedule.",460.96,1.869
"Tomorrow, the President will welcome Prime",462.829,1.601
Minister Abe of Japan.,464.43,1.602
The President and the Prime Minister will hold a,466.032,1.334
press conference at 1:00 p.m.,467.366,1.936
in the East Room.,469.302,1.101
They will depart Washington around 3:00,470.403,1.968
"tomorrow afternoon for Mar-A-Lago, where the",472.371,2.203
President is honored to host the Prime Minister at,474.574,3.003
the Winter White House.,477.577,1.268
"As we recently announced just earlier today, Prime",478.845,3.47
Minister Trudeau of Canada will visit,482.315,1.568
the White House on Monday.,483.883,1.535
The President looks forward to a constructive,485.418,1.668
conversation and strengthening the deep,487.086,2.169
relationship that exists between the,489.255,1.335
United States and Canada.,490.59,1.534
The President will also host Prime Minister,492.124,1.602
Netanyahu of Israel next Wednesday.,493.726,2.569
We&amp;#39;ll have further guidance on the press,496.295,1.669
availability potentials for either one of those.,497.964,2.569
"One last thing before I take your questions, amid",500.533,1.835
surging levels of CEO confidence and in the wake,502.368,2.97
of the incredible jobs announcement made at the,505.338,2.002
"White House yesterday by Intel, there&amp;#39;s also new",507.34,2.769
numbers released today by the Department of Labor,510.109,1.769
showing that unemployment,511.878,1.167
claims are at near historic lows.,513.045,3.17
The President knows better than anyone what,516.215,1.502
"businesses need to create jobs, and the market is",517.717,2.469
responding to his policy improvements.,520.186,2.436
This administration will continue to roll back,522.622,1.735
burdensome regulations and lower the overall tax,524.357,2.669
burden on Americans so they can hire even more,527.026,2.469
people and create even more innovative projects.,529.495,2.936
"With that, I&amp;#39;ll take your questions.",532.431,1.769
Kaitlan Collins.,534.2,0.834
The Press: Thank you.,535.034,1.201
Hundreds of bureaucrats at the Consumer Financial,536.235,2.136
Protection Bureau make,538.371,0.901
more than members of Congress.,539.272,1.534
Forty of them make more,540.806,1.502
than Vice President Mike Pence.,542.308,1.535
Does the President have,543.843,1.201
plans to revamp this agency?,545.044,1.535
"And if so, does he feel that he should be able to",546.579,3.77
fire the head of the agency at his will?,550.349,2.436
"Mr. Spicer: I think I&amp;#39;ve addressed this before, but",552.785,2.369
we have no updates right now on the head of CFPB.,555.154,4.004
"As we -- If we do, I&amp;#39;ll let you know.",559.158,2.77
"With respect to the first part of that question, I",561.928,1.835
think one of the things that you&amp;#39;re going to,563.763,1.434
continue to see from this President is a respect for,565.197,3.304
"taxpayers&amp;#39; dollars, the money they spend, and",568.501,2.302
how they&amp;#39;re spent.,570.803,0.934
We are going to continue to review all,571.737,1.936
aspects of government.,573.673,1.201
I think you&amp;#39;ll see further announcements as far as,574.874,1.802
how he&amp;#39;s going to look at -- how he&amp;#39;s going to,576.676,2.235
approach and innovate and update government.,578.911,3.203
The bottom line is that we should be paying people a,582.114,2.102
"fair wage for their service to this country,",584.216,2.203
but that we should doing it in the most effective,586.419,1.601
and efficient manner.,588.02,0.668
And I think that&amp;#39;s what the President has already,588.688,2.068
shown towards his commitment towards helping,590.756,2.87
reduce the cost of several programs through the,593.626,2.869
government and bringing back jobs.,596.495,2.136
But there&amp;#39;s going to be a respect for taxpayers in,598.631,1.835
"this administration, so that whether it&amp;#39;s salaries",600.466,3.103
"or actual positions or programs, he&amp;#39;s going to",603.569,3.504
"have a very, very tough look at how we&amp;#39;re",607.073,2.202
"operating government, how many positions they&amp;#39;re in,",609.275,2.335
what people are getting paid.,611.61,1.802
But the President understands that most,613.412,1.769
Americans are out there working night and day,615.181,2.502
"trying to get by, and that Washington truly needs to",617.683,2.87
"respect the money that they spend, and that we",620.553,2.102
should be doing it in a way that shows that --,622.655,3.003
with a level of respect in terms of how many people,625.658,1.868
"are hiring, what they&amp;#39;re paid, what programs we&amp;#39;re",627.526,2.57
"looking at, whether or not that program",630.096,1.468
is duplicative.,631.564,0.901
But it&amp;#39;s not just about one department,632.465,1.768
or one agency.,634.233,1.268
It&amp;#39;s really about looking at how government as a,635.501,1.702
whole operates. John.,637.203,2.102
"The Press: Sean, questions have been raised after",639.305,3.303
"Kellyanne Conway did an interview, I believe it",642.608,1.869
"was with Fox News this morning, where she",644.477,2.769
"appeared to, from the confines of the Brady",647.246,2.97
"Briefing room, promote the products of Ivanka Trump.",650.216,3.036
Do you believe that she crossed an ethical line?,653.252,2.236
Mr. Spicer: Kellyanne has been counseled and that&amp;#39;s,655.488,3.203
all we&amp;#39;re going to go with.,658.691,1.268
"She&amp;#39;s been counseled on that subject,",659.959,2.436
and that&amp;#39;s it.,662.395,0.667
The Press: And could I ask a question.,663.062,4.137
Reuters has a story out that includes a partial,667.199,2.536
transcript of the President&amp;#39;s call with,669.735,2.336
"Vladimir Putin, in which he appears to express",672.071,3.07
doubts about the New START Treaty.,675.141,2.302
Does he indeed have doubts about the,677.443,1.568
New START Treaty?,679.011,0.734
Would he like to see that renegotiated?,679.745,2.202
Mr. Spicer: The President&amp;#39;s conversation,681.947,1.569
with President Putin is a private call between the,683.516,2.035
"two of them, and I&amp;#39;m going to leave it at that.",685.551,1.735
"We put a readout on the call, and we have nothing",687.286,3.07
further beyond that.,690.356,0.967
John Gizzi.,691.323,0.668
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",691.991,1.935
One question today.,693.926,1.635
Mr. Spicer: Wow.,695.561,1.335
"The Press: (laughter) On February 2nd, Vladimir",696.896,3.136
"Kara-Murza, who is a well-known filmmaker in",700.032,3.103
Russia and was a close associate of the late,703.135,4.038
"Boris Nemtsov, the dissident, found himself",707.173,2.669
in critical condition.,709.842,1.335
His wife has since said she believes this is,711.177,4.004
"poisoning, very much like the conditions that almost",715.181,3.57
took his life two years ago.,718.751,2.669
And does the administration have any,721.42,2.67
"comment about that, or the frustration of",724.09,3.136
"Mr. Navalny, the opponent of President Putin to get",727.226,4.004
on the ballot as a candidate?,731.23,2.669
Mr. Spicer: I think our State Department is aware,733.899,4.038
"of the situation, we&amp;#39;re monitoring it, and I&amp;#39;ll",737.937,4.037
leave it at that. Blake.,741.974,0.868
"The Press: Sean, the President said today in",742.842,2.869
the airlines representative meeting,745.711,1.435
that he hopes to have an announcement within the,747.146,3.203
next two to three weeks about lowering the burden,750.349,3.203
of taxes for businesses.,753.552,1.435
"At the Super Bowl interview, he was asked,",754.987,2.169
"can Americans expect a tax break in 2017, and he",757.156,4.004
"said, &amp;quot;I think so, yes.",761.16,1.535
I would like to say yes.&amp;quot; It sounds like he&amp;#39;s a,762.695,3.403
little bit more confident for the businesses than,766.098,2.469
individual tax breaks for Americans.,768.567,1.535
Is the business component at this point ahead of the,770.102,2.803
individual component?,772.905,1.068
"Mr. Spicer: No, it&amp;#39;s a comprehensive -- yeah --",773.973,1.401
thanks for asking.,775.374,0.667
"I think we&amp;#39;re looking at, in the next few weeks,",776.041,1.469
rolling out the outline of a comprehensive tax plan,777.51,2.736
that we&amp;#39;ve been continuing to work -- that we&amp;#39;ll be,780.246,1.368
"working with Congress on that will address, quote,",781.614,2.202
&amp;quot;the business side of the tax ledger as well as the,783.816,4.071
individual rates.&amp;quot; But it&amp;#39;s going to be a,787.887,1.635
"comprehensive plan, something that we haven&amp;#39;t",789.522,1.368
seen since 1986.,790.89,1.368
"But I think when you look at the segueing of that,",792.258,2.636
we&amp;#39;ve got two opportunities for,794.894,1.101
reconciliation this year.,795.995,1.668
"One is using the FY17 budget, which you can",797.663,2.803
"easily get Obamacare repeal and replace done,",800.466,2.536
and then you can use the FY18 budget to utilize the,803.002,4.337
second opportunity at reconciliation to do,807.339,2.536
comprehensive reform.,809.875,1.268
But we recognize the need.,811.143,1.435
"I mean, it&amp;#39;s been since 1986 that something like",812.578,3.236
"this, of this scale and magnitude, has happened.",815.814,2.403
The President recognizes that middle-class,818.217,1.835
"Americans need tax relief, and that&amp;#39;s going",820.052,3.77
to be part of that.,823.822,0.668
But we also recognize -- and you saw that in all of,824.49,2.335
"these businesses meetings, whether it&amp;#39;s inversions or",826.825,2.236
other means in which people are shipping jobs,829.061,1.969
overseas or reestablishing themselves or the profits,831.03,3.103
"that are kept over there -- we need fundamental,",834.133,2.335
comprehensive tax reform that addresses both sides,836.468,2.803
of those -- of that income stream.,839.271,1.769
The Press: Can you say if this is going to be a mix,841.04,2.102
between what he had put out there on the campaign,843.142,2.702
and what House Republicans had put out there before?,845.844,2.036
Because there&amp;#39;s some similarities but clearly,847.88,2.436
some differences as well.,850.316,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m just going to say that you&amp;#39;re going,850.983,1.335
to have to wait a couple weeks before we,852.318,1.334
put out that outline.,853.652,0.701
But I can tell you that it&amp;#39;s something that is,854.353,2.569
going to spur economic growth.,856.922,1.201
It&amp;#39;s going to recognize the need to give so many,858.123,3.871
working Americans the relief that they need.,861.994,2.102
"But more importantly, I think part of the issue",864.096,2.136
that we continue to see over and over again with,866.232,2.435
businesses is that we&amp;#39;re facing competition from,868.667,2.336
abroad because of our tax code.,871.003,3.07
"It favors companies from not wanting to stay, and",874.073,3.27
the President recognizes that.,877.343,1.301
And what he wants to do is create a tax climate that,878.644,2.703
not only keeps jobs here but makes it --,881.347,2.302
"incentivizes companies to want to come here, to grow",883.649,3.17
"here, to create jobs here, to bring their",886.819,2.602
profits back here.,889.421,1.135
So I think -- I don&amp;#39;t want to get any further ahead,890.556,2.569
"of it, but I will tell you that it is going to be the",893.125,2.102
first time that this nation has seen a full,895.227,1.869
"comprehensive tax reform in a long, long time. Yes.",897.096,2.536
"The Press: Yes, the President this morning",899.632,2.869
tweeted that our country is &amp;quot;bogged down in,902.501,2.903
conflict all over the place.&amp;quot;,905.404,1.702
Where are we bogged down?,907.106,0.901
Mr. Spicer: I think there are several places,908.007,1.334
that we&amp;#39;ve been --,909.341,0.668
The Press: What does he mean by that?,910.009,1.334
Mr. Spicer: I think that if you look at ISIS in,911.343,1.969
particular and the hotspots around the,913.312,3.236
"country, the places that we have to monitor,",916.548,2.203
there&amp;#39;s a lot of countries through the Middle East in,918.751,3.537
particular -- Northern Africa -- that we are,922.288,2.068
having to address and deal with and monitor because,924.356,2.67
of the threat of radical Islamic terrorism.,927.026,2.235
There&amp;#39;s no question that the spread of it has gone,929.261,3.971
-- in the last eight years has proliferated.,933.232,2.836
And I think that the resources that we have to,936.068,1.735
spend -- this isn&amp;#39;t a traditional war where,937.803,2.169
you&amp;#39;re just looking at the other enemy with a uniform,939.972,3.37
"and saying, here&amp;#39;s the country we&amp;#39;re fighting.",943.342,2.302
The proliferation of ISIS throughout this country,945.644,3.47
has made it so that we have to focus a lot more,949.114,2.436
in a lot more places and expend a lot more,951.55,2.069
resources because it&amp;#39;s more of a disparate,953.619,2.235
"approach that we have to employ, as opposed to",955.854,2.47
having one country that you&amp;#39;re facing at one time.,958.324,2.402
The Press: But &amp;quot;bogged down&amp;quot; suggests it&amp;#39;s,960.726,3.637
something we can&amp;#39;t get out of?,964.363,2.169
Mr. Spicer: I just answered the question.,966.532,2.502
I understand.,969.034,0.701
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",969.735,1.802
And happy Lantern Festival to you.,971.537,2.135
Mr. Spicer: Happy Lantern Festival to you.,973.672,2.503
The Press: Thank you and regarding the very nice,976.175,3.203
letter that President Trump sent to President Xi,979.378,2.869
"Jinping last night, I&amp;#39;m curious about the timing.",982.247,2.837
"And also in a letter, President Trump said he&amp;#39;s",985.084,3.236
looking forward to the event of constructive,988.32,2.503
relationship with China.,990.823,1.067
So could you elaborate the importance of this,991.89,2.87
bilateral relationship to the U.S.?,994.76,1.768
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think",996.528,1.836
it&amp;#39;s obviously important to us.,998.364,1.234
And the President understands that.,999.598,1.335
"I think he&amp;#39;s spoken fairly often about China, and he",1000.933,3.703
understands both the national and economic,1004.636,2.803
"interests that we have, the desire for our",1007.439,3.337
"companies to access the Chinese market, but also",1010.776,3.103
the national security interests that we have.,1013.879,2.636
And so he obviously wants to do what he can to have,1016.515,3.403
a fruitful and constructive relationship,1019.918,2.069
"with China, and he looks forward to developing that",1021.987,3.003
as we go forward. Sarah.,1024.99,1.902
"The Press: Sean, the top U.S.",1026.892,1.935
commander in Afghanistan said today that they could,1028.827,3.537
use a few thousand more troops in Afghanistan to,1032.364,2.836
help the coalition efforts there.,1035.2,1.835
"Going off Mike&amp;#39;s question, if we&amp;#39;re trying to get out",1037.035,2.837
"of conflicts like that, does the administration",1039.872,2.002
plan to send those additional forces to,1041.874,2.035
Afghanistan?,1043.909,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I think the President will heed the,1044.576,1.735
advice of the generals and Secretary Mattis.,1046.311,3.237
That conversation has yet to happen -- and if we,1049.548,2.302
have any further announcements.,1051.85,0.935
But I think that&amp;#39;s right now a Department of,1052.785,2.168
Defense issue that we can -- that you should,1054.953,1.936
touch base with. Hallie.,1056.889,0.967
"The Press: Sean, two questions for you.",1057.856,1.669
I want to get to one on immigration.,1059.525,1.902
But first on the comments from Judge Gorsuch that,1061.427,2.135
"have been reported out, I just have a two-parter.",1063.562,2.135
But does the President,1065.697,0.968
still stand by his nomination?,1066.665,1.168
Mr. Spicer: Absolutely.,1067.833,0.734
The Press: Given where Gorsuch stands --,1068.567,1.668
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s number one?,1070.235,1.168
"The Press: No, the second part of a two-part.",1071.403,2.169
Mr. Spicer: Oh.,1073.572,0.701
(Laughter.),1074.273,0.667
The Press: Given where --,1074.94,0.767
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not calling on you anymore.,1075.707,1.902
The Press: Given Judge Gorsuch&amp;#39;s position on the,1077.609,2.002
"President&amp;#39;s attitude toward the judiciary, and",1079.611,1.769
given that the President has praised Neil Gorsuch,1081.38,2.102
"for his intellect and for his integrity, does the",1083.482,2.569
President have any regrets about the comments that,1086.051,2.302
he&amp;#39;s made about federal judges?,1088.353,1.402
Mr. Spicer: I think the President&amp;#39;s comments speak,1089.755,2.369
"for -- no, he has no regrets.",1092.124,1.735
"But he&amp;#39;s very proud of the selection that he&amp;#39;s made,",1093.859,2.135
and he&amp;#39;s going to make a great associate justice to,1095.994,1.836
the Supreme Court.,1097.83,0.667
"The Press: Now about the selection, but about the",1098.497,2.369
"comments that he said, for example, about Judge --",1100.866,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: I understand that, I just --",1102.201,1.334
he has no regrets.,1103.535,0.668
Thank you.,1104.203,0.667
"The Press: On immigration, Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos --",1104.87,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: Look what you started, April Ryan.",1106.205,1.368
The Press: Why are you calling me out?,1107.573,1.334
I didn&amp;#39;t do anything.,1108.907,0.668
(Laughter.),1109.575,0.667
"The Press: I know the White House, I&amp;#39;m sure, has",1110.242,1.335
been following the situation of Guadalupe,1111.577,1.334
Garcia de Rayos.,1112.911,0.668
"And so I want to know, does the President believe",1113.579,1.334
she should have been deported?,1114.913,4.972
And what message does,1119.885,0.834
he have to others in her position?,1120.719,1.702
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, I&amp;#39;m going to refer you back to",1122.421,1.334
ICE on that.,1123.755,0.668
That&amp;#39;s an ICE matter.,1124.423,0.667
The Press: The President has no comment?,1125.09,1.335
Mr. Spicer: The issue is developing in Arizona,1126.425,1.535
"right now, and I would refer you back to ICE. Margaret.",1127.96,2.903
"The Press: She&amp;#39;s in Mexico right now, though.",1130.863,1.334
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;d refer you back to ICE.,1132.197,1.335
"The Press: Sean, in that lunch meeting, the",1133.532,1.335
"President said that -- you know, he basically said",1134.867,2.502
Senator Blumenthal&amp;#39;s comments were taken out of,1137.369,2.302
"context, and that --",1139.671,1.302
"Mr. Spicer: Well, no, Judge Gorsuch&amp;#39;s comments",1140.973,2.302
were -- yeah.,1143.275,0.968
"The Press: Judge Gorsuch, right.",1144.243,1.635
And that his relaying of Judge Gorsuch&amp;#39;s comments,1145.878,2.636
were taken out of context.,1148.514,1.601
"However, Senator Ayotte, who is working with the",1150.115,2.603
White House to help shepherd Judge Gorsuch,1152.718,1.968
"through the Hill, released a statement confirming",1154.686,1.936
"those same remarks, &amp;quot;disheartening&amp;quot;",1156.622,1.334
and &amp;quot;demoralizing.&amp;quot;,1157.956,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: Right, so here&amp;#39;s what --",1158.624,1.635
The Press: Is the President aware of that?,1160.259,2.202
Because she was in that meeting.,1162.461,1.668
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, of course he&amp;#39;s aware.",1164.129,2.236
This is what Senator Ayotte said: &amp;quot;Judge,1166.365,2.102
Gorsuch has made it very clear in all of his,1168.467,1.902
"discussions with senators, including Senator",1170.369,2.102
"Blumenthal, that he could not comment on (any)",1172.471,1.701
"specific cases, and that judicial ethics prevent",1174.172,2.737
him from commenting on political matters.,1176.909,2.068
He has also emphasized the importance of an,1178.977,1.735
"independent judiciary, and while he made clear that",1180.712,2.303
"he was not referencing any specific case, he said",1183.015,3.103
that he finds any criticism of a judge&amp;#39;s,1186.118,1.968
integrity and independence disheartening and,1188.086,2.303
demoralizing.&amp;quot;,1190.389,0.667
So there is a big difference between,1191.056,1.668
commenting on the specific comments that have been,1192.724,2.303
made in the tweet and his general philosophy about,1195.027,2.869
the judiciary and his,1197.896,0.801
respect for his fellow judges.,1198.697,1.768
That&amp;#39;s what -- and I think the senator&amp;#39;s comments,1200.465,2.77
were very clear about how,1203.235,1.201
those are two distinct issues.,1204.436,1.535
The Press: Right.,1205.971,0.667
And the judge&amp;#39;s comments as relayed through others,1206.638,1.769
were also in that context of the President&amp;#39;s attacks,1208.407,2.402
"on the judiciary, which is what the senator you just",1210.809,2.77
read out was also talking about there.,1213.579,1.935
Mr. Spicer: Right.,1215.514,0.834
"Okay, so --",1216.348,0.834
The Press: Was the President aware of that?,1217.182,1.969
Because Senator Ayotte was sitting right across from,1219.151,2.002
him when he said that those comments were,1221.153,2.235
inaccurately reported or conveyed.,1223.388,1.368
"Mr. Spicer: No, the way that Senator Blumenthal",1224.756,2.002
"characterized them, he was talking about the tweets",1226.758,2.203
and saying that he was disheartened.,1228.961,1.334
That&amp;#39;s not what the judge said.,1230.295,1.402
"He was making two very complete, distinct",1231.697,2.669
arguments about how he views the comments that he,1234.366,3.737
should not be commenting on a political matter or,1238.103,3.17
on specific things.,1241.273,0.834
"But as a whole, he doesn&amp;#39;t like attacks in",1242.107,2.97
general on the judiciary.,1245.077,1.501
It was a very distinct,1246.578,2.136
argument that he was making.,1248.714,1.368
And I think that that&amp;#39;s where I think we&amp;#39;ve got to,1250.082,1.434
"be clear, and that&amp;#39;s what Senator Ayotte was",1251.516,1.335
saying this morning.,1252.851,1.034
"Very, very different. Cecilia.",1253.885,1.435
The Press: Is he to take that on board?,1255.32,1.335
I mean --,1256.655,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Is he what?,1257.322,0.668
The Press: Is he taking that on board?,1257.99,1.334
"I mean, you just said he doesn&amp;#39;t regret his past",1259.324,2.169
attacks on the judiciary.,1261.493,0.868
Mr. Spicer: Right.,1262.361,0.667
The Press: But now you have these confirmed,1263.028,1.735
"remarks, which you were saying were exactly what",1264.763,1.735
the judge was talking about.,1266.498,1.101
"Mr. Spicer: No, no --",1267.599,1.101
The Press: And that&amp;#39;s not,1268.7,1.068
changing the President&amp;#39;s own --,1269.768,1.101
"Mr. Spicer: But hold on -- but, again, I think it&amp;#39;s",1270.869,2.569
important to understand that the judge was very,1273.438,3.237
clear that he was not commenting on any specific,1276.675,3.07
"matter, right?",1279.745,1.101
And then the he was asked about his general,1280.846,1.468
philosophy.,1282.314,1.068
So you can&amp;#39;t then take that -- equate it,1283.382,2.469
back to the specific.,1285.851,1.735
"He literally went out of his way to say, I&amp;#39;m not",1287.586,1.902
commenting on a specific instance.,1289.488,2.335
So to take what he said about a generalization and,1291.823,2.469
apply it to a specific is exactly what he was,1294.292,2.036
intending not to do.,1296.328,0.934
"The Press: In other words, the President will",1297.262,1.335
continue to speak like this.,1298.597,2.436
Mr. Spicer: Of course he will.,1301.033,0.834
The President is going to speak his mind.,1301.867,1.334
"It goes back to Thomas Jefferson, that Presidents",1303.201,2.169
have commented on judicial nominees.,1305.37,2.369
"I mean, the idea of one branch talking about or",1307.739,3.671
commenting on another,1311.41,0.867
branch is as old as our republic.,1312.277,2.369
So I don&amp;#39;t know why -- and I find it interesting when,1314.646,4.138
President Obama criticized the Supreme Court for its,1318.784,3.003
"Citizens United comments in the State of the Union,",1321.787,2.736
there wasn&amp;#39;t a similar concern about that.,1324.523,2.502
The idea that this is --,1327.025,1.135
"The Press: Well, I guess the &amp;quot;so-called judge&amp;quot;",1328.16,1.501
"portion of it, the personal attack.",1329.661,1.335
Mr. Spicer: I get it.,1330.996,0.767
"I mean, look -- but at some point it seems like",1331.763,2.069
there is clearly a double standard when it&amp;#39;s -- how,1333.832,1.702
this is applied.,1335.534,1.168
"When President Obama did it, there was no concern",1336.702,2.869
from this briefing room.,1339.571,1.168
"When he does it, it&amp;#39;s a ton of outrage.",1340.739,2.636
"So I just -- with all due respect, I think the",1343.375,1.935
President has made very clear that he was,1345.31,1.635
concerned about how that executive order in,1346.945,2.236
"particular, which is what we&amp;#39;re talking about,",1349.181,1.801
was applied.,1350.982,0.701
And I think we&amp;#39;ve addressed it from this,1351.683,1.335
"briefing room over, and over, and over",1353.018,2.035
again that the U.S.,1355.053,1.335
code gives the President very clear authority to,1356.388,2.602
make this happen. Cecilia.,1358.99,1.368
The Press: I want to make sure I understand what,1360.358,1.635
you&amp;#39;re saying.,1361.993,0.701
Are you saying that &amp;quot;demoralizing&amp;quot; and,1362.694,1.335
&amp;quot;disheartening&amp;quot; was not specifically about the,1364.029,1.334
President&amp;#39;s comments and what he said?,1365.363,1.335
"And if so, how does the President know that?",1366.698,1.602
Has he spoken to the Judge?,1368.3,1.268
"Mr. Spicer: No, I think the Judge literally made",1369.568,2.335
it very clear in his comments.,1371.903,1.235
The Press: But three senators have come out and,1373.138,1.335
"said that they corroborate that statement,",1374.473,1.334
and said that --,1375.807,0.668
Mr. Spicer: I understand that.,1376.475,0.7
"Senator Ayotte, who was there, made it very clear",1377.175,1.635
that he was commenting in general about attacks,1378.81,4.004
on the judiciary.,1382.814,0.668
That was it.,1383.482,0.667
Plain and simple.,1384.149,0.667
"The Press: But three other senators have said, and",1384.816,2.269
"the spokesman and for the Judge, on the record.",1387.085,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: I understand that, Cecilia.",1388.42,1.335
"I can tell you that Senator Ayotte, who has",1389.755,1.334
"been with him on every single thing, was very",1391.089,1.335
clear about that.,1392.424,0.701
There&amp;#39;s no -- so I understand that.,1393.125,1.701
And that is -- she has made it very clear over,1394.826,2.102
and over again. Yes.,1396.928,1.836
"The Press: Sean, your answer about the context",1398.764,6.373
doesn&amp;#39;t make sense when you think about what,1405.137,1.568
Senator Ben Sasse said,1406.705,1.268
today and this morning on TV.,1407.973,1.868
He said that he asked Judge Gorsuch specifically,1409.841,2.469
about the President&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;so-called judge&amp;quot; tweet.,1412.31,1.869
And in response --,1414.179,1.234
"Mr. Spicer: Phil, this is like the fourth time I&amp;#39;ve",1415.413,2.036
asked and answered.,1417.449,1.034
"The Press: No, but this is a different context, Sean.",1418.483,2.069
Mr. Spicer: I understand that.,1420.552,0.801
"Phil, I have asked --",1421.353,0.801
The Press: This is directly about the,1422.154,1.334
President&amp;#39;s tweet.,1423.488,0.668
Mr. Spicer: I understand that.,1424.156,0.734
And I&amp;#39;ve said exactly what,1424.89,0.767
Senator Ayotte said about it.,1425.657,0.734
I don&amp;#39;t know how many times you guys --,1426.391,1.335
The Press: But her comment was only about Blumenthal.,1427.726,1.334
"Mr. Spicer: I understand, thank you.",1429.06,1.335
"The Press: Sean, I&amp;#39;m going to continue on this line,",1430.395,1.368
despite what was just happening there.,1431.763,1.335
"Why isn&amp;#39;t the White House, why isn&amp;#39;t the President",1433.098,2.069
concerned about the influence or the,1435.167,3.336
appearance of the influence on the,1438.503,2.202
independent judiciary?,1440.705,0.868
"Mr. Spicer: Why isn&amp;#39;t he -- I mean, he is free to",1441.573,3.37
speak his mind.,1444.943,0.868
Where has this outrage been for the,1445.811,1.901
last hundred years?,1447.712,0.935
There has been --,1448.647,0.8
The Press: I&amp;#39;m not asking about the Obama,1449.447,1.335
"administration or any previous administration,",1450.782,1.335
I&amp;#39;m talking about this,1452.117,0.667
President and this White House.,1452.784,0.734
Mr. Spicer: I understand that.,1453.518,0.668
And the President has -- part of the reason the,1454.186,1.334
President got elected is because he,1455.52,1.335
speaks his mind.,1456.855,0.667
He doesn&amp;#39;t hold it back.,1457.522,0.701
He&amp;#39;s authentic.,1458.223,0.667
"And he&amp;#39;s not going to sit back, I think, when he",1458.89,2.136
feels very passionately about something as much as,1461.026,2.135
the executive order.,1463.161,1.068
He was doing it to make sure Americans were safe.,1464.229,2.235
The order -- the U.S.,1466.464,1.302
code is crystal-clear on this.,1467.766,2.235
I think I&amp;#39;ve read it for like three days in a row.,1470.001,2.503
And it can&amp;#39;t be any clearer how much authority,1472.504,2.169
it gives the President to do what he can,1474.673,1.334
to keep us safe.,1476.007,1.001
He&amp;#39;s concerned that he&amp;#39;s doing what he can to keep,1477.008,2.069
"this country safe, and there has been a lot of",1479.077,2.369
activity to stand in the way.,1481.446,1.468
So I&amp;#39;m not sure how many more times I can read,1482.914,2.236
the code to you.,1485.15,0.967
"But 8 U.S. Code, 1182 --",1486.117,1.635
"The Press: Yes, but you and me talking about it is",1487.752,3.037
not how the judicial process works.,1490.789,1.334
Mr. Spicer: Thank you.,1492.123,0.668
You&amp;#39;ve asked the question now eight times.,1492.791,1.334
The Press: One more I&amp;#39;d like to ask you.,1494.125,1.368
One more about a different set of comments.,1495.493,1.335
Mr. Spicer: You&amp;#39;ve got -- hold on.,1496.828,1.335
I understand.,1498.163,0.667
"Thank you, go ahead.",1498.83,0.667
The Press: About a different set of comments,1499.497,1.335
"that have been made, Sean, also from Kellyanne Conway",1500.832,1.869
earlier this week.,1502.701,0.934
The Press: Let him go.,1503.635,1.335
Let him go.,1504.97,0.767
The Press: Earlier from this week.,1505.737,1.568
You say the -- this is in context of Nordstrom and,1507.305,2.87
"not about what she was counseled about, but about",1510.175,2.502
"something she said to CNN earlier this week, is that",1512.677,3.003
the President doesn&amp;#39;t comment on everything.,1515.68,1.869
And so I want to contrast the President&amp;#39;s repeated,1517.549,2.436
statements about Nordstrom with the lack of comments,1519.985,3.103
"about some other things, including, for example,",1523.088,2.736
the attack on a Quebec,1525.824,1.935
mosque and other similar environments.,1527.759,1.969
"Why is the President, when he chooses to --",1529.728,3.503
Mr. Spicer: Do you -- hold on -- because you just,1533.231,3.737
brought that up.,1536.968,0.668
I literally stand at this podium and opened a,1537.636,2.269
briefing a couple days ago about the President,1539.905,2.068
expressing his condolences.,1541.973,1.335
I literally opened the briefing about it.,1543.308,3.47
So for you to sit there and say --,1546.778,1.635
The Press: I was here.,1548.413,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I know.,1549.08,0.668
So why are you asking why he didn&amp;#39;t do it when I,1549.748,1.902
literally stood here and did it?,1551.65,1.334
The Press: The President&amp;#39;s statement --,1552.984,1.368
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t,1554.352,0.668
understand what you&amp;#39;re asking.,1555.02,0.667
The Press: Kellyanne&amp;#39;s comments were about that,1555.687,1.335
the President doesn&amp;#39;t have time to tweet about,1557.022,1.334
everything.,1558.356,0.668
Mr. Spicer: Right.,1559.024,0.667
The Press: He&amp;#39;s tweeting about this.,1559.691,1.335
Mr. Spicer: Right.,1561.026,0.667
The Press: He&amp;#39;s not,1561.693,0.701
tweeting about something else.,1562.394,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I came out here and actually spoke,1563.061,1.335
about it and said the President spoke --,1564.396,1.635
The Press: I&amp;#39;m talking,1566.031,0.7
about the President&amp;#39;s time.,1566.731,0.701
Mr. Spicer: What are you -- you&amp;#39;re equating me,1567.432,1.835
addressing the nation here and a tweet?,1569.267,3.103
I don&amp;#39;t -- that&amp;#39;s the silliest thing,1572.37,1.335
I&amp;#39;ve ever heard.,1573.705,0.734
The Press: I&amp;#39;m talking about an attack on,1574.439,2.703
Nordstrom on --,1577.142,0.834
"Mr. Spicer: Okay, I&amp;#39;m done.",1577.976,1.935
This is silly.,1579.911,0.667
"Okay, next.",1580.578,0.668
"The Press: -- and an attack on people, and",1581.246,1.368
you&amp;#39;re equating --,1582.614,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Thank you.,1583.281,0.668
You&amp;#39;ve asked your question.,1583.949,0.667
Thank you.,1584.616,0.667
The Press: Does that not diminish the language that,1585.283,1.335
you&amp;#39;re using?,1586.618,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Thank you.,1587.285,0.668
Go ahead.,1587.953,0.667
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",1588.62,0.667
One of the criticisms leveled at President,1589.287,1.368
"Trump&amp;#39;s predecessor, President Obama, by",1590.655,1.335
Republicans was his excessive use of,1591.99,1.368
executive orders.,1593.358,0.767
The President signed three,1594.125,1.168
more executive orders today.,1595.293,1.168
Why isn&amp;#39;t that criticism applicable to President,1596.461,2.035
Trump in the same manner,1598.496,1.469
that it was applicable to --,1599.965,1.735
Mr. Spicer: I think when you look at the context of,1601.7,2.235
"what they -- yes, what those executive orders",1603.935,2.469
"did, and there&amp;#39;s things that are within the bounds",1606.404,3.671
of trying to protect this country and ordering,1610.075,2.035
police officers -- nothing that I think even,1612.11,1.835
"Democrats would complain, with the exception of the",1613.945,2.703
one that we&amp;#39;ve had conversations on.,1616.648,1.702
Most of them have been widely praised by both,1618.35,3.67
"parties to keep this country safe, to get jobs",1622.02,2.703
creation back.,1624.723,1.001
Most of them have widely applauded.,1625.724,1.334
I think the difference with what President Obama,1627.058,1.802
did was stretch the executive order to take,1628.86,2.269
actions that had largely been within the realm of,1631.129,2.603
"Congress, and to do things that didn&amp;#39;t allow for",1633.732,2.902
prior input.,1636.634,1.302
The stuff that the President is doing is,1637.936,1.535
almost entirely highly applauded by both sides of,1639.471,4.971
the aisle and won tremendous praise.,1644.442,1.502
There&amp;#39;s a big difference in the context in which,1645.944,1.835
those two administrations operated.,1647.779,1.635
The Press: One of the criticisms in addition to,1649.414,2.402
that was that President Obama in using those EOs,1651.816,3.337
"was governing by executive fiat, he wasn&amp;#39;t working",1655.153,3.77
with Congress.,1658.923,0.668
Does the President plan to use --,1659.591,2.035
Mr. Spicer: Right.,1661.626,1.201
"But again, I think --",1662.827,0.668
The Press: -- Congress in a legislative manner?,1663.495,1.368
Mr. Spicer: Absolutely and I just mentioned both tax,1664.863,1.334
reform and repealing and,1666.197,0.668
replacing Obamacare -- immigration.,1666.865,1.334
There are so many areas where the President -- he,1668.199,1.836
literally just -- we held up this briefing a little,1670.035,3.403
so that eight United States senators could walk,1673.438,1.802
"out and talk about -- and again, that meeting, while",1675.24,2.536
"it was focused on the judiciary, they talked",1677.776,2.168
about infrastructure.,1679.944,0.768
They talked about other priorities that they have.,1680.712,2.769
He has shown a commitment to work across the aisle,1683.481,2.736
"to bring folks in, to listen, to hear their",1686.217,1.735
"thoughts, to get ideas on a legislative agenda that",1687.952,2.87
they can move together with.,1690.822,1.268
So I think there is a big difference between the,1692.09,2.736
last administration that sort of shunned Congress&amp;#39;s,1694.826,2.135
"role, and this administration where the",1696.961,2.002
President is actively seeking their input and,1698.963,1.936
"ideas, and helping them craft an agenda to move",1700.899,2.903
the country forward. Alexis.,1703.802,1.401
The Press: Can I follow up on the tax question?,1705.203,2.703
Mr. Spicer: Sure.,1707.906,0.934
The Press: Because there are revenue elements of,1708.84,2.536
"the Affordable Care Act, if it is repealed and",1711.376,2.836
replaced -- there has been discussion on the Hill,1714.212,2.87
about what would be the appropriate track to get,1717.082,2.836
that into tax legislation or how to treat that in,1719.918,3.17
tax legislation.,1723.088,0.667
If the President is interested in unveiling a,1723.755,2.502
tax package that is as comprehensive as you just,1726.257,2.87
"described, would the revenue elements of the",1729.127,2.202
Affordable Care Act be on a separate track?,1731.329,2.536
Or is he talking about folding them into one,1733.865,2.869
reconciliation package?,1736.734,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: So right now, as I mentioned at the",1737.402,3.003
"outset, I think we&amp;#39;re primarily looking at two",1740.405,2.269
reconciliation tracks --,1742.674,1.802
one utilizing the 2017 budget.,1744.476,3.67
So you could put your Obamacare repeal and,1748.146,2.069
"replace in the 2017 reconciliation package,",1750.215,3.303
and then you could potentially do tax reform,1753.518,2.669
-- comprehensive tax reform in the 2018 budget.,1756.187,3.938
"But I also want to say -- just so we&amp;#39;re clear, these",1760.125,3.303
aren&amp;#39;t prescriptive.,1763.428,0.734
I think we continue to work towards Congress on a,1764.162,3.704
range of options and ideas to accomplish both of,1767.866,2.135
those and other goals.,1770.001,1.435
Those seem primarily the two most opportune ways to,1771.436,3.637
get this thing done.,1775.073,1.168
But I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to rule in or anything out.,1776.241,1.868
I think both Speaker Ryan and Leader McConnell are,1778.109,2.503
going to weigh in on what best vehicles can be,1780.612,3.27
utilized to make this thing happen.,1783.882,1.635
So I don&amp;#39;t want to be prescriptive. Ben.,1785.517,1.868
The Press: You talked about the President&amp;#39;s tax,1787.385,3.07
reform plan in coming weeks.,1790.455,1.201
Is that something he&amp;#39;s talked about with leaders,1791.656,1.869
in both houses of Congress?,1793.525,1.167
And are they prepared for this?,1794.692,1.402
Mr. Spicer: Absolutely.,1796.094,0.7
"I mean, as I mentioned, he has met with, you know --",1796.794,2.97
just wrapped up a meeting with Republicans and,1799.764,2.87
Democratic senators.,1802.634,0.767
But this is something that the legislative affairs,1803.401,2.169
"team, as well as the President himself has",1805.57,3.003
engaged with members of Congress to talk about,1808.573,1.802
this both privately and in bigger groups.,1810.375,2.435
But there is a very large conversation going on to,1812.81,3.404
achieve bipartisan support,1816.214,1.368
for a package of this nature. Jonathan.,1817.582,1.868
The Press: Does the President believe that,1819.45,2.103
it&amp;#39;s possible to balance the budget without major,1821.553,2.936
entitlement reform?,1824.489,1.501
Any sort of House --,1825.99,0.801
Mr. Spicer: I think one of the things that the,1826.791,1.335
"President has looked at is not just the cutting side,",1828.126,4.805
but the revenue stream.,1832.931,0.834
One area in particular -- natural resources,1833.765,2.702
"regulation and tax reform, how we can grow the",1836.467,2.87
economy and bring in additional revenues to the,1839.337,2.202
government on the revenue side.,1841.539,2.002
So it&amp;#39;s -- there is a balance to how the,1843.541,1.735
President is looking at bringing down the deficit.,1845.276,2.469
And I think before I get -- he&amp;#39;s going to -- we&amp;#39;ll,1847.745,2.136
"have a budget out, you know, in a few weeks.",1849.881,2.536
I think that will answer a lot.,1852.417,1.268
"But again, I just -- when it comes to deficit",1853.685,2.669
"reduction, which is something that he is very",1856.354,3.07
"interested in, that is not",1859.424,2.102
a one-side-of-the-ledger option.,1861.526,1.435
That one -- a lot of what he is trying to talk about,1862.961,3.27
in these meetings and with business executives is how,1866.231,2.736
we can expand the economy.,1868.967,2.068
"And that expanded economy, that job creation, those",1871.035,3.971
explorations of natural resources and additional,1875.006,2.869
new jobs also bring additional tax revenue in.,1877.875,2.203
So there&amp;#39;s a way to do this.,1880.078,1.368
"If we start bringing businesses back, creating",1881.446,3.336
"more things, creating more jobs, that creates a",1884.782,2.403
revenue stream that has a significant impact on the,1887.185,3.503
deficit -- on being able to drive down the deficit,1890.688,3.037
and balancing the budget.,1893.725,0.934
So I think it&amp;#39;s not something I want to get in,1894.659,2.069
"too much detail now, but I will tell you that I think",1896.728,1.835
"the President has been very, very keen on trying",1898.563,2.302
to make sure that we look at the revenue side as,1900.865,2.069
much as we&amp;#39;re looking at the spending side.,1902.934,1.635
"When it comes to the spending side, again,",1904.569,2.202
