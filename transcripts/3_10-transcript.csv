"In just these first 50 days, the President has",30.964,3.57
taken many key steps towards delivering on the,34.534,2.202
pledges he made to the American people,36.736,1.468
as a candidate.,38.204,1.368
He has jumpstarted job creation not only because,39.572,2.069
"of his executive actions, but through the surge of",41.641,2.569
economic confidence and optimism that has been,44.21,2.203
inspired since his election.,46.413,2.235
President Trump knows exactly what businesses,48.648,1.702
"need to thrive and grow, therefore adding",50.35,2.335
well-paying and steady jobs to the market.,52.685,2.737

the unemployment rate ticked down to,68.501,2.102

"Notably, we also saw significant growth in the",72.539,2.135

and mining sectors.,76.876,1.769
The unemployment rate ticked down and labor,78.645,2.369
"force participation rate ticked up, showing that",81.014,3.17
even as more people are reentering the job market,84.184,2.802
due to the economic optimism that I spoke,86.986,1.936
"about, businesses are continuing to grow and",88.922,2.836
create new jobs.,91.758,1.635
The President looks forward to continuing his,93.393,1.768
work with the private sector to clear roadblocks,95.161,2.703
"to key infrastructure projects, withdraw from",97.864,2.636
job-killing trade deals like the Trans-Pacific,100.5,2.069
"Partnership, and slash the bureaucratic red tape that",102.569,3.27

American businesses.,108.107,1.502

people from coming into our country that,128.695,1.835
seek to do us harm.,130.53,1.568
As a result of the presidential memorandum,132.098,2.035
"that he signed on January 28th, the President has",134.133,2.47
"received a plan to defeat ISIS, designed by the",136.603,3.136
Secretary of Defense and the national,139.739,2.402
security team.,142.141,1.268
"Just as he has promised during the campaign, he",143.409,2.503
has made enforcing our nation&amp;#39;s immigration laws,145.912,2.803
"a top priority, signing executive orders that",148.715,2.969
"start work on a Southern border wall, that enhance",151.684,3.37
the public safety of Americans through ordering,155.054,2.636
the strong enforcement of immigration laws that are,157.69,2.269
"already on the books, halting funding to",159.959,2.436
jurisdictions in the United States that don&amp;#39;t,162.395,2.302
"comply with federal immigration rules, and",164.697,2.636

of Obamacare and replacing it with the American,195.528,2.836
Health Care Act.,198.364,1.502
And this particular legislation is just one,199.866,1.935
prong in the President&amp;#39;s comprehensive approach to,201.801,2.603
reforming our healthcare system.,204.404,1.968
The administration is also taking additional steps to,206.372,3.637
stabilize health insurance markets and start bringing,210.009,2.703
down costs for the millions of Americans that,212.712,2.035
"have been affected by Obamacare, such as",214.747,2.336
stabilizing insurance markets through regulatory,217.083,2.236
"reform, including the ability to purchase",219.319,2.402

restrictions on the financial structure of,230.029,1.936
plans offered through the Obamacare exchanges.,231.965,3.236
"And finally, the President is committed to working",235.201,1.769
with Congress on additional legislation,236.97,2.602
that won&amp;#39;t be subject to the budget reconciliation,239.572,2.202
"process, that will allow the purchase of health",241.774,2.57
insurance across state lines; that will,244.344,2.168
streamline the process of the FDA to bring down the,246.512,3.204
cost of critical medicine; to allow for the expansion,249.716,3.27
of health savings accounts to allow more Americans to,252.986,2.802
use their funds for more healthcare costs --,255.788,2.57
"healthcare-related costs, and so much more.",258.358,1.935
There&amp;#39;s a one-page factsheet that lays out,260.293,2.069

"And with that, I&amp;#39;d be glad to take your questions.",488.888,3.87
John Roberts.,492.758,0.668
"The Press: I was going to say,",493.426,1.635
your pin is upside down.,495.061,1.868
Mr. Spicer: John Roberts always helping with the,496.929,1.602
fashion tips.,498.531,0.667
(Laughter.) The Press: It&amp;#39;s still upside down.,499.198,1.335
"The Press: You wanted -- is that a distress call, Sean?",500.533,1.935
(Laughter.),502.468,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Appreciate that.,503.135,0.668
The Press: House of Cards promo.,503.803,1.334
"Mr. Spicer: Thank you, no.",505.137,0.668
There&amp;#39;s no promo.,505.805,1.301
(Laughter.),507.106,1.301
"John, now on to your questions.",508.407,1.168
(Laughter.),509.575,1.168
But thank you.,510.743,1.535
The Press: Our involvement of sending rangers and,512.278,1.668
Marines into Syria marks a dramatic change in our,513.946,4.705
"presence on the ground there, and I&amp;#39;m wondering,",518.651,1.668
how much autonomy is the President giving General,520.319,2.937
James Mattis to involve U.S.,523.256,1.801
forces on the ground in Syria?,525.057,2.269
Mr. Spicer: A U.S.,527.326,1.569
Marine artillery unit and a team of rangers have,528.895,2.002
recently positioned in Syria to provide a,530.897,3.003
"combined joint task force, Operation Inherent",533.9,2.569
"Resolve, the commander, the agility to expedite",536.469,3.47
the destruction of ISIS in Raqqa in particular.,539.939,3.003
The exact numbers and locations of the forces,542.942,2.602
are still a sensitive order to protect the,545.544,2.236
"location of the forces, but there will be",547.78,2.236
approximately an additional 400 enabling,550.016,2.168
forces deployed under existing authorities for a,552.184,2.803
temporary period to enable our Syrian partnered,554.987,3.27
"forces to accelerate the defeat of ISIS,",558.257,2.269
specifically in Raqqa.,560.526,1.168
"I think, as I&amp;#39;ve mentioned before, one of the things",561.694,3.203
that the President has ensured is that the,564.897,4.038
commanders have the flexibility to do what,568.935,3.169
they need to fulfill the mission.,572.104,3.237
"The President is obviously, as",575.341,2.736
"Commander-in-Chief, made aware and signs off on all",578.077,3.003
"of those missions, but at the end of the day, it&amp;#39;s",581.08,2.569
going to up to the generals to execute their,583.649,2.336
mission to make sure that we continue to defeat ISIS,585.985,3.203
and protect the nation.,589.188,0.768
The Press: Now our involvement there really,589.956,2.102
sort of complicates the whole picture because,592.058,2.135
"we&amp;#39;re aligned with the Kurds, but then at the",594.193,1.568
"same time, a NATO ally, Turkey, sees the",595.761,2.236
Kurds as the enemy.,597.997,1.335
And then there&amp;#39;s what happens with Russia and,599.332,2.035
its involvement with the Syrian government.,601.367,1.635
So the big problem with Iraq was we never planned,603.002,3.971
for the day after.,606.973,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Right.,607.64,0.667
The Press: So what are the plans for the day after,608.307,2.036
here when Raqqa falls?,610.343,1.201
Who occupies it?,611.544,1.168
"Mr. Spicer: Well, one of the things that I",612.712,2.602
mentioned in the script that is part of what the,615.314,2.67
President has done during his first 50 days is issue,617.984,3.236
an executive order on January 28th for the,621.22,2.803
Secretary of Defense to submit a comprehensive,624.023,3.003
plan in consultation with the joint chiefs and other,627.026,2.903
members of the national,629.929,0.7
security team to defeat ISIS.,630.629,1.802
That is part of that plan.,632.431,1.335
And so I think you are seeing a comprehensive,633.766,2.502
approach to not only how we&amp;#39;re going to engage in,636.268,2.303
"Syria, but the total defeat and",638.571,3.303
elimination of ISIS.,641.874,1.101
So that is part of an ongoing process that the,642.975,2.936
"Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint",645.911,1.635
"Chiefs, and others have been involved in, in",647.546,2.169
briefing the President.,649.715,0.801
The Press: But does the President have an idea of,650.516,3.737
who should occupy Raqqa?,654.253,0.667
Should it be Kurkish forces?,654.92,0.734
Should it be a coalition?,655.654,0.768
Should American forces stay there?,656.422,1.335
Mr. Spicer: I think that as we devolve that plan,657.757,1.935
I&amp;#39;ll have more for you on that.,659.692,1.535
I think you&amp;#39;ve already killed one-question,661.227,1.935
"Friday, but we&amp;#39;re going to get back to it.",663.162,2.369
"Jon Karl, one-question Friday.",665.531,1.535
"The Press: Okay, I&amp;#39;ll make it one.",667.066,2.135
"Sean, the chair and ranking member of the",669.201,1.869
House Intelligence Committee have asked the,671.07,2.002
Justice Department to turn over any information that,673.072,2.803
they have that there was any wiretapping of,675.875,4.437
"President-elect Trump, candidate Trump",680.312,1.469
at Trump Tower.,681.781,0.667
If there is no evidence that any wiretapping took,682.448,3.971
"place, will the President apologize to President",686.419,2.969
Obama for making such a serious charge?,689.388,1.902
Mr. Spicer: Let&amp;#39;s not get ahead of ourselves.,691.29,1.835
"I think it&amp;#39;s important to see where that goes, and I",693.125,3.404
don&amp;#39;t want to prejudge their work at this time. Jim.,696.529,3.403
The Press: But if there&amp;#39;s no,699.932,1.401
"evidence, I mean, what&amp;#39;s he --",701.333,1.235
"Mr. Spicer: But I think you&amp;#39;re asking,",702.568,1.335
"well, what if there&amp;#39;s evidence?",703.903,0.934
"I&amp;#39;m not going to get into a series of hypotheticals,",704.837,3.303
prejudging the outcome of a report or an,708.14,2.002
investigation that hasn&amp;#39;t occurred yet.,710.142,2.102
"I think once that&amp;#39;s done, we&amp;#39;ll respond",712.244,2.002
appropriately. Jim.,714.246,1.035
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",715.281,1.902
Senator Cory Gardner was reported by Politico,717.183,2.669
yesterday to have said he doesn&amp;#39;t believe that a,719.852,3.437
$14-billion wall along the Mexican border is the best,723.289,3.436
way to provide border security.,726.725,1.936
Does the White House see support for the border,728.661,3.437
wall weakening in Congress?,732.098,1.534
Mr. Spicer: No.,733.632,1.335
The President was very clear that was something,734.967,1.869
that he campaigned on and promised the American,736.836,2.202
people as an effort to both protect our national,739.038,2.069
"security and our economic security, and he&amp;#39;s going",741.107,3.67
to fulfill that pledge.,744.777,0.834
He&amp;#39;s already started to work with the Department,745.611,1.602
"of Homeland Security on both the plans, and the",747.213,2.235
funding mechanism and the bidding and the RFP,749.448,1.935
"process will roll out slowly -- or shortly,",751.383,3.003
I should say.,754.386,0.668
But that&amp;#39;s a pledge that he intends to maintain.,755.054,3.07
John Bennett.,758.124,0.667
"The Press: Sean, a lot of action on the Hill of",758.791,2.769
"course with healthcare lately, but April 28th is",761.56,2.736
"right around the corner, government funding expires.",764.296,1.836
Given that during the transition period you guys,766.132,3.336
asked for a short-term CR so you could weigh in once,769.468,4.638
"you were in office, what&amp;#39;s the White House doing",774.106,2.669
right now to avoid a shutdown?,776.775,2.136
"I talked to some sources, they couldn&amp;#39;t point to",778.911,2.703
specific talks.,781.614,0.667
So what&amp;#39;s the state of play there?,782.281,2.035
"Mr. Spicer: Well, Director Mulvaney is going to",784.316,2.069
release his budget on the 16th.,786.385,3.203
That&amp;#39;s the first step in working with them to get,789.588,2.636
the budget under control.,792.224,0.968
"We&amp;#39;re approaching $20 trillion of our debt, and",793.192,5.105
I think we need to get spending under control.,798.297,2.502
And so part of funding the government goes hand in,800.799,3.704
hand with keeping track of what we&amp;#39;re spending it on,804.503,3.07
"and how we&amp;#39;re spending it on, what our",807.573,1.335
priorities are.,808.908,0.667
We&amp;#39;ve begun that passback process that we talked,809.575,1.868
about internally within the executive branch.,811.443,2.803
Director Mulvaney has had several conversations with,814.246,1.969
"members on the Hill on both sides, and he&amp;#39;s going",816.215,2.402
to continue to have them.,818.617,0.701
I know the Vice President has been actively,819.318,2.436
engaged as well.,821.754,0.667
"But to your question, I mean, that&amp;#39;s part",822.421,1.902
of the process.,824.323,0.701
We need to release a budget first about what,825.024,1.968
"our priorities are for the coming fiscal year, and",826.992,2.937
then make sure that we do what we can going forward.,829.929,1.935
But this goes hand in hand with that.,831.864,2.169
"The Press: -- finish out the current fiscal year,",834.033,2.736
so does the --,836.769,0.767
Mr. Spicer: I understand.,837.536,0.801
"That&amp;#39;s fiscal year &amp;#39;17, but I think they go",838.337,2.236
hand in hand.,840.573,0.667
I think you need to close out FY17 and then I think,841.24,3.503
our budget lays out where we want to go in FY18.,844.743,2.87
"And I think once we have a handle on FY18, we can",847.613,3.103
start to backfill 2017.,850.716,3.303
"The Press: -- a specific ask, you want cuts",854.019,1.335
for the rest of &amp;#39;17?,855.354,0.968
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to -- I appreciate --,856.322,2.002
we&amp;#39;re not having that discussion here.,858.324,1.468
John Gizzi.,859.792,0.667
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",860.459,1.835
And I will honor the one-question Friday.,862.294,2.002
The President has said in the past the he welcomes,864.296,5.072
"compromise, and they&amp;#39;re open to compromise on the",869.368,4.137
immigration legislation that&amp;#39;s coming up.,873.505,2.536
This morning when she spoke at the Christian,876.041,4.071
"Science Monitor press breakfast, Minority Leader",880.112,3.07
Nancy Pelosi said that she would like to see the,883.182,5.072
comprehensive immigration package that passed the,888.254,3.036
"Senate but was stopped in the House brought back,",891.29,4.604
and that was her version,895.894,2.536
of a compromise on immigration.,898.43,2.536
What&amp;#39;s the administration&amp;#39;s position,900.966,2.036
on what former Speaker and Minority Leader --,903.002,3.003
Mr. Spicer: I think you&amp;#39;re referring the Gang of,906.005,1.368
"Eight bill, correct?",907.373,0.667
The Press: That&amp;#39;s correct.,908.04,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I think the President&amp;#39;s been very,908.707,1.735
clear during the campaign trail that that&amp;#39;s not a,910.442,1.735
bill that he supports.,912.177,3.137
But he looks forward to engaging with members to,915.314,2.436
find a way forward to fix our broken,917.75,1.835
immigration system.,919.585,1.001
That bill in particular I think is a nonstarter.,920.586,1.902
It was a nonstarter when it came out,922.488,1.334
the first time.,923.822,0.901
I think it continues to be a nonstarter.,924.723,1.502
But the President recognizes that the system,926.225,2.069
is broken and that he wants to work with,928.294,2.669
Congress to fix it. Hunter.,930.963,1.301
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",932.264,1.668
Does the White House believe there&amp;#39;s such a,933.932,1.569
thing as the deep state that&amp;#39;s actively working to,935.501,2.803
undermine the President?,938.304,1.034
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think that there&amp;#39;s no question",939.338,2.402
when you have eight years of one party in office,941.74,3.704
that there are people who stay in government who are,945.444,3.27
"affiliated with, joined, and continue to espouse",948.714,4.271
the agenda of the previous administration.,952.985,1.702
So I don&amp;#39;t think it should come as any surprise that,954.687,2.569
there are people that burrowed into government,957.256,3.27
"during eight years of the last administration, and",960.526,4.905
may have believed in that agenda and what to,965.431,2.369
continue to seek it.,967.8,0.634
I don&amp;#39;t think that should,968.434,0.6
come as a surprise to anyone.,969.034,0.868
The Press: And will the Director of the CIA or the,969.902,1.802
DNI have a presidential mandate to seek these,971.704,2.802
people out and fire them or purge them,974.506,1.569
from the government?,976.375,0.767
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s not part of the CIA&amp;#39;s mandate,977.476,2.102
"under any circumstances, so I don&amp;#39;t know on that. Blake.",979.945,3.637
"The Press: Sean, thanks.",984.717,0.867
The DNC just put out a statement a little while,986.018,1.568
ago saying it is President Obama who deserves the,987.886,2.403
credit for the February jobs numbers.,990.289,3.37
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sure they did.,993.659,1.101
"The Press: My question to you, how much do you feel",994.76,1.969
that President Trump should be credited for,996.729,2.068
"that, and how would you characterize the economy",998.797,2.336
that President Trump was handed over by,1001.133,2.336
President Obama?,1003.469,1.334
"Mr. Spicer: Look, numbers are going to",1004.803,1.235
go up and down.,1006.038,0.4
We recognize that.,1006.438,2.403
But I think there&amp;#39;s no question when you look at,1008.841,1.601
the CEOs that hire people and the CEOs that have,1010.442,3.37
talked about the investment that they want,1013.812,1.535
to make in America -- you can look back over the,1015.347,3.404
"last several administrations, I don&amp;#39;t",1018.751,1.601
believe I&amp;#39;ve ever seen the number of CEOs and,1020.352,3.237
businesses come out and talk about investments and,1023.589,3.27
continuing investments and the expansion of,1026.859,1.801
investments or hiring based on the vision and,1028.66,4.305
agenda of an administration the way,1032.965,1.568
they have in this one.,1034.533,1.134
And so it&amp;#39;s not just a question of,1035.667,1.469
what we believe.,1037.136,1.568
"I think if you look at the automakers, the other",1038.704,2.803
"manufacturers, and, frankly, some of the",1041.507,3.47
service industries that have come out and talked,1044.977,2.235
"about the investment that they&amp;#39;re going to make, or",1047.212,2.102
the continuation of a project that they had,1049.314,2.303
"going, or the movement of one -- of a manufacturing",1051.617,4.571
plant or job investment -- those speak,1056.188,3.036
for themselves.,1059.224,0.601
It&amp;#39;s not a question of what we believe.,1059.825,1.735
I think it&amp;#39;s a question of the commitment that U.S.,1061.56,1.969
manufacturers and job creators and businesses,1063.529,2.502
are making because they want to buy into the,1066.031,2.97
President&amp;#39;s agenda and vision for creating a more,1069.001,4.471
tax and regulatory business-friendly,1073.472,3.103
environment to grow here.,1076.575,1.368
And I think that those speak for themselves.,1077.943,3.37
"The Press: Do you believe, though, that he&amp;#39;s had --",1081.313,1.034
that the policies already,1082.347,1.168
have had an impact on them?,1083.515,1.068
Mr. Spicer: Absolutely.,1084.583,0.467
Look at the confidence indexes.,1085.05,2.636
They&amp;#39;re all going to the top.,1087.686,1.001
I think the stock market has generated over $3,1088.687,1.769
billion of additional wealth since,1090.456,2.268
he was elected.,1092.724,2.036
There are several economic indicators that show signs,1094.76,4.337
of strength because of the President&amp;#39;s,1099.097,1.802
vision and agenda.,1100.899,1.702
And I don&amp;#39;t think that that&amp;#39;s any secret.,1102.601,3.403
"I mean, when you talk to the economists, when you",1106.004,1.368
"talk to business leaders, they have confidence in",1107.372,2.536
the President&amp;#39;s agenda that it will yield for a,1109.908,2.469
more favorable business climate to hire more,1112.377,2.103
"Americans, to expand the manufacturing based in",1114.48,2.168
"America, to make us more competitive",1116.648,2.036
around the globe.,1118.684,1.868
And so I do believe that.,1120.552,1.902
But I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a question of what I believe,1122.454,2.102
or what the administration believes.,1124.556,1.201
I think if you look at what outside economists,1125.757,2.336
"and what business leaders do, they confirm that. Eamon.",1128.093,3.37
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1131.463,0.634
"In the past, the President has referred to particular",1132.097,2.069
job reports as &amp;quot;phony&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;totally fiction.&amp;quot; Does,1134.166,2.703
the President believe that this jobs report was,1136.869,1.768
accurate and a fair way to measure the economy?,1138.637,2.402
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, I talked to the President prior to",1141.039,1.535
"this, and he said to quote him very clearly -- &amp;quot;They",1142.574,2.536
"may have been phony in the past, but it&amp;#39;s very real now.&amp;quot;",1145.11,2.336
(Laughter.),1147.446,2.035
Sara.,1149.481,1.668
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1151.149,0.534
Could you clear up what appears to be some tension,1151.683,2.67
between what you said yesterday about when the,1154.353,3.737
administration or the President was made aware,1158.09,1.601
of General Flynn&amp;#39;s foreign lobbying ties and the AP,1159.691,2.336
reporting today that the transition team was,1162.027,3.003
informed of Flynn&amp;#39;s potential need,1165.03,2.135
to register?,1167.165,1.035
Mr. Spicer: So there&amp;#39;s a big difference between,1168.2,1.802
"when he filed, which was the other day -- two days",1170.002,2.335
ago -- and what happened then.,1172.337,2.469
"What the AP is reporting, just so we&amp;#39;re clear, is",1174.806,2.903
that a personal lawyer of General Flynn&amp;#39;s contacted,1177.709,2.97
a transition lawyer and asked for guidance on what,1180.679,2.636
he should or should not do.,1183.315,2.736
The lawyer was instructed that that wasn&amp;#39;t the role,1186.051,4.137
"of the transition, and that it was up to the",1190.188,0.801
personal lawyer to work with the appropriate,1190.989,2.369
authorities or subject matter experts to,1193.358,1.902
determine what was appropriate and what was,1195.26,2.569
not appropriate in terms of filing.,1197.829,1.469
But this was a personal matter.,1199.298,1.601
It&amp;#39;s a business matter.,1200.899,0.968
It&amp;#39;s not something that would be appropriate for a,1201.867,3.303
government entity to give someone guidance on when,1205.17,2.069
they should file as an individual --,1207.239,2.135
as a private citizen.,1209.374,1.502
"That was the guidance that was given, which is",1210.876,1.702
consistent with what should be done.,1212.578,2.369
And so I don&amp;#39;t think it should be a shock to,1214.947,2.035
anybody that if you asked a government lawyer what,1216.982,3.437
you should do in your private capacity as a,1220.419,1.768
"citizen, they&amp;#39;re going to tell you you should",1222.187,1.902
consult experts in that area to determine what you,1224.089,4.004
should or should not do.,1228.093,1.235
The Press: That advice was -- the transition was,1229.328,1.968
"aware of that advice, why wasn&amp;#39;t that then -- was",1231.296,2.036
the President made aware that that recommendation,1233.865,2.369
had been given to his national security advisor?,1236.234,1.569
"Mr. Spicer: Well, wait a minute, Sara.",1237.803,0.901
There are tons of individuals that consult,1238.704,2.369
"with the lawyers and with ethics experts and say, I",1241.073,5.171
"own this stock, will I have to sell it?",1246.244,1.902
I own a business.,1248.146,0.768
I own this house.,1248.914,1.134
"And for the most part, they&amp;#39;re given guidance as",1250.048,3.27
"to, hey, go seek professional help, consult",1253.318,2.202
"with this entity, consult with a lawyer.",1255.52,1.902
"It&amp;#39;s almost like asking someone for tax advice,",1257.422,2.536
calling -- and what you will -- if you call the,1259.958,2.302
"IRS and say, hey, I want to know what I should do",1262.26,2.136
"this, they will tell you to consult a tax attorney.",1264.396,2.936
"That&amp;#39;s not the job of a government official, is to",1267.332,2.469
tell you what you should or should not do in your,1269.801,2.269
capacity as a private citizen.,1272.07,2.036
And so that&amp;#39;s a vastly different scenario that,1274.106,4.104
any -- whether you -- regardless of what,1278.21,2.602
"department you call in government, if you call",1280.812,2.102
the Department of Education and ask them,1282.914,1.635
"about education standards, they&amp;#39;ll probably refer you",1284.549,2.103
to a local entity or to a teacher if you&amp;#39;re asking,1286.652,1.634
about your own child.,1288.286,1.469
That&amp;#39;s not why government officials -- they&amp;#39;re very,1289.755,2.335
clear about the line between private action and,1292.09,2.703
government action. Jordan.,1294.793,2.269
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1297.062,0.634
Does the President agree with House conservatives,1297.696,1.435
that the sunset date for the Medicaid expansion,1299.131,3.737
should be moved up to the end of next year?,1302.868,2.569
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think the bill that is before",1305.437,2.769
"the House right now, the reconciliation piece --",1308.206,1.902
"and again, I cannot reiterate it enough -- is",1310.108,2.469
part of a three-prong process.,1312.577,3.237
But the current process does several things.,1315.814,3.003
"Number one, it&amp;#39;s the first time that you&amp;#39;re going to",1318.817,1.969
have a full addressing of an entitlement like,1320.786,4.371
this in decades.,1325.157,2.135
"It is actually a very, very good thing for",1327.292,3.137
conservatives when you look at how we&amp;#39;re going to,1330.429,2.335
address Medicaid and an entitlement that many,1332.764,3.537
conservatives have fought for years need,1336.301,3.137
to be addressed.,1339.438,1.167
"But that being said, the President has also been",1340.605,1.068
very clear through all of the discussions -- and,1341.673,2.069
I&amp;#39;ve commented on that throughout the week --,1343.742,1.902
that as he meets with members of Congress and,1345.644,1.735
"outside groups, that if someone has got an idea",1347.379,2.202
that can make this legislation more,1349.581,4.071
"accessible, give more choice to the American",1353.652,1.635
"people, drive down costs, make it more",1355.287,2.436
"patient-centric, he wants to listen to it.",1357.723,2.268
But I think right now that&amp;#39;s where,1359.991,1.068
the bill stands.,1361.059,1.035
We&amp;#39;re going to continue to listen and work with,1362.094,1.501
members of the House,1363.595,0.901
and then eventually the Senate.,1364.496,1.768
And so I don&amp;#39;t want to prejudge where -- the,1366.264,1.969
process itself.,1368.233,1.902
But the bill was crafted in a way that I think,1370.135,2.202
represents the President&amp;#39;s thinking and in a -- very,1372.337,3.47
smart way of addressing,1375.807,2.87
entitlements and going forward.,1378.677,1.301
Francesca.,1379.978,0.801
"The Press: So just to put a pin in it, the President",1380.779,2.302
is willing to negotiate on the sunset of the,1383.081,2.736
expansion of Medicaid?,1385.817,1.168
Mr. Spicer: Right.,1386.985,1.034
Right now the date that&amp;#39;s in the bill is what the,1388.019,1.635
President supports.,1389.654,1.302
He is willing to listen to individuals on different,1390.956,2.235
aspects of the bill that might make it -- that,1393.191,4.204
might achieve the goals that he set out.,1397.395,1.402
But it&amp;#39;s not a question of negotiation.,1398.797,2.269
"We have a date in the bill, and that&amp;#39;s the",1401.066,1.334
date in the bill.,1402.4,2.103
But I think as the bill continues to work its way,1404.503,2.969
through the House -- and that goes for Speaker,1407.472,2.503
"Ryan, he&amp;#39;s got members that are approaching him",1409.975,2.402
with ideas and I&amp;#39;m sure he&amp;#39;s listening,1412.377,1.668
to them as well.,1414.045,1.469
Senator McConnell is probably dealing with the,1415.514,1.501
same issue in the Senate.,1417.015,1.335
And that&amp;#39;s the way that the process,1418.35,1.568
is going to work.,1419.918,0.534
And I&amp;#39;ve made it very clear since the get-go,1420.452,2.135
that this process is going to be one where we&amp;#39;re,1422.587,0.935
"going to take the best ideas, we&amp;#39;re going to",1423.522,2.235
listen to individuals and try to make sure that we,1425.757,2.569
achieve the goals that the President has laid out and,1428.326,2.403
the principles that he has laid out. Francesca.,1430.729,2.402
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",1433.131,1.068
"Piggybacking off John and John, at a breakfast this",1434.199,2.069
morning -- the same one he referenced -- Nancy Pelosi,1436.268,3.803
"also said, &amp;quot;It couldn&amp;#39;t possibly be true&amp;quot; of the",1440.071,2.803
President&amp;#39;s allegations against the former,1442.874,2.569
"President, &amp;quot;because that is not how our system",1445.443,2.203
works.&amp;quot; She also said &amp;quot;Obama would not do that&amp;quot;,1447.646,4.037
and &amp;quot;it would be a waste of time&amp;quot; for the House,1451.683,2.002
Intelligence Committee to investigate,1453.685,2.169
that allegation.,1455.854,1.268
Does the White House have any evidence to refute,1457.122,2.402
House Minority Leader and,1459.524,2.536
former Speaker Pelosi&amp;#39;s claim?,1462.06,3.337
And could you explain why the President hasn&amp;#39;t asked,1465.397,2.736
the FBI chief about this directly?,1468.133,2.469
Mr. Spicer: I think we spoke very clearly about,1470.602,2.102
what we&amp;#39;d like to happen last Sunday and I&amp;#39;m going,1472.704,2.469
to reiterate it: We believe that the House and,1475.173,1.935
Senate intelligence committee have the,1477.108,1.335
appropriate forum and process and staff to look,1478.443,2.636
into this matter and report back.,1481.079,2.503
"The Press: Sean, on Flynn.",1483.582,3.236
Can you say that the President was informed at,1486.818,2.369
all about this arrangement?,1489.187,1.669
"Mr. Spicer: No, he was not.",1490.856,1.634
The Press: The need to register as a,1492.49,0.801
foreign agent?,1493.291,1.569
The Press: And then did this set off any alarm,1494.86,2.502
bells with anyone?,1497.362,0.567
"Mr. Spicer: No, just so we&amp;#39;re clear, you wouldn&amp;#39;t",1497.929,2.236
-- General Flynn filed with the Department of,1500.165,2.235
Justice two days ago.,1502.4,1.669
"How would anyone know that he was going to -- I mean,",1504.069,1.535
that&amp;#39;s sort of like asking --,1505.604,0.767
The Press: What about the need to file?,1506.371,3.203
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s up to his personal lawyer.,1509.574,1.602
"I mean, again, each person that goes through the",1511.176,1.868
process in government seeks counsel in many,1513.044,2.803
cases regarding the assets they own and the,1515.847,1.969
activities they conducted as to what they have,1517.816,2.002
to do or not do.,1519.818,1.234
But this is something that -- it&amp;#39;s like asking,1521.052,2.303
whether someone needed to file -- if they had a,1523.355,2.636
"client, whether or not they have to file a",1525.991,1.334
lobbying disclosure form.,1527.325,2.036
That&amp;#39;s not up for us to determine.,1529.361,2.168
That&amp;#39;s up for them and their counsel to determine,1531.529,2.203
if they engaged in activities in the past or,1533.732,2.135
whatever it is.,1535.867,2.036
Or if a doctor needed to go and up their,1537.903,2.168
"certification, that is not up for the",1540.071,2.069
government to determine.,1542.14,1.235
There are certain private citizens&amp;#39; activities that,1543.375,2.435
"you conduct and you seek counsel on, or",1545.81,2.369
professional advice.,1548.179,1.368
That&amp;#39;s not up to the government.,1549.547,1.736
And that&amp;#39;s exactly how the system worked.,1551.283,1.668
The Press: But how did that not raise a red flag?,1552.951,1.068
"I mean, you have an attorney calling --",1554.352,0.935
"Mr. Spicer: You already got your question, John.",1555.654,0.7
We&amp;#39;re doing one-question Friday.,1556.688,1.902
The Press: But this is an important point.,1558.59,1.001
"Mr. Spicer: No, it&amp;#39;s not, John.",1559.591,0.534
The Press: Because you have an attorney calling,1560.425,1.435
the transition saying that the person who is in line,1561.86,2.769
to be the national security advisor may need,1564.629,3.037
to register as a foreign agent.,1567.666,1.768
And that doesn&amp;#39;t raise a red flag?,1569.434,1.535
"Mr. Spicer: No, it&amp;#39;s not a question of raising",1570.969,1.001
"a red flag, John.",1571.97,1.034
It&amp;#39;s a question of whether or not they gave them the,1573.004,2.036
"advice that they&amp;#39;re supposed to, which is, it",1575.04,1.801
is not up to them to make decisions as to what you,1576.841,3.07
need to do or not do.,1579.911,1.268
"As you know, there are certain activities that",1581.179,1.869
fall under each of these requirements as far as,1583.048,2.569
"what the threshold is, what activities, who the",1585.617,1.968
"funding source was, et cetera, et cetera.",1587.585,2.269
"It is not up to -- nor is it appropriate, nor is it",1589.854,3.37
legal -- for the government to start going,1593.224,2.069
"into private citizens, seeking advice and telling",1595.293,2.403
them what they have to register or not.,1597.696,2.168
That would be the equivalent of walking,1599.864,1.202
through someone&amp;#39;s tax return and saying that&amp;#39;s,1601.066,1.334
"not a deduction that you should take, that is.",1602.4,1.468
"That&amp;#39;s why, when you contact these agencies,",1603.868,2.236
"they will tell you, you should seek counsel or",1606.104,2.803
professional advice or expertise in whatever,1608.907,2.069
matter it is.,1610.976,1.067
"That is not up to them to determine,",1612.043,2.436
plain and simple. Glenn.,1614.479,2.936
"I called on Glenn -- John, we&amp;#39;re going --",1617.415,1.735
The Press: Moving beyond the legal question here.,1619.15,1.635
Mr. Spicer: Thank you.,1620.785,0.534
"The Press: Just to follow up with John, moving",1621.319,2.102
"beyond the legal question here, this is an issue of",1623.421,2.97
judgment about who you guys wanted here in,1626.391,1.702
your administration.,1628.093,1.968
There were published reports that your,1630.061,1.669
potential national security advisor had,1631.73,2.535
"dealings with the government of Turkey, a",1634.265,1.869
controversial regime at this moment in time.,1636.134,2.336
Congressman Cummings sent a letter to Mike Pence,1638.47,4.437
during the transition informing him of this and,1642.907,2.503
raising a red flag.,1645.41,1.635
"Mr. Pence was on television, I believe",1647.045,1.735
"yesterday, saying twice that he had no knowledge",1648.78,2.302
of that letter.,1651.082,1.001
"Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s right -- no, no, that&amp;#39;s not --",1652.083,0.968
"hold on, it stop there.",1653.051,1.568
"No, no, hold on, before you accuse the Vice",1654.619,2.403
President of certain things --,1657.022,0.767
The Press: Yeah.,1657.789,0.434
"Mr. Spicer: Now, what he said was that he was not",1658.223,2.102
"aware of the filing, just so we&amp;#39;re clear.",1660.325,1.501
And he wasn&amp;#39;t.,1661.826,0.501
Thank you.,1662.327,0.801
Go on.,1663.128,0.634
The Press: But just in terms of the larger,1663.762,0.734
question here.,1664.496,1.001
Forget about filling out forms and the,1665.497,1.635
legalisms here.,1667.132,1.001
What does this say about the transition team&amp;#39;s,1668.133,3.904
judgment about still appointing him as national,1672.037,4.07
security advisor when you had knowledge of,1676.107,1.268
this information?,1677.375,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: No, but you&amp;#39;re asking me -- forget",1678.043,2.102
about the legalisms.,1680.145,1.234
"That&amp;#39;s what we ask people to do, is follow the law.",1681.379,3.237
You can&amp;#39;t forget about the legalisms.,1684.616,2.002
"The Press: No, no.",1686.618,0.534
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, that&amp;#39;s what you said.",1687.152,1.468
"And what I&amp;#39;m saying is, that&amp;#39;s what we did.",1688.62,2.502
"They consulted a lawyer, which everyone who had",1691.122,3.103
something of -- is advised to do.,1694.225,1.969
"That lawyer consulted the transition lawyer, who",1696.194,2.269
"said, it is your job to consult the",1698.463,1.535
appropriate lawyers.,1699.998,1.768
"The Press: I&amp;#39;m moving beyond the legal issues,",1701.766,2.336
I&amp;#39;m saying in terms of -- we&amp;#39;re moving beyond the,1704.102,1.702
issue of the papers here.,1705.804,2.702
We&amp;#39;re talking about the judgment that the,1708.506,1.602
"President, the Vice President and your team",1710.108,3.804
made to select this man as national security advisor,1713.912,2.769
when you had information that he had these,1716.681,1.568
dealings with Turkey.,1718.249,1.335
Why did you guys still make that decision?,1719.584,1.068
Mr. Spicer: But it&amp;#39;s a question -- what dealings,1720.652,1.034
are you referring to?,1721.686,0.868
The fact that he had a client -- he was also the,1722.554,2.135
head of the department of -- the Defense,1724.689,2.703
"Intelligence Agency, unbelievably qualified, 40",1727.392,2.569
years in the military with impeccable credentials.,1729.961,2.836
"I mean, so what is it?",1732.797,1.235
That he -- what exactly are you getting at?,1734.032,2.903
"Because so far, he has impeccable credentials, he",1736.935,2.435
"had a stellar career in the military, widely",1739.37,2.303
"respected, and I think for you to start to",1741.673,2.736
impugn his integrity --,1744.409,1.702
"The Press: No, but Vice President Pence",1746.111,0.934
said that yesterday -- that he wouldn&amp;#39;t have that --,1747.045,1.902
"Mr. Spicer: But again, but there was no disclosure at the time.",1748.947,3.27
"And the question is, is that if his counsel worked",1752.217,2.369
with whomever he worked with and determined that,1754.586,1.601
"he didn&amp;#39;t, that&amp;#39;s up to him.",1756.187,1.669
But it was up to him.,1757.856,1.167
The burden is on the individual to seek the,1759.023,1.602
legal advice or professional expertise to,1760.625,2.703
decide what they have to file and not.,1763.328,2.969
"I mean, we could literally have a hypothetical",1766.297,1.001
question about somebody who made an inappropriate,1767.298,2.169
filing on their tax returns or another -- or a,1769.467,2.803
professional qualification.,1772.27,3.337
At the end of the day when people present it with,1775.607,1.568
"you, they are advised to seek expertise and counsel",1777.175,3.87
and legal advice about what&amp;#39;s appropriate,1781.045,1.635
and what&amp;#39;s not.,1782.68,0.868
That is not -- it is not up to the transition,1783.548,1.935
attorney to go through someone&amp;#39;s livelihood and,1785.483,2.469
determine what they need to see.,1787.952,1.869
"They were given the proper legal advice at the time,",1789.821,2.035
which was to seek expertise in that matter.,1791.856,1.935
"He had already obtained counsel, and that&amp;#39;s --",1793.791,1.869
The Press: Let me just sort of clarify.,1795.66,3.203
The transition officials were not overly concerned,1798.863,2.403
by his relationship with the government of Turkey?,1801.266,1.434
Mr. Spicer: It&amp;#39;s not a question of overly,1802.7,0.701
"concerned, Glenn.",1803.401,0.567
"The question is, did they provide him the avenue",1803.968,2.136
"that they were supposed to, which is, did they",1806.104,1.802
"tell him to seek counsel, and they did.",1807.906,2.969
And that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s supposed to happen.,1810.875,1.802
"That&amp;#39;s it, plain and simple. Yes.",1812.677,1.869
"The Press: Sean, I guess the question for you very",1814.546,2.035
"simply would be then right now, does this raise",1816.581,1.602
concerns that there may be other members of this,1818.183,1.801
administration or other members that served in the,1819.984,1.902
transition that were or are currently lobbying on,1821.886,2.903
behalf of foreign governments right now that,1824.789,2.035
may be advising the President of the,1826.824,1.435
United States?,1828.259,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: Look, I think we trust people to fill",1828.927,2.435
"out the appropriate forms that they need to,",1831.362,2.236
and in this case --,1833.598,1.068
The Press: But that&amp;#39;s what betrayed --,1834.666,1.167
Mr. Spicer: -- and the President acted,1835.833,1.135
"accordingly back in the thing, and he made the",1836.968,1.368
right call then.,1838.336,1.134
"The Press: He may have been taking actions,",1839.47,1.235
"though, he may have made the right call -- the",1840.705,1.502
national security advisor.,1842.207,1.434
Mr. Spicer: But you&amp;#39;re asking me -- this is --,1843.641,2.536
"look, this is like saying -- can you tell me that",1846.177,3.103
the executives at NBC News have gone through every,1849.28,1.735
single person&amp;#39;s and reporters background --,1851.015,1.368
The Press: They&amp;#39;re not the President of,1852.383,1.035
the United States.,1853.418,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, I understand that.",1854.085,0.834
But we trust people to fill out the forms that,1854.919,1.502
they&amp;#39;re required to do so in an honest,1856.421,1.434
and legal manner.,1857.855,1.902
"And in this case, he retroactively filed the",1859.757,2.236
"forms that he was supposed to do, but we advised him",1861.993,2.402
"to do what the legal and proper thing was, and",1864.395,2.369
that&amp;#39;s the right thing for this administration.,1866.764,1.836
"So we did the right thing then, and we expect every",1868.6,2.736
employee to follow the law.,1871.336,1.935
"This President, when it comes to ethics and when",1873.271,2.002
"it comes to lobbying, he instituted a five-year",1875.273,2.035
"ban, he banned people -- he has ran on a commitment",1877.308,2.236
to drain the swamp.,1879.544,1.802
He has been very committed to making sure that we,1881.346,2.402
institute high standards here and that,1883.748,2.202
we&amp;#39;re held to them.,1885.95,0.834
"And so at the end of the day, when he found out",1886.784,2.403
that General Flynn had betrayed the trust of the,1889.187,2.569
"Vice President back in the day, he let him go.",1891.756,2.803
The President has high standards for everyone,1894.559,2.369
that works in this administration.,1896.928,1.668
"So the answer to your question is, if somebody",1898.596,1.535
does something that is not in keeping with the,1900.131,2.202
President&amp;#39;s standards that he&amp;#39;s set for every single,1902.333,1.735
person in the administration,1904.068,1.769
they will be let go.,1905.837,1.134
The Press: So do you have full faith in all those,1906.971,1.068
people that are advising the President right now?,1908.039,1.902
Mr. Spicer: I believe that everybody has done what,1909.941,2.035
"has legally been required of them, but I can&amp;#39;t tell",1911.976,1.769
you that every single,1913.745,1.635
person has done everything.,1915.38,1.501
I can tell you the President has made clear,1916.881,2.77
to every person in this administration you are,1919.651,1.601
expected to live up to the high standards that he has,1921.252,2.269
"set for them, and that if you don&amp;#39;t you",1923.521,1.835
will be dismissed.,1925.356,1.735
"The Press: Sean, the removal of South Korea&amp;#39;s",1927.091,2.369
"President, what&amp;#39;s the reaction of the",1929.46,0.1
White House to it?,1929.56,5.84
"And also, we know that there will be a",1935.4,4.137
"presidential election very soon in South Korea, and",1939.537,4.738
we know several leading candidates.,1944.275,3.303
They prefer -- last confrontation was DPRK and,1947.578,3.471
also opposed the deployment of a,1951.049,2.269
THAAD system.,1953.318,2.235
So does the White House looking to the impact of,1955.553,4.171
the election might bring?,1959.724,3.103
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I believe they have to have",1962.827,1.735
an election within 60 days.,1964.562,1.568
There&amp;#39;s an acting President who we have,1966.13,3.404
"strong relationships with, and we will continue to",1969.534,2.803
work with South Korea.,1972.337,1.134
They are both an ally and a friend in the region.,1973.471,2.069
This is obviously an issue that we continue to keep,1975.54,2.836
up with on the developments there.,1978.376,2.069
It&amp;#39;s a domestic issue in which the United States,1980.445,2.102
takes no position in the outcome of that election.,1982.547,2.636
It&amp;#39;s up to the Korean people and their,1985.183,2.169
democratic institutions to determine the future of,1987.352,3.169
their country.,1990.521,1.602
The United States continues to be a,1992.123,1.435
"steadfast ally, friend and partner to the",1993.558,2.235
Republic of Korea.,1995.793,0.534
And that&amp;#39;s it.,1996.327,4.038
"The Press: Obviously, you guys were excited about",2000.365,3.103
"the jobs report but maybe a little too excited, both",2003.468,3.503
you and the President tweeting within an hour of,2006.971,5.372
"the jobs data coming out, which is a violation of",2012.343,1.835
the federal rule.,2014.178,2.303

counseling in you and the President&amp;#39;s future?,2019.183,3.304
But also what you&amp;#39;d say generally to critics who,2022.487,1.635
"say, the risk of doing this is politicizing what",2024.122,2.636
should be kind of nonpartisan --,2026.758,2.202
Mr. Spicer: What I understand is that that rule was instituted,2028.96,3.069
to deal with market fluctuations.,2032.029,2.703
"I could be wrong, but I believe that&amp;#39;s why",2034.732,1.168
it was instituted.,2035.9,1.034
I think tweeting out &amp;quot;Great way to start a,2036.934,1.836
"Friday,&amp;quot; here are the actual numbers that you",2038.77,2.202
"all have reported, is a bit -- I mean, don&amp;#39;t make",2040.972,4.004
me make the podium move.,2044.976,1.168
(Laughter.),2046.144,3.57
"I mean, honest to god, like, every reporter",2049.714,3.036
"here reported out that we had 235,000 jobs,",2052.75,4.972
4.7 -- there isn&amp;#39;t a TV station that didn&amp;#39;t,2057.722,2.569
go live to it.,2060.291,0.901
"So to tweet out &amp;quot;Great way to start a Friday,&amp;quot; I",2061.192,2.703
"think, yes, the President was excited to see more",2063.895,1.968
Americans back to work.,2065.863,2.303
I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s exactly a market disruption.,2068.166,3.003
I think that there&amp;#39;s a lot of excitement in this,2071.169,1.568
country when we look at the policies that the,2072.737,2.803
President has instituted to help put more,2075.54,4.204
Americans back to work.,2079.744,0.801
"So I mean, I understand the rule, but let&amp;#39;s --",2080.545,3.737
"The Press: The Obama White House, for instance, went",2084.282,3.336
out of their way not to comment in,2087.618,1.569
that hour-long period.,2089.187,1.234
They would rearrange the President&amp;#39;s,2090.421,0.901
schedule around it.,2091.322,1.068
It was something that they and previous --,2092.39,1.201
Mr. Spicer: I get it.,2093.591,0.868
And I think there&amp;#39;s a difference --,2094.459,0.934
"The Press: -- going forward, yeah.",2095.393,1.168
Mr. Spicer: It&amp;#39;s not about commenting.,2096.561,1.234
I think it&amp;#39;s one thing to give analysis and,2097.795,2.269
whatever; literally tweeting out great news.,2100.064,1.535
"I think, yes, we are excited that when the",2101.599,2.836
President and the rest of the team saw the news this,2104.435,4.938
"morning, as reported on every television station,",2109.373,3.104
"Twitter, the Internet and every major news site in",2112.477,4.671
the country and around the world -- we were excited,2117.148,1.134
to see so many Americans back to work.,2118.282,2.636
So I apologize if we were a little excited.,2120.918,2.636
And we&amp;#39;re so glad to see so many fellow Americans,2123.554,1.635
back to work.,2125.189,1.268
But that&amp;#39;s -- Ashley.,2126.457,2.269
"The Press: Sean, Congressman Cummings&amp;#39;",2128.726,1.101
letter to the Vice President in November did,2129.827,1.568
lay out that General Flynn was being paid to lobby,2131.395,2.703
for Turkish interests during the campaign.,2134.098,3.37
Why did that not raise a red flag to the,2137.468,1.835
Vice President?,2139.303,0.601
Mr. Spicer: It&amp;#39;s not a question of raising a flag.,2139.904,1.101
Remember -- I think we keep forgetting something,2141.005,2.169
-- his attorney then went to a transition attorney,2143.174,3.403
"who was told, you need to seek counsel on this and",2146.577,2.77
get further guidance.,2149.347,0.7
That&amp;#39;s the job.,2150.047,0.901
"It&amp;#39;s not a question of &amp;quot;raise flags,&amp;quot; it&amp;#39;s not",2150.948,1.268
for us to adjudicate whether or not someone,2152.216,3.17
"needs to file under the Lobbying Disclosure Act,",2155.386,2.736
the FARA Registration Act.,2158.122,1.668
That&amp;#39;s not the job of a transition attorney.,2159.79,2.737
"It&amp;#39;s to tell them to seek additional counsel, or to",2162.527,4.104
"explain to them where to find that information, not",2166.631,2.068
to tell them what to do or not to do.,2168.699,2.002
The Press: But I&amp;#39;m asking about Vice President,2170.701,1.168
specifically -- not saying you should go to this,2171.869,2.603
"attorney or giving legal advice, but why, when this",2174.472,2.135
information was brought to the Vice President&amp;#39;s,2176.607,2.002
"attention, didn&amp;#39;t he raise questions, bring it to the",2178.609,3.304
"President, look into it further?",2181.913,1.935
Mr. Spicer: Because I think it&amp;#39;s fairly simple,2183.848,2.035
to say why didn&amp;#39;t this occur.,2185.883,1.502
We&amp;#39;re going through several people.,2187.385,1.368
"The answer is, did they seek the appropriate",2188.753,1.401
"professional advice and counsel, and they did.",2190.154,2.035
And that&amp;#39;s the answer. Alexis.,2192.189,2.303
The Press: I have a healthcare question for you.,2194.492,1.601
"Mr. Spicer: Oh, good.",2196.093,0.401
(Laughter.),2196.494,2.002
The Press: Aren&amp;#39;t you relieved.,2198.496,1.968
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s the appeal about it.,2200.464,2.77
The Press: Would the President be willing to,2203.234,1.501
sign legislation -- is he flexible about the,2204.735,0.901
refundable tax credit portion of the House bill?,2205.636,1.135
Would he be willing to sign legislation that,2206.771,5.005
avoided that particular provision?,2211.776,1.935
"Because, as you know, conservatives are",2213.711,1.435
concerned that that&amp;#39;s an additional entitlement.,2215.146,2.436
"Mr. Spicer: I think that, more and more, as the",2217.582,1.534
President talks to members of Congress and outside,2219.116,3.838
"groups -- number one, I think they&amp;#39;re excited to",2222.954,2.302
"understand the totality of this, and I think he",2225.256,1.134
addresses this in the weekly address that you,2226.39,2.303
"can at whitehouse.gov, that continues to explain",2228.693,5.839
the comprehensive aspect of this.,2234.532,1.568
"Our reconciliation piece, the administrative piece",2236.1,3.303
"that Secretary Price will institute, and then the",2239.403,2.57
additional legislation -- buying healthcare across,2241.973,3.837
"state lines, allowing small businesses to pool",2245.81,1.835
"their things, allowing health savings accounts to",2247.645,3.837
"expand, the streamlining of the FDA, going after",2251.482,4.571
medical malpractice -- all those things,2256.053,1.902
that bring costs down.,2257.955,1.201
"But as I&amp;#39;ve noted before, I mean, people have to",2259.156,2.136
remember that if you get your healthcare through,2261.292,2.235
"your employer, which the majority of Americans do,",2263.527,3.27
"you are not taxed on that, your employer",2266.797,2.036
is not taxed on it.,2268.833,1.101
It is fairly inadequate and unbalanced for small,2269.934,3.503
"business owners, ranchers and farmers, sole",2273.437,3.537
proprietors to have to face a disproportionate,2276.974,2.97
tax burden because they&amp;#39;re not a big employer.,2279.944,3.036
I think this is something that conservatives should,2282.98,6.14
"be embracing, and I think the more that they",2289.12,0.667
understand the comprehensive nature of,2289.787,1.335
"this, they are beginning to support more --",2291.122,1.401
"The Press: So the President wants it to stay, the",2292.523,3.27
refundable tax credit provisions?,2295.793,1.602
"Mr. Spicer: Oh, absolutely.",2297.395,0.9
The Press: Okay.,2298.295,1.168
The Press: Yes -- House Republicans that wrote a,2299.463,4.138
letter to the White House asking about why IRS,2303.601,4.171
Commissioner John Koskinen is still in his job.,2307.772,3.937
Do you have any response to that?,2311.709,1.868
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t.,2313.577,0.534
I&amp;#39;d refer you to the Department of,2314.111,0.634
Treasury on that. Yeah.,2314.745,0.834
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",2315.579,2.136
"The other day, the President tweeted that,",2317.715,1.601
"for the past eight years, during the Obama",2319.316,2.737
"presidency, Russia &amp;quot;ran over&amp;quot; the United States",2322.053,4.971
"and, in particular, picked off Crimea and added",2327.024,3.404
"missiles, which the President described in his",2330.428,2.802
tweet as &amp;quot;Weak!&amp;quot;,2333.23,3.07
"Given that he seems to be focused on Crimea, at",2336.3,3.504
"least as far as the tweet is concerned, will the",2339.804,2.168
President use the authority and funding,2341.972,2.336
granted him in the NDAA to send lethal defensive,2344.308,4.338
"weapons to Ukraine, as has been called for by the",2348.646,2.302
House and Senate Armed Services Committee,2350.948,2.536
"chairmans, and was in was in both party platforms,",2353.484,2.502
although the Republican language was watered down?,2355.986,2.57
And if he&amp;#39;s not going to -- I did ask you this,2358.556,2.002
about several weeks ago when Senator McCain sent a,2360.558,2.502
letter asking for this -- if the President doesn&amp;#39;t,2363.06,2.102
"want to do it, is that because he would rather",2365.162,3.203
focus his efforts with Russia on partnering to,2368.365,2.937
try to defeat ISIS?,2371.302,2.636
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think Ambassador Haley",2373.938,1.468
has noted at the U.N.,2375.406,1.034
that any attempt to undermine sanctions that,2376.44,3.07
currently exist because of the annexation of Crimea,2379.51,3.503
will remain in place until that issue is resolved.,2383.013,3.337
"I&amp;#39;m not going to -- the President, when it comes",2386.35,2.202
"to his overall negotiating strategy, has made it very",2388.552,2.703
clear in a variety of circumstances that his,2391.255,2.269
"philosophy is not one that says, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going to tell",2393.524,2.102
you what I&amp;#39;m going to do.&amp;quot;,2395.626,1.101
He holds his cards close to his vest to maximize,2396.727,2.336
his negotiating strategy.,2399.063,1.535
The Press: But why does sending weapons to Ukraine,2400.598,1.234
have anything to do with sanctions?,2401.832,1.035
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to get into the,2402.867,2.769
President&amp;#39;s negotiating strategy.,2405.636,1.435
"I will tell you that, as he continues to engage with",2407.071,3.27
the President of Russia and Secretary Tillerson --,2410.341,2.569
The Press: (Inaudible.),2412.91,1.635
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not.,2414.545,1.101
"We&amp;#39;re not -- Ryan, it&amp;#39;s your birthday.",2415.646,1.268
You get a question.,2416.914,0.868
"The Press: Going back to -- my staff, we&amp;#39;ve got",2417.782,3.47
about several dozen emails on -- we talked to,2421.252,2.836
congressmen this morning who were getting these,2424.088,1.401
"emails saying, if you&amp;#39;re going to repeal and",2425.489,1.669
"replace Obamacare, why not give everybody what",2427.158,2.702
Congress and Senators get?,2429.86,1.936
"Can you address that, since Congress won&amp;#39;t?",2431.796,1.001
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think part of what we&amp;#39;re trying",2432.797,2.202
"to do, we -- someone asked the other day",2434.999,2.402
about federal benefits.,2437.401,1.502
"Right now, a third of the counties around our",2438.903,2.402
country have one provider.,2441.305,2.336
That&amp;#39;s not choice.,2443.641,1.635
I think the President understands that very,2445.276,1.801
"clearly, and that&amp;#39;s, frankly, why he&amp;#39;s pushing",2447.077,2.103
"the American healthcare -- you know, why we&amp;#39;re doing",2449.18,2.435
"this, is that so many Americans have no choice,",2451.615,2.736
and that he wants there to be greater choice,2454.351,3.471
and lower costs.,2457.822,0.633
"By doing the stuff that we&amp;#39;re doing, especially",2458.455,2.47
the third prong of this -- allowing competition over,2460.925,2.736
"state lines, taking the government mandates away",2463.661,2.235
from what they have to include -- that&amp;#39;s really,2465.896,2.036
going to institute more choice.,2467.932,1.835
There will be more options.,2469.767,1.268
"If you remember, prior to Obamacare, you could go",2471.035,2.402
out on the open market and go from a variety of,2473.437,2.002
different options and tailor what you or your,2475.439,3.137
family needed based on the conditions that you sought,2478.576,2.369
or the deductible that you wanted.,2480.945,2.636
And choice dried up with Obamacare.,2483.581,1.801
"I think that&amp;#39;s the point, though, is that if you",2485.382,3.07
"want more of that kind of a system, then this is the",2488.452,3.003
bill and the legislation and the comprehensive,2491.455,2.669
approach that you should be supporting.,2494.124,2.069
"The Press: But specifically, the",2496.193,1.301
perception that somehow senators and congressmen,2497.494,4.338
get better care than the rest of us.,2501.832,2.302
Can you address that?,2504.134,1.769
"Mr. Spicer: Well, that&amp;#39;s what I -- yes, I think",2505.903,1.935
that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re trying to pass it the way we are.,2507.838,2.102
We want more choice.,2509.94,1.735
We want more competition.,2511.675,1.235
We want lower costs.,2512.91,0.934
The American people deserve a better,2513.844,2.936
"healthcare system, and that&amp;#39;s what this",2516.78,0.801
President is pushing for. Margaret.,2517.581,1.035
"The Press: Sean, did the White House sign off on",2518.616,2.202
Secretary Tillerson&amp;#39;s decision not to take the,2520.818,2.035
press with him on what should be an important,2522.853,1.635
"trip to Asia, and the",2524.488,1.769
growing North Korean threat?,2526.257,2.402
And what are his marching orders?,2528.659,2.869
You talked a lot about the flexibility the President,2531.528,1.635
has given to his generals.,2533.163,1.068
What flexibility has he given for diplomatic,2534.231,2.503
initiatives to his Secretary of State?,2536.734,1.968
"Mr. Spicer: As I mentioned at the beginning, the",2538.702,1.368
President is having lunch with Secretary Tillerson.,2540.07,1.602
I know that the trip was one of the topics of,2541.672,2.636
"discussion, and so I will try to follow",2544.308,3.203
up with that.,2547.511,0.567
And with respect to the first part of the,2548.078,1.101
"question, press is being invited to that trip.",2549.179,2.737
They&amp;#39;re traveling commercially.,2551.916,0.5
There is a press logistics component to make sure,2552.416,4.271
"that they can get everywhere, that they&amp;#39;re",2556.687,1.435
given access to everything.,2558.122,0.867
There&amp;#39;s a press conference --,2558.989,1.068
The Press: You can possibly to go to all three of those cities,2560.057,1.768
commercially to cover him in the way that --,2561.825,1.402
Mr. Spicer: The plane that the Secretary is taking,2563.227,2.769
"doesn&amp;#39;t accommodate that, but they have made",2565.996,2.269
accommodations for members of the press to,2568.265,2.169
cover everything.,2570.434,1.335
And I know that --,2571.769,0.867
The Press: Is that something you advised to him?,2572.636,0.734
"Mr. Spicer: No, we don&amp;#39;t get involved in the",2573.37,1.402
logistics for every Cabinet member&amp;#39;s trip.,2574.772,3.003
I would advise you to touch base with the,2577.775,1.701
"Secretary, with the State Department on this.",2579.476,2.069
But I know that they have made aware of the concerns,2581.545,2.503
"of some of your colleagues, and they are",2584.048,2.035
making accommodations in the future with respect to,2586.083,1.835
the size of the plane.,2587.918,1.535
"But make no mistake about it, there is a logistics",2589.453,2.903
component to make sure that the press is welcome,2592.356,1.768
"throughout the trip and at every stop, and that",2594.124,3.07
"accommodations are taken care of, and there&amp;#39;s",2597.194,1.635
logistical support to do that.,2598.829,2.269
There will be a press conference component as well.,2601.098,4.705
"The Press: Would you like, though, public diplomacy",2605.803,0.534
and this kind of important diplomatic initiative for,2606.337,1.234
this administration to be covered,2607.571,1.502
fully going forward?,2609.073,0.901
Mr. Spicer: I think it will.,2609.974,0.5
I hope it will be covered fully.,2610.474,0.868
The Press: And should they be -- reporters allowed to,2611.342,1.468
"be on the place with the Secretary, as they",2612.81,1.301
have for many years?,2614.111,1.168

sure that we carve out X number of seats and making,2620.05,1.802

blocking anybody.,2635.599,2.269
They&amp;#39;ve gone above and beyond.,2637.868,1.835
Not every plane can accommodate every,2639.703,1.402
member of the press.,2641.105,1.434
The Press: You couldn&amp;#39;t get a bigger plane?,2642.539,0.935
Mr. Spicer: It&amp;#39;s not a question --,2643.474,0.567
there&amp;#39;s an element of tax --,2644.041,1.034
The Press: Most Secretaries of,2645.075,0.601
State can accommodate that.,2645.676,1.034
Mr. Spicer: Thank you.,2646.71,0.634
"I understand that, and there&amp;#39;s an element of",2647.344,1.201
cost-savings at this point that the Secretary is,2648.545,1.569
trying to achieve.,2650.114,1.468

component to every stop of the Secretary&amp;#39;s trip.,2653.717,4.538
He is doing everything he can to logistically,2658.255,2.169
support the press who wants to come and cover,2660.424,1.134
"him, and they are being open to make sure that",2661.558,3.037
Secretary is available throughout the trip.,2664.595,2.068
The Press: President Trump has been -- was very,2666.663,3.237
critical of German Chancellor Merkel,2669.9,2.903
on the campaign trail.,2672.803,2.202
"I was just wondering, how does the White House think",2675.005,3.504
"that will affect the tone of the meeting on Tuesday,",2678.509,2.102
and what type of tone does,2680.611,0.634
the President plan to take?,2681.245,1.234
Mr. Spicer: I know that we did a bit of a readout,2682.479,2.636
earlier today on that.,2685.115,1.268
There&amp;#39;s a lot of excitement on both sides,2686.383,1.502
of the ocean for this trip.,2687.885,4.304
I know that we are looking forward to meeting with,2692.189,2.035
"the Chancellor and her team, and I&amp;#39;ve talked to",2694.224,1.969
their folks over there and they&amp;#39;re very excited,2696.193,1.935
about coming over.,2698.128,1.468
There&amp;#39;s a lot of trade and economic interests on both,2699.596,2.436
"sides, and obviously there&amp;#39;s an element of",2702.032,1.769
national security that we share.,2703.801,3.336
And so I will let the trip&amp;#39;s -- look forward to,2707.137,2.169
"the readout, but there is a lot of excitement coming.",2709.306,3.971
And I think the President looks forward to meeting,2713.277,1.902
with the Chancellor and discussing areas of shared,2715.179,3.703
national interest with her. Athena.,2718.882,0.768
The Press: Just following up on all of this,2719.65,1.334
Flynn discussion.,2720.984,0.868
"I gather from today and yesterday, correct me if",2721.852,2.869
"I&amp;#39;m wrong, I want to make sure I understand the",2724.721,1.502
answer to this question.,2726.223,1.735
Are you saying the President was not aware,2727.958,1.969
that Lieutenant General Michael Flynn was acting,2729.927,3.67
as a foreign agent when he appointed him to be,2733.597,2.169
national security advisor?,2735.766,1.335
Mr. Spicer: Correct.,2737.101,1.034
"Well, and just remember, you wouldn&amp;#39;t know",2738.135,1.702
that until he filed.,2739.837,1.835
"He didn&amp;#39;t file until two days ago, so therefore,",2741.672,2.002
nobody would have known that because he hadn&amp;#39;t,2743.674,1.668
filed as a foreign agent until two days ago.,2745.342,2.77
The Press: M understanding is that he,2748.112,1.334
had filed a lobbying disclosure with,2749.446,0.868
Congress in November.,2750.314,1.368
"Mr. Spicer: Again, that&amp;#39;s different than filing a",2751.682,1.535
FARA request with the DOJ.,2753.217,1.434
The Press: And one more question --,2754.651,0.601
"Mr. Spicer: Well, it&amp;#39;s one-question Friday.",2755.252,1.134
(Laughter.),2756.386,1.035
The Press: It&amp;#39;s very much attached to this.,2757.421,0.934
Mr. Spicer: All right.,2758.355,1.301
"The Press: The other question is, did Flynn",2759.656,1.502
disclose he was acting as a foreign agent in the,2761.158,2.769
security clearance review before he became NSA?,2763.927,3.637
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know the answer,2767.564,0.834
to that question.,2768.398,0.634
That&amp;#39;s something that you should follow up with,2769.032,1.569
General Flynn on. April.,2770.601,2.869
"The Press: Sean, I want to go back to the numbers.",2773.47,0.934
When is it when a former President&amp;#39;s spillover ends,2774.404,5.439
and the new President stands on his own merit?,2779.843,2.636
When does that happen?,2782.479,1.135
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think on January 20th at noon,",2783.614,2.669
"you start to assume command of the government,",2786.283,2.636
and -- what specifically are you asking for?,2788.919,3.003
The Press: The numbers from jobs.,2791.922,2.169
"You&amp;#39;re taking -- Mr. Spicer: Well, I think",2794.091,1.468
that this is the first full month that,2795.559,1.201
encapsulates the President&amp;#39;s administration.,2796.76,3.57
I think that&amp;#39;s a very telling number.,2800.33,1.969
"Look, and I get it.",2802.299,1.835
These numbers are going to go up and down.,2804.134,0.901
"But I think for the first full month, we&amp;#39;re seeing",2805.035,1.435
the enthusiasm and spirit that so many business,2806.47,3.036
"leaders have been drawn to, and that is",2809.506,4.071
exciting as a first month.,2813.577,2.035
But I think this encapsulates a full 30,2815.612,2.67
"days of the Trump presidency, and so we&amp;#39;re",2818.282,2.802
going to continue to work forward with policies that,2821.084,2.736
"will lower regulation and lower taxes, create a more",2823.82,2.57
business-friendly and entrepreneur-friendly,2826.39,2.102
business climate to allow the expansion of U.S.,2828.492,3.537
companies and grow U.S. jobs.,2832.029,1.801
"The Press: And lastly, over the last couple of",2833.83,1.469
"weeks we&amp;#39;ve heard all the negatives -- well, not all",2835.299,2.469
"the negatives, but a large portion of negatives about",2837.768,3.637
"the Affordable Care Act, and how you&amp;#39;re looking to",2841.405,2.102
make it patient care.,2843.507,1.201
"So with that, are there any positives which you",2844.708,4.605
could articulate from ACA that will carry into,2849.313,2.936
possibly patient care?,2852.249,1.835
Mr. Spicer: I think children being able to,2854.084,1.301
stay on their plans to 26.,2855.385,1.802
There&amp;#39;s a preexisting-condition piece.,2857.187,2.169
"But again, remember --",2859.356,1.134
"The Press: That&amp;#39;s going to states,",2860.49,0.601
the way we understand it.,2861.091,0.634
That&amp;#39;s subject to --,2861.725,0.534
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, no,",2862.259,0.934
but that -- you&amp;#39;re asking if there&amp;#39;s elements.,2863.193,1.368
"I think those are some things that -- and again,",2864.561,2.102
"remember, there was some stuff that was part of the",2866.663,2.269
ACA that is stuff that Republicans had supported,2868.932,2.269
for a while as well.,2871.201,1.201
I think this is making sure that this is the most,2872.402,2.203
effective and comprehensive healthcare,2874.605,2.335
policy that achieves the President&amp;#39;s goals.,2876.94,2.536
The Press: So those are the only two?,2879.476,0.868
Those are two --,2880.344,0.467
Mr. Spicer: Yes. You asked --,2880.811,0.734
"I don&amp;#39;t know, April, I&amp;#39;m sure I could go",2881.545,1.735
through the bill and get back.,2883.28,1.802
"It&amp;#39;s very long, as you saw the other day.",2885.082,1.601
It&amp;#39;s a thousand-page --,2886.683,1.502
The Press: -- pages versus --,2888.185,0.801
Mr. Spicer: Nine hundred seventy four pages. Very good.,2888.986,0.834
David Jackson.,2889.82,1.701
The Press: The Palestinians are saying,2891.521,1.769
that President Trump invited President Abbas to,2893.29,1.535
the White House for a meeting very soon.,2894.825,1.268
Can you confirm that?,2896.093,1.334
Mr. Spicer: I can.,2897.427,1.235
Thank you guys very much.,2898.662,0.601
Let&amp;#39;s end on a positive note.,2899.263,1.801
Have a great weekend.,2901.064,1.335
