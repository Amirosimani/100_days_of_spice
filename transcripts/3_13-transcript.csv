"Mr. Spicer: How&amp;#39;s my pin, John?",0.633,1.168
The Press: It looks good.,1.801,0.935
Mr. Spicer: Good,2.736,0.7
"The Press: The tie is good, the pin is good.",3.436,1.402
"Mr. Spicer: All right, then we&amp;#39;re ready to go.",4.838,1.268
The Press: Ready to go.,6.106,1.067
"Mr. Spicer: Good afternoon, everyone.",7.173,1.035
I hope you all had a great weekend.,8.208,1.434
The President spent his weekend in a series of,9.642,1.936
meetings with White House staff and advisors,11.578,2.869
planning for a full and productive week.,14.447,2.202
"On Saturday, as many of you saw, the President had",16.649,2.169
a working lunch with several members of his,18.818,2.536
"team, including Homeland Security Kelly, Treasury",21.354,2.536
"Secretary Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Ross,",23.89,3.337
"Veterans Secretary Shulkin, and members of",27.227,2.302
"his White House staff, during which they",29.529,2.202
discussed immigration reform and their efforts,31.731,3.337
to repeal and replace Obamacare.,35.068,2.336
"Over the weekend, the Vice President went down to",37.404,1.634
"Louisville, Kentucky.",39.038,1.535
He was joined by Governor Matt Bevin for a listening,40.573,2.136
session with over a dozen small-business owners from,42.709,2.903
Kentucky to discuss the burdens that Obamacare has,45.612,2.836
inflicted on their businesses.,48.448,1.935
The Kentucky business owners shared in detail,50.383,1.902
how Obamacare is negatively affecting their,52.285,2.769
"businesses, and reiterated their support for",55.054,2.603
repealing our current healthcare system and,57.657,1.902
replacing with one that actually works.,59.559,3.136
"This morning, after receiving his intelligence",62.695,2.403
"briefing, the President led another listening",65.098,2.135
session on healthcare with Secretary of Health and,67.233,2.403
"Human Services, Dr. Tom Price.",69.636,2.169
The President and Secretary Price heard from,71.805,1.901
nine concerned Americans from across the country,73.706,2.97
who have been failed by the broken promises of,76.676,1.969
"Obamacare, as well as two doctors who have seen",78.645,2.602
their patients suffer from the law&amp;#39;s misguided,81.247,2.536
rules and requirements.,83.783,1.935
This listening session was another important step in,85.718,2.503
the process of crafting and implementing an,88.221,2.469
effective patient-centered healthcare.,90.69,2.569
Americans have been watching their healthcare,93.259,1.569
costs skyrocket while their choices of providers,94.828,2.836
and insurers have dwindled for years.,97.664,3.603
They&amp;#39;ve received those cancellations in the mail,101.267,1.969
as many as three times.,103.236,1.001
They&amp;#39;ve seen urgent care and emergency rooms filled,104.237,2.669
with people who can&amp;#39;t afford their high,106.906,3.037
deductibles and resorted to enduring the pain or,109.943,2.669
sickness until they had no choice but to,112.612,2.035
go to a hospital.,114.647,1.435
They&amp;#39;ve had family members with chronic preexisting,116.082,2.202
conditions whose cost of healthcare has,118.284,3.17
more than doubled.,121.454,1.168
And they&amp;#39;ve been forced to let go of valued employees,122.622,2.569
"or, frankly, unable to hire more due to",125.191,2.369
staggering workers&amp;#39; compensation increases.,127.56,2.703
The President campaigned on a pledge to repeal and,130.263,3.103
replace this unraveling system.,133.366,2.436
The American Health Care Act is one part of,135.802,1.968
fulfilling this pledge;,137.77,1.402
it&amp;#39;s far from the only one.,139.172,1.635
He&amp;#39;s using administrative action to provide,140.807,1.968
"essential regulatory relief to insurers,",142.775,2.636
"increasing coverage choices, and providing",145.411,2.036
lower-premium options to individuals and families.,147.447,3.136
He will continue to work with Congress on the,150.583,1.769
"additional legislation, part of this three-prong",152.352,2.836
strategy to increase choice while decreasing,155.188,3.27
"prices, including allowing health insurance to be",158.458,2.836
"sold across state lines, adding to the list of",161.294,2.836
healthcare-related costs patients conduct with,164.13,2.903
"their health savings accounts, streamlining the",167.033,2.503
process at the FDA so that lower-priced generic,169.536,3.536
"medicine gets to the market faster, inviting",173.072,2.67
small business to band together to negotiate for,175.742,2.536
"lower health insurance for all their employees, and",178.278,2.936
reforming the medical malpractice lawsuit system,181.214,2.703
so that doctors are not forced to perform,183.917,1.768
unnecessary and costly procedures and tests out,185.685,2.87
of fear of future litigation.,188.555,3.136
"Our healthcare system is large, complex, and",191.691,2.703
critically important not only to the health of our,194.394,1.768
"citizens, but to the health of our economy.",196.162,2.97
"Through commonsense, patient-focused reforms,",199.132,2.936
the President will work with Congress to create a,202.068,1.969
new system that doesn&amp;#39;t impose a,204.037,2.002
"one-size-fits-all, government-knows-best",206.039,2.802
vision on the American people.,208.841,2.269
We will empower the American people to make,211.11,1.702
their own choices about healthcare that make them,212.812,3.003
"best work for themselves and their family, that",215.815,1.835
will bring costs for everyone down.,217.65,2.87
"After the listening session, the President had",220.52,1.701
lunch with Vice President Pence and Secretary of,222.221,2.336
Transportation Chao.,224.557,1.668
"Later this afternoon, the President will welcome all",226.225,2.036
of his confirmed Cabinet members to the White House,228.261,2.703
for their first Cabinet meeting.,230.964,1.735
This meeting is an important opportunity for,232.699,1.735
the President to share his vision with the country,234.434,2.302
"with his Cabinet members, providing direction for",236.736,2.102
them to bring back to their agencies and,238.838,2.302
"departments, to ensure that the entire",241.14,2.102
administration is working towards the same goals.,243.242,3.204
"Unfortunately, this afternoon, you&amp;#39;ll see some",246.446,1.635
empty chairs around the table representing the,248.081,2.302
President&amp;#39;s four nominees who have yet to be,250.383,1.969
confirmed by the Senate -- Secretary of,252.352,2.002
"Agriculture-designee Governor Perdue, Secretary",254.354,2.969
of Labor-designee Alex Acosta; Director of,257.323,2.936
"National Intelligence-designee,",260.259,1.369
"former Senator Coats, and United States Trade",261.628,2.902
"Representative-designee, Robert Lighthizer.",264.53,2.403
Senate Democrats have drawn out this entire,266.933,1.835
"process for way too long, and these key agencies and",268.768,2.936
departments will not be represented at the,271.704,1.802
President&amp;#39;s first Cabinet meeting.,273.506,2.302
The President is confident in these unquestionable,275.808,2.503
abilities of the confirmed Cabinet members that,278.311,1.868
will be in attendance.,280.179,1.335
He is just as confident in the demonstrated quality,281.514,2.236
of the four individuals who will not,283.75,2.502
be able to attend.,286.252,1.168
Their absence will clearly be felt as this,287.42,2.002
administration comes together for the first,289.422,2.102
"time to receive guidance from, and provide counsel",291.524,3.203
"to, the President on these unique areas",294.727,2.436
of jurisdiction.,297.163,1.235
"Following the Cabinet meeting, the President",298.398,1.401
will sign an executive order to reorganize the,299.799,2.035
federal government.,301.834,1.168
This order requires a thorough examination of,303.002,2.069
every executive department and agency to identify,305.071,3.003
money -- where money is being wasted and how,308.074,2.336
"services can be improved, and whether or not the",310.41,2.702
programs are truly serving the American people.,313.112,3.237
This is the beginning of a long-overdue,316.349,2.302
reorganization of the federal government and,318.651,2.569
another significant step towards the President&amp;#39;s,321.22,2.503
"often-stated goal of making it more efficient,",323.723,2.736
effective and accountable to the American people.,326.459,3.237
"This evening, the President will have dinner",329.696,1.368
with Secretary of State Tillerson and National,331.064,2.669
Security Advisor McMaster.,333.733,2.135
"Also, he hopes to see Seema Verma confirmed as",335.868,3.337
the administrator of Centers for Medicare and,339.205,2.736
"Medicaid Services, another unquestionably qualified",341.941,3.437
nominee who&amp;#39;s been shamelessly prevented from,345.378,2.235
taking her position at a critical post.,347.613,2.77
Let me just kind of touch on the week ahead.,350.383,2.102
"Tomorrow, based on the current forecast, we are",352.485,3.67
currently in conversations -- in contact with,356.155,2.97
officials in the Chancellor&amp;#39;s office in,359.125,1.835
Germany regarding the visit.,360.96,1.835
We&amp;#39;ll have an update regarding that,362.795,1.335
visit later today.,364.13,1.635
"On Wednesday, the President will visit",365.765,1.702
Detroit for a trip focusing on job creation,367.467,2.636
and automobile manufacturing.,370.103,2.002
He will meet with auto executives and workers and,372.105,2.068
manufacturing suppliers highlighting the need to,374.173,2.77
eliminate burdensome regulations that,376.943,1.802
needlessly hinder meaningful job growth.,378.745,2.836
"Also on Wednesday, the President will visit",381.581,1.601
"Nashville, where he will lay a wreath at President",383.182,2.336
Andrew Jackson&amp;#39;s tomb at the Hermitage.,385.518,2.336
"And as I told you last week, on Thursday the",387.854,2.269
President will welcome the Taoiseach of Ireland for,390.123,3.169
the traditional St. Patrick&amp;#39;s Day visit.,393.292,2.269
I can also confirm that the Deputy Crown Prince of,395.561,2.736
"Saudi Arabia, Mohammad bin Salman, will have a",398.297,2.803
meeting with the President on Thursday of this week.,401.1,2.503
I will have further details on that,403.603,2.202
visit for you soon.,405.805,3.27
"And on Friday, the President will travel to",409.075,1.735
Mar-a-Lago for the weekend.,410.81,1.635
"Finally, the President is aware of the forecast for",412.445,2.602
the storm that&amp;#39;s currently threatening the Northeast.,415.047,2.77
The President has been briefed by his Homeland,417.817,1.668
Security Advisor and the acting FEMA administrator,419.485,3.07
on storm preparations.,422.555,1.034
He has directed his Intergovernmental Affairs,423.589,3.504
staff to remain in contact with governors and mayors,427.093,4.071
in the path of the storm.,431.164,1.201
He has directed his acting FEMA administrator to lean,432.365,3.136
forward and be prepared to help states should they,435.501,3.037
require federal assistance.,438.538,1.735
We urge everyone to listen to state and local leaders,440.273,3.47
and public safety officials to follow their,443.743,1.935
warning and closure notice.,445.678,1.568
They are the best source of information,447.246,2.836
during that storm.,450.082,1.168
"With that, I&amp;#39;d be glad to take your questions. John.",451.25,2.436
"The Press: Sean, if I could come",453.686,1.668
back to the U.S.,455.354,0.968
"attorney for the southern district of New York,",456.322,2.636
"Preet Bharara, who was asked to resign along with",458.958,2.836
45 other U.S. attorneys.,461.794,3.003
The President seemed to indicate not too long ago,464.797,2.936
"that he wanted Mr. Bharara to stay on in that job,",467.733,2.736
and he was asked to resign like the other attorneys.,470.469,1.936
And then he says he was fired on Saturday when he,472.405,2.569
refused to resign.,474.974,1.201
Did the President change his mind about keeping him on?,476.175,2.67
Or was it only supposed to be for a finite period of time?,478.845,2.602
Can you just fill us in?,481.447,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m going to refer you to the,482.114,1.368
Department of Justice on that.,483.482,1.602
This is a standard operating procedure for a,485.084,3.27
new administration around this time to ask for the,488.354,2.603
resignation of all the U.S. attorneys.,490.957,1.468
We had most of them -- or a good chunk of them had,492.425,2.202
already submitted their resignation letter.,494.627,2.636
This is just the final swath of individuals who,497.263,2.502
had not at this time.,499.765,1.802
But this is common practice of,501.567,1.769
most administrations.,503.336,3.069
The Press: I understand that this happened at the,506.405,1.702
"DOJ and the request was from the DOJ, but there",508.107,2.136
seems to a White House connection vis-à-vis the,510.243,1.968
fact that the President had actually asked him to,512.211,2.77
"stay on, and then the President apparently",514.981,1.835
called him a couple of days before he was,516.816,2.202
allegedly fired.,519.018,1.134
Can you tell us what that was all about?,520.152,1.469
And did the President change his mind?,521.621,1.368
"Mr. Spicer: No, the President was calling to",522.989,1.768
thank him for his service.,524.757,1.068
"This is, as I said, a standard action that takes",525.825,3.837
place at most administrations.,529.662,2.135
Then-Attorney General Reno sent out an almost,531.797,3.771
identical letter in 1993.,535.568,2.102
"The Bush administration sent out a similar one,",537.67,3.537
as well.,541.207,0.667
So this is a very common practice for all political,541.874,3.904
appointees -- not just in the Department of Justice,545.778,2.035
-- but throughout government when there&amp;#39;s a,547.813,1.335
turnover administration to ask for all individuals,549.148,2.136
to do that. Major.,551.284,0.667
"The Press: Sean, yesterday John McCain said the",551.951,2.002
President should either provide information about,553.953,2.502
the allegation he put on Twitter a week ago,556.455,2.136
"Saturday, about his phones being tapped at Trump",558.591,1.868
"Tower, or retract his statement.",560.459,1.368
Today is the deadline.,561.827,0.768
What&amp;#39;s the President going to do?,562.595,1.401
"Mr. Spicer: Well, let&amp;#39;s be clear -- the Department of",563.996,2.069
Justice was asked to send information,566.065,4.204
down to Congress.,570.269,1.068
It wasn&amp;#39;t the White House that was asked to do that.,571.337,1.802
Just so we&amp;#39;re clear as far as what the request was.,573.139,2.803
The Press: But the tweet came from the President,575.942,0.767
of the United States.,576.709,0.567
Mr. Spicer: I understand that.,577.276,0.534
And with the tweet --,577.81,0.334
The Press: Does he have an,578.144,0.467
"obligation, as Senator McCain said,",578.611,1.068
to clear this up?,579.679,0.7
Mr. Spicer: And I think if you look at the,580.379,1.135
"President&amp;#39;s tweet, he said very clearly &amp;quot;wiretapping&amp;quot;",581.514,3.036
in quotes.,584.55,1.502
There&amp;#39;s been substantial discussion in several,586.052,3.136
reports that Bret Baier from Fox on March 3rd,589.188,5.339
talked about evidence of wiretapping.,594.527,1.868
There&amp;#39;s been reports in The New York Times and the,596.395,1.635
BBC and other outlets about other aspects of,598.03,3.003
surveillance that have occurred.,601.033,1.735
The President was very clear in his tweet that it,602.768,2.236
"was wiretapping, that that spans a whole host of",605.004,4.271
surveillance types of options.,609.275,2.102
The House and the Senate intelligence committees,611.377,2.703
will now look into that and provide a report back.,614.08,3.136
But I think that there has been numerous reports from,617.216,2.803
a variety of outlets over the last couple months,620.019,4.404
that seem to indicate that there has been different,624.423,4.972
types of surveillance that occurred during,629.395,1.768
the 2016 election.,631.163,1.202
The Press: And so what you&amp;#39;re saying is the,632.365,2.469
President doesn&amp;#39;t have an obligation to,634.834,2.469
provide any evidence?,637.303,1.234
"Mr. Spicer: No, I&amp;#39;m not saying that at all.",638.537,0.634
Not at all.,639.171,0.534
What I&amp;#39;m saying is the request that was made from,639.705,2.469
the House was to the Department of Justice.,642.174,2.203
I think that that&amp;#39;s an appropriate question,644.377,1.701
to ask them.,646.078,0.901
"What I&amp;#39;m telling you is, from a White House",646.979,1.468
"perspective, there&amp;#39;s no question that there have",648.447,3.27
been an abundance of reports regarding,651.717,2.569
surveillance and other type of activities that,654.286,2.369
occurred during the 2016 election.,656.655,1.635
The Press: And that leads us to believe that the,658.29,1.569
President&amp;#39;s only evidence are these reports?,659.859,2.402
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, that leads you to believe that.",662.261,2.336
I&amp;#39;m saying to you --,664.597,0.767
The Press: I&amp;#39;m trying to --,665.364,0.668
Mr. Spicer: And I&amp;#39;m saying to you is that what we,666.032,1.334
made clear on that Sunday was that the House and,667.366,2.069
"Senate intelligence committees have the means,",669.435,1.668
"the process, and the access to go in and look",671.103,2.336
at the entirety of the evidence that&amp;#39;s being,673.439,1.768
presented to them and make a determination that they,675.207,2.436
can report back to us.,677.643,1.001
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",678.644,1.802
"Following up on Major&amp;#39;s question, does the",680.446,2.169
"President feel he has an obligation, once the",682.615,2.002
"investigation is over, to release some sort of",684.617,3.103
statement in response to whatever the findings are?,687.72,3.003
That&amp;#39;s my first question.,690.723,1.768
I have a second one for you.,692.491,1.669
"Mr. Spicer: Well, let&amp;#39;s get there first.",694.16,1.501
I think to start to presume what the outcome,695.661,2.803
is going to be before the House and the Senate look,698.464,2.035
at all of the evidence and information and reports,700.499,2.903
that are presented to them would be a,703.402,1.335
bit presumptuous.,704.737,0.967
"So I think -- let&amp;#39;s slow down a little, let them",705.704,3.504
"look at everything, and then let them make",709.208,2.069
some determinations.,711.277,0.734
The Press: And then my second question for you:,712.011,1.468
Has President Trump donated his paycheck from,713.479,2.436
"the month of February, like he promised to do",715.915,2.469
during the campaign?,718.384,0.834
Mr. Spicer: The President&amp;#39;s intention,719.218,2.035
right now is to donate his salary at the end of the,721.253,2.937
"year, and he has kindly asked that you all help",724.19,3.67
determine where that goes.,727.86,1.134
The way that we can avoid scrutiny is to let the,728.994,3.804
press corps determine where it should go.,732.798,2.236
(Laughter.),735.034,0.667
"The Press: Oh, we have a few ideas.",735.701,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: In all seriousness, I think his",737.036,1.334
"view is he made a pledge to the American people, he",738.37,2.002
wants to donate it to charity.,740.372,2.703
And he&amp;#39;d love your help to determine where,743.075,1.835
it should go.,744.91,0.668
The Press: May I suggest the,745.578,0.734
Correspondents Association --,746.312,1.201
Mr. Spicer: That will be a great way --,747.513,2.069
The Press: Journalism scholarship.,749.582,1.334
Mr. Spicer: That would be a great way to do it.,750.916,1.335
"The Press: Thanks a lot, Sean.",752.251,1.602
I wanted to follow up with you on questions regarding,753.853,2.802
"Michael Flynn, who&amp;#39;s no longer in",756.655,2.536
the administration.,759.191,0.968
There&amp;#39;s a five-year lobbying ban that&amp;#39;s been,760.159,3.337
imposed upon all Trump administration employees.,763.496,2.969
Does that also apply to Michael Flynn?,766.465,1.835
Would he not be permitted to lobby now for five,768.3,2.736
years because of the agreement that he signed,771.036,2.436
when he became the national security advisor?,773.472,2.169
Mr. Spicer: That would be correct.,775.641,1.468
I&amp;#39;d have to check and actually figure out when,777.109,2.836
he signed or if he signed the form.,779.945,1.402
"But yes, all administration officials",781.347,2.102
who come in are required to sign that ethics pledge,783.449,3.036
banning them from lobbying for five years and then a,786.485,2.77
lifetime ban on lobbying on behalf of any,789.255,2.102
foreign government.,791.357,0.734
"The Press: And then related to that, what are",792.091,2.069
the repercussions if an employee of this,794.16,2.936
administration lobbies within five years?,797.096,4.304
"Where&amp;#39;s the teeth, what&amp;#39;s the penalty, what&amp;#39;s the",801.4,2.369
punishment that would be imposed on that particular,803.769,4.471
Trump administration employee?,808.24,0.734
"Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;d have to get back to you, John.",808.974,1.835
I don&amp;#39;t know whether that&amp;#39;s a Department of,810.809,2.002
"Justice aspect or not, but I will get back. Yeah.",812.811,3.27
"The Press: I was wondering, did the",816.081,2.069
President ask Preet Bharara to stay on during,818.15,2.136
their conversation during the transition or not?,820.286,1.501
Mr. Spicer: I was not privy to,821.787,1.168
that conversation.,822.955,2.369
"Again, I&amp;#39;m not really sure how it&amp;#39;s relevant at",825.324,2.836
the end of the day.,828.16,0.667
The Department of Justice asked all remaining 46 at,828.827,4.772
"this time, that they asked for all of them to submit",833.599,1.868
their letters of resignation based on the,835.467,2.369
same kind of precedent that was set during both,837.836,3.07
the Clinton and then the Bush administrations in,840.906,4.705
terms of the timeline and format. Jessica.,845.611,1.535
The Press: I just wanted to ask about the reports,847.146,3.703
about President Xi Jinping visiting Mar-a-Lago,850.849,2.169
April 6th and 7th.,853.018,1.302
Can you confirm that visit and talk about what you,854.32,1.801
want to accomplish with that type of,856.121,2.369
less formal visit?,858.49,1.569
"And secondly, with respect to that visit, you still",860.059,1.668
"don&amp;#39;t have a confirmed ambassador, you don&amp;#39;t have",861.727,3.47
an assistant Secretary of State for East Asia Affairs.,865.197,3.037
House ow does that affect your planning and ability,868.234,2.635
to really properly brief the President and make,870.869,2.036
sure he has a strong position?,872.905,1.702
Mr. Spicer: Planning is ongoing for a visit,874.607,2.102
between President Trump and President Xi at a,876.709,3.036
date to be determined.,879.745,1.435
"We&amp;#39;re not ready to confirm that, and we will",881.18,1.868
have more details.,883.048,2.236
"It&amp;#39;s the purpose of this meeting, of that kind of a",885.284,2.736
"meeting, to help defuse tensions over North Korea",888.02,3.07
and the recent deployment of a THAAD military,891.09,2.068
battery to South Korea.,893.158,2.136
Any meeting between the President of the United,895.294,1.935
States and the People&amp;#39;s Republic of China would,897.229,1.835
necessarily cover a broad range of topics,899.064,2.903
of mutual concern.,901.967,2.002
Secretary Tillerson is traveling to,903.969,1.101
the region now.,905.07,1.669
So I think as we go forward we will have,906.739,1.935
additional details on both the timing and the,908.674,2.97
location of that when we go forward.,911.644,2.535
The Press: Is the implication of you saying,914.179,1.102
Tillerson is traveling that he&amp;#39;s setting up,915.281,2.369
"the visit, Sean?",917.65,0.634
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sorry?,918.284,0.6
The Press: Is the implication of you talking,918.884,1.235
about Tillerson&amp;#39;s visit that he&amp;#39;s going to be,920.119,1.434
laying the groundwork for --,921.553,0.735
"Mr. Spicer: Well, he&amp;#39;s in the region.",922.288,1.301
"I&amp;#39;m sure that in his visit to Japan, South Korea and",923.589,2.669
then China that preparations will come up,926.258,2.302
as well as areas of mutual concern.,928.56,2.803
"The Press: Sean, there&amp;#39;s been a rash of --",931.363,1.502
Mr. Spicer: What&amp;#39;s that?,932.865,0.467
The Press: Is it me?,933.332,0.634
Mr. Spicer: Sure.,933.966,0.967
Let&amp;#39;s go one at a time.,936.368,0.701
The Press: There&amp;#39;s been a rash of attacks on LGBT,937.803,3.203
community centers throughout the nation.,941.006,1.869
"Over the weekend, the community center here in",942.875,2.068
"D.C., Casa Ruby, was attacked and a transgender",944.943,2.236
staffer was assaulted.,947.179,2.469
This follows similar attacks that have taken,949.648,1.769
"place in recent days in Orlando, Florida, New",951.417,2.102
Jersey and Oklahoma.,953.519,1.468
This is not unlike the anti-Semitism that the,954.987,1.868
President has already denounced.,956.855,1.902
Will the President also denounce these attacks?,958.757,1.669
Mr. Spicer: Sure.,960.426,0.867
"I mean, I think that -- I think one of the points",961.293,2.002
that we&amp;#39;ve made in previous statements on,963.295,3.137
this is that this is not the way that we as,966.799,2.502
Americans solve our differences.,969.635,1.368
We don&amp;#39;t attack each other.,971.003,1.101
We don&amp;#39;t engage in this kind of behavior.,972.104,4.571
I think we have a First Amendment that allows us,976.675,2.002
"to express ourselves, and that&amp;#39;s the appropriate way.",978.677,4.304
But doing it when you&amp;#39;re threatening violence or,982.981,1.869
destruction or vandalism is inappropriate in,984.85,2.369
all of its forms.,987.219,1.635
The Press: Is it connected to the withdrawal of the,988.854,1.502
"transgender guidance, do you think?",990.356,0.967
Mr. Spicer: Is it what?,991.323,1.301
The Press: Is it at all connected --,992.624,0.501
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t believe there is any connection,993.125,1.702
between -- I,994.827,1.001
"think that that would be a stretch, to say the least.",995.828,3.236
"Yes, ma&amp;#39;am.",999.064,1.368
The Press: Thanks for taking my question.,1000.432,1.335
I wanted to ask about North Korea.,1001.767,1.034
You mentioned North Korea.,1002.801,1.168
Can you tell us a little bit about the review of,1003.969,1.335
North Korea right now and what direction you think,1005.304,2.369
the administration is going in terms of the,1007.673,1.735
relationship -- trying to manage the threat,1009.408,2.402
from North Korea?,1011.81,1.302
"Mr. Spicer: As I mentioned, Secretary",1013.112,0.767
Tillerson is heading to the region.,1013.879,1.335
He&amp;#39;ll meet with his counterparts in South,1015.214,1.768
"Korea, Japan, and then ultimately in Beijing.",1016.982,2.77
That&amp;#39;s obviously going to be a major subject.,1019.752,1.701
"And as I mentioned, when we ultimately meet with",1021.453,4.672
"President Xi and others, that will be a discussion;",1026.125,2.502
it&amp;#39;s something that&amp;#39;s he&amp;#39;s talked about prior to the,1028.627,2.603
"resignation of the last South Korean President,",1031.23,3.403
and was something that has been part of an,1034.633,0.801
ongoing discussion.,1035.434,1.702
So there&amp;#39;s an internal review that we continue to,1037.136,2.736
"have, but then there&amp;#39;s obviously a geopolitical",1039.872,1.601
conversation we&amp;#39;re having with partners in the,1042.508,2.936
region as we look to contain North Korea&amp;#39;s,1045.444,2.135
military threat.,1047.579,1.068
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",1048.647,1.802
Can you confirm that any cooperation with Russia,1050.449,3.303
with regard to Syria is off the table?,1053.752,2.302
"And if not, is it fair to say that the forthcoming",1056.054,3.204
anti-ISIS plan does include some sort of,1059.258,2.669
cooperation with Russia?,1061.927,1.668
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to get into what the plan,1063.595,2.069
"-- I mean, the plan is not done yet.",1065.664,1.602
"As I mentioned a couple days ago, Secretary Mattis",1067.266,2.802
"was briefing the principals, and that plan",1070.068,3.704
is continuing to evolve.,1073.772,1.702
So I&amp;#39;m not going to start to rule out one country.,1075.474,1.935
But I think the President has been very clear in the,1077.409,2.136
past that if a country shares our commitment to,1079.545,2.335
defeating ISIS and we can work with them in an area,1081.88,2.336
"of shared, mutual concern, then we will do so.",1084.216,4.404
The Press: Second question.,1088.62,1.535
A Kremlin spokesperson said that Russian,1090.155,4.271
President Putin and President Trump will,1094.426,2.369
meet at the G-20.,1096.795,1.935
Can you confirm that?,1098.73,2.169
And would the White House move on a possibility of a,1100.899,1.835
meeting before that?,1102.734,1.936
Mr. Spicer: I will follow up on that.,1104.67,2.135
I don&amp;#39;t have a date.,1106.805,1.168
I know that the team is working very actively with,1107.973,2.269
respect to bilateral meetings at the G20.,1110.242,3.003
I don&amp;#39;t have anything for you on that. Roberta.,1113.245,2.569
The Press: Director Mulvaney said yesterday,1115.814,1.502
that he felt that the Obama administration had,1117.316,3.67
been manipulating the unemployment rate.,1120.986,1.835
I&amp;#39;m wondering if that&amp;#39;s a view that the,1122.821,1.268
President shares. And what evidence is there of --,1124.089,2.002
Mr. Spicer: I think he,1126.091,1.034
"was clearly referring to Obamacare, the",1127.125,1.736
number of people.,1128.861,1.668
But I would refer you back to him and his comments,1130.529,2.402
with respect to how he characterized that.,1132.931,3.437
I think he can discuss the precise nature of what,1136.368,3.07
he meant on that.,1139.438,1.735
The Press: Does the President feel that the,1141.173,1.134
Obama administration had been manipulating --,1142.307,2.369
Mr. Spicer: I think you know what the,1144.676,0.768
President&amp;#39;s view is.,1145.444,1.601
He&amp;#39;s made very clear in the past what his comments,1147.045,1.602
were on how those numbers were articulated,1148.647,3.604
in the past.,1152.251,0.5
And I think there&amp;#39;s a question between the total,1152.751,2.336
"number of people that are employed, and the",1155.087,1.401
President&amp;#39;s comments in the past have reflected,1156.788,1.836
that his big concern was getting to the bottom of,1159.091,3.503
"how many people are working in this country,",1162.594,2.036
and that the denominator -- meaning the percentage,1164.63,2.202
rate of the total number of people -- is not the,1168.066,2.369
most accurate reflection of how many people are,1170.769,1.735
employed in this country.,1172.938,1.301
"How many jobs are created, how many people are",1174.239,1.468
"getting back to work, how many companies are",1176.041,1.268
committing to hiring more people is a much more,1177.676,2.002
accurate assessment of where we&amp;#39;re headed as our,1180.012,1.535
"country -- where our employment is, where our",1181.813,1.902
economy is headed.,1183.949,1.168
But to look at a number and say we have 4.7 or 4.8,1185.117,3.17
or 5.9 percent unemployment is not,1188.587,2.436
necessarily an accurate reflection of how many,1191.023,1.768
"people are actually working, seeking work,",1192.791,2.903
or want to work.,1195.694,1.201
"And if you know how they conduct those surveys,",1196.895,2.036
"there&amp;#39;s a lot of times when people, whether",1198.931,1.668
"they&amp;#39;re older or younger, or because of how long",1200.599,1.668
"they&amp;#39;ve been searching for work, are not",1202.267,1.602
considered statistically viable,1203.869,1.501
anymore and they&amp;#39;re washed away.,1205.37,1.702
So I think how you look at the percentage of people,1207.072,2.069
working can sometimes be a manipulated number.,1209.141,2.436
The number of people that are added to the roll,1211.577,2.035
"every year -- every month, rather -- is a much more",1213.612,2.269
accurate understanding of what&amp;#39;s happening in,1215.881,1.601
the economy. Cecilia.,1217.482,2.303
The Press: I just want to clarify your answer to,1219.785,2.869
Major&amp;#39;s question.,1222.654,1.068
So will the DOJ and/or the administration comply with,1223.722,3.537
the deadline to supply information today?,1227.259,1.802
"Mr. Spicer: Remember, it&amp;#39;s the -- again, it&amp;#39;s not --",1229.061,4.037
"the request was made of the DOJ, and so the proper",1233.098,2.603
venue to ask that question,1236.335,1.201
of is the Department of Justice.,1238.136,1.502
"The Press: But surely, the White House knows whether",1239.638,0.934
there is or there is not evidence.,1240.572,1.001
"Mr. Spicer: You can&amp;#39;t -- because, it&amp;#39;s interesting,",1241.573,2.669
in the past whenever we&amp;#39;ve had these conversations,1244.242,2.169
"with another agency, the accusation from the press",1246.411,2.303
corps is that we&amp;#39;re interfering in something.,1248.714,2.168
So you can&amp;#39;t have it both ways.,1250.882,1.268
You can&amp;#39;t say that we&amp;#39;re interfering with someone,1252.15,2.937
"when we talk to them; when we don&amp;#39;t talk to them,",1255.087,1.468
it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;surely you must know.&amp;quot; So --,1256.555,1.334
The Press: So if the President tweets something --,1257.889,2.636
"Mr. Spicer: Hold on, Cecilia is asking",1260.525,1.635
a question.,1262.16,0.434
The Press: -- and then say it&amp;#39;s the Department,1262.594,1.235
Justice&amp;#39;s obligation --,1263.829,0.734
The Press: This is to follow up on --,1264.563,0.801
Mr. Spicer: I understand that.,1265.697,0.534
I saw the tick-tock.,1266.231,0.367
I understand it.,1266.598,0.401
That doesn&amp;#39;t mean you get to jump in. Cecilia.,1266.999,1.868
"The Press: So to follow up on Major&amp;#39;s point, though,",1268.867,1.668
this is a tweet from the President.,1270.535,2.002
Doesn&amp;#39;t the President have an obligation --,1272.537,2.269
"Mr. Spicer: And he does, and I think we&amp;#39;ve",1274.806,1.001
made it very --,1275.807,1.268
The Press: -- to make the evidence clear?,1277.075,1.468
"Mr. Spicer: Right, and we&amp;#39;ve made it very clear",1278.543,1.001
that we expect the House and the Senate,1279.544,0.968
Intelligence Committees to do their job.,1280.512,1.969
I think there&amp;#39;s a preponderance of reports,1282.481,2.369
that continues to come out about surveillance and,1284.85,2.435
actions that have occurred during the 2016 election.,1287.285,2.97
Once they come up with their report -- and it was,1290.255,1.769
asked earlier today -- I think we can talk about,1292.024,2.402
the conclusions of that report.,1294.426,1.568
"But at this time, you can&amp;#39;t say that we&amp;#39;re going",1295.994,2.102
to shift it off to the House and Senate and,1298.096,1.769
then comment every day.,1299.865,0.734
That was the entire goal of asking them to look,1300.599,2.369
into this further.,1302.968,1.134
The Press: But will DOJ comply with this,1304.102,1.502
deadline today?,1305.604,0.567
The clock is ticking.,1306.171,1.001
The Press: The President instructed them --,1307.172,1.001
Mr. Spicer: I understand.,1308.173,0.734
My understanding is that they will.,1308.907,0.734
"But again, I would ask them what their intention",1309.641,2.503
"is, and I believe there are certain things that",1312.144,2.335
they can and can&amp;#39;t do in,1314.479,1.235
terms of classification and stuff.,1315.714,1.735
But I would leave it up to the Department of Justice,1317.449,2.102
to answer for the Department of Justice. Kaitlan.,1319.551,1.735
The Press: How is the press making,1321.286,1.835
Obamacare look good?,1323.121,2.202
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think when you see some of these",1325.323,1.068
comparisons that occur in the -- talk about who&amp;#39;s,1326.391,2.67
"going to win and who&amp;#39;s going to lose, it misses a",1329.061,2.168
lot of the competition that&amp;#39;s going,1331.229,1.669
to take place.,1332.898,0.901
It doesn&amp;#39;t talk about the increased choice.,1333.799,2.002
"Right now, as the President has noted, as",1335.801,2.802
"Secretary Price has noted, in a third of all counties",1338.603,2.436
in five states you have one choice.,1341.039,3.137
Those analyses that are very -- trying to look at,1344.176,2.135
"how much you&amp;#39;ll pay and how much you won&amp;#39;t, A,",1346.311,1.835
don&amp;#39;t take into consideration the,1348.146,1.168
"competition that&amp;#39;s going to occur, the choice",1349.314,2.069
that&amp;#39;s going to occur.,1351.383,1.435
"I mean, right now, you have one choice in",1352.818,1.635
a lot of places.,1354.453,1.167
You have no decision about how much you&amp;#39;re going to,1355.62,1.635
pay and what you&amp;#39;re going to get.,1357.255,1.569
Choice allows you to determine what scale of,1358.824,2.369
"healthcare you need, what kind of package is good",1361.193,2.235
"for you, your family or for your business.",1363.428,2.236
And when you look at a lot of these analyses when you,1365.664,1.735
"open up various major papers, they make it seem",1367.399,2.302
so simple: it&amp;#39;s how much are you going to pay for,1369.701,3.237
"on this plan, how much are you going to pay for",1372.938,1.868
under the current plan.,1374.806,1.969
"It misses an entirety of the whole process, which",1376.775,2.903
"is that you don&amp;#39;t have competition, number one.",1379.678,2.369
"Number two, and the bigger point that I think the",1382.047,2.069
"President and a lot of others are getting to, is",1384.116,1.534
that the system is failing on its own.,1385.65,2.369
It makes it seem like it&amp;#39;s all rainbows and puppies.,1388.019,2.503
"At the end of the day, if you have a card and you&amp;#39;re",1390.522,3.47
"getting a subsidy but you&amp;#39;re not getting care,",1393.992,2.503
you have nothing.,1396.495,1.468
And so walking into a doctor&amp;#39;s office where you,1397.963,1.968
"can hand them a card and say, I&amp;#39;ve got a $5,000 tax",1399.931,2.603
subsidy -- if that doctor doesn&amp;#39;t take the care or,1402.534,2.669
"the deductible is so high, then you really",1405.203,1.735
don&amp;#39;t have anything.,1406.938,1.569
And so to do an apples-to-apples,1408.507,1.334
comparison is hardly an accurate analysis of what,1409.841,3.47
the current situation is. Zeke.,1413.311,2.069
The Press: Just going back to the counter-ISIS plan,1415.38,2.469
"you mentioned earlier, the plan isn&amp;#39;t don&amp;#39;t yet.",1417.849,1.535
The President during the campaign said multiple,1419.384,2.369
times that within 30 days he wanted that,1421.753,1.568
plan presented to him.,1423.321,1.202
Obviously it&amp;#39;s undergoing comments at the National,1424.523,1.701
Security Council principals level.,1426.224,2.603
But is the President upset that he hasn&amp;#39;t,1428.827,1.435
received it yet?,1430.262,1.501
And does that point to a difference between,1431.763,1.935
"campaigning and governing, that things take longer",1433.698,1.769
than he thought?,1435.467,1.234
"Mr. Spicer: No, I think there&amp;#39;s a difference.",1436.701,1.001
"The plan has been received, right.",1437.702,1.335
"The issue, as you correctly point out in",1439.037,2.035
"your question, is that now that it becomes an aspect",1441.072,1.836
of the principals all discussing different,1442.908,3.67
"priorities, different staffing levels,",1446.578,1.535
different funding levels.,1448.113,1.134
"But the plan is here, as we noted a few weeks ago.",1449.247,3.137
"It&amp;#39;s being reviewed, and they&amp;#39;re providing input",1452.384,3.47
from different members of the principals and,1455.854,2.202
different members of his national security,1458.056,1.235
apparatus to make sure that the plan continues to,1459.291,3.169
evolve and is able to attack ISIS in a way that --,1462.46,3.804
The Press: When is it actually going,1466.264,0.834
to take effect?,1467.098,4.338
"Mr. Spicer: Some pieces of it are, in the sense of --",1471.436,1.969
he has talked to commanders on the ground.,1473.405,2.736
We&amp;#39;ve noted before some of the military action that&amp;#39;s,1476.141,2.335
"been taken, some of the authority that&amp;#39;s been",1478.476,1.702
given to some of the commanders on the ground.,1480.178,2.636
That is actually taking the fight to ISIS,1482.814,2.136
on a daily basis.,1484.95,1.434
I think the more holistic approach that he asked for,1486.384,2.603
will continue to evolve through the national,1488.987,2.169
security process.,1491.156,1.401
"But make no mistake, we&amp;#39;re on it right now. Sharon.",1492.557,3.871
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1496.428,1.034
"On the executive order this afternoon, do you",1497.462,2.803
have a numeric goal for either reducing the size,1500.265,3.103
of government or saving a certain amount of money,1503.368,1.668
through the review of agencies?,1505.036,3.737
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know that Director Mulvaney,1508.773,2.236
"has a target, per se.",1511.009,1.969
"I think that&amp;#39;s part of the issue, is that you go",1512.978,1.868
through each one of these and you evaluate them on,1514.846,2.169
"the merit of what they do or don&amp;#39;t do, or whether or",1517.015,2.836
"not they&amp;#39;ve become bloated or duplicative, or,",1519.851,3.404
"frankly, just outdated or",1523.255,2.636
in need of technological advances.,1525.891,2.535
But there&amp;#39;s a lot of -- there&amp;#39;s no set number that,1528.426,3.604
we&amp;#39;re driving down to as we review government.,1532.03,2.603
Sometimes you just walk into an agency and you,1534.633,2.002
realize that agency&amp;#39;s mission is no longer,1536.635,1.935
"relevant, or that it&amp;#39;s duplicative in three other",1538.57,3.07
"agencies, or that there are too many people",1541.64,3.303
performing a function that no longer exists for,1544.943,2.669
a variety of reasons.,1547.612,1.368
But that&amp;#39;s why the mission is critical that Director,1548.98,2.803
Mulvaney was given the mandate to go out and get,1551.783,3.37
all of these different agencies and departments,1555.153,3.103
to review themselves and to provide feedback for,1558.256,3.137
him as to where we could go. Gabi.,1561.393,2.302
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1563.695,0.534
You had said previously that the Republican,1564.229,2.035
healthcare plan wouldn&amp;#39;t be a one-size-fits-all,1566.264,2.469
"approach, but the current plan preserves Obamacare&amp;#39;s",1568.733,4.071
"health benefits requirements, which",1572.804,2.402
literally defines insurance at the,1575.206,2.036
federal level.,1577.242,0.767
So how do you reconcile those two things?,1578.009,2.069
Mr. Spicer: What&amp;#39;s missing right now is choice.,1580.078,2.636
That&amp;#39;s the number-one issue.,1582.714,1.668
We tried to solve a problem -- when I say,1584.382,2.503
"&amp;quot;we,&amp;quot; the government -- with respect to Obamacare",1586.885,2.636
"back in 2008, 2009.",1589.521,3.403
"And the issue was, is that in order to solve a",1592.924,1.535
problem for several million people being,1594.459,2.402
"without healthcare insurance, we upended the",1596.861,1.936
system for everybody -- so if you had employer-based,1598.797,2.469
"healthcare, if you had TRICARE,",1601.266,1.702
Medicare or Medicaid.,1602.968,1.601
And it was exactly the opposite approach.,1604.569,1.769
We went in to solve a problem that a small,1606.338,3.003
"fraction of Americans had, and we upended the entire",1609.341,4.17
"system, forcing premiums to go up and choice to go",1613.511,2.403
down for everybody.,1615.914,1.468
And I think that when you can institute choice and,1617.382,2.135
"competition back in the system, that&amp;#39;s something",1619.517,1.936
that&amp;#39;s going to benefit everybody.,1621.453,1.401
And that&amp;#39;s exactly the opposite of,1622.854,1.835
what&amp;#39;s happening.,1624.689,1.068
The Press: Would phase two or three of this eliminate,1625.757,1.735
those requirements?,1627.492,1.768
"Mr. Spicer: I think phase two, the administrative",1629.26,2.203
"phase, will look at a lot of those requirements, and",1631.463,1.735
"then phase three -- and again, they&amp;#39;re not",1633.198,1.902
"necessarily -- they can run concurrently, and I",1635.1,3.036
think the House is looking at starting a lot,1638.136,1.401
of that legislation.,1639.537,1.836
And so -- and Dr. Price is already starting to look,1641.373,3.136
through a lot of that administration -- a lot of,1644.509,2.102
administrative aspects of it as well at HHS and,1646.611,3.203
"figure out how do we start to achieve some of this,",1649.814,2.67
"unravel some of these pieces that are there, but",1652.484,2.402
"instilling choice and competition, allowing",1654.886,2.87
people to buy their insurance over state,1657.756,2.502
"lines, allowing small businesses to pool,",1660.258,2.269
allowing the expansion of health savings accounts --,1662.527,2.035
all of those kind of factors that are going to,1664.562,2.036
"drive down costs, but also having the insurance",1666.598,1.768
"companies, frankly, be able to offer additional",1668.366,3.871
choices and options for people is in itself going,1672.237,3.036
to be a huge bonus. Charlie.,1675.273,3.003
The Press: A lot of conservatives are,1678.276,1.401
complaining that -- or suggesting that the,1679.677,2.67
President doesn&amp;#39;t fully back the Paul Ryan,1682.347,2.703
healthcare plan.,1685.05,1.701
Has the President spoken with Paul Ryan,1686.751,1.735
about the plan?,1688.486,1.101
And have they had any conversations about its,1689.587,2.236
future in Congress?,1691.823,3.136
"Mr. Spicer: They have spoken, yes.",1694.959,3.104
I don&amp;#39;t know when the last time they have.,1698.063,4.204
But the President is fully committed to this plan.,1702.267,2.035
I think you saw Secretary Price and Director,1704.302,2.336
Mulvaney out discussing that this weekend.,1706.638,2.502
They&amp;#39;re committed to the plan.,1709.14,2.202
"And, look, Director Mulvaney made it very",1711.342,2.069
clear this weekend as well that if through the,1713.411,1.802
process we can find some ideas that make this a,1715.213,4.037
"stronger, more patient-centered piece of",1719.25,2.303
legislation that will ultimately benefit,1721.553,2.402
"Americans, then we&amp;#39;re going to do it.",1723.955,1.835
We&amp;#39;re not saying this is the only way forward.,1725.79,5.272
As it works its way through the House and then,1731.062,2.136
"ultimately through the Senate, if there are ways",1733.198,2.168
that we can enhance the bill through the,1735.366,2.069
"legislative process, we&amp;#39;re willing to do that. Peter.",1737.435,2.503
The Press: You want to read us another -- quickly,1739.938,4.404
-- if there&amp;#39;s any details of the --,1744.342,0.367
Mr. Spicer: Would you like to know?,1744.709,0.701
(Laughter.),1745.41,0.434
The Press: Yes.,1745.844,0.533
"Mr. Spicer: Okay, thank you.",1746.377,0.601
The President spoke to the Chancellor of Germany.,1746.978,1.668
"They agreed, due to the current weather, that the",1748.646,1.602
meeting should be postponed.,1750.248,3.203
"The meeting has been rescheduled to March 17th,",1753.451,1.735
this Friday.,1755.186,1.268
Same schedule of events on March 17th.,1756.454,2.269
"The Press: All right, I&amp;#39;ll ask my question if I can",1758.723,1.135
very quickly then.,1759.858,0.934
Mr. Spicer: Thank you for your assistance with the --,1760.792,1.768
The Press: That&amp;#39;s news.,1762.56,2.303
"You spoke on behalf of the President, quoting him on",1764.863,1.968
the jobs report on Friday.,1766.831,1.135
"You said they &amp;quot;may have been phony in the past,",1767.966,1.801
but it&amp;#39;s very real now.&amp;quot;,1769.767,1.736
Mr. Spicer: They are very real now.,1771.503,1.701
The Press: &amp;quot;They are very real now.&amp;quot; Mr. Spicer:,1773.204,2.503
Just want to make sure you get it right.,1775.707,0.434
The Press: The question I wanted -- when should,1776.141,0.967
Americans trust the President?,1777.108,0.601
Should they trust the President -- is it phony,1777.709,1.401
or real when he says that President Obama,1779.11,1.835
was wiretapping him?,1780.945,1.135
"Mr. Spicer: Well, again, let&amp;#39;s get back.",1782.08,1.568
I think there&amp;#39;s two things that are important,1783.648,1.168
about what he said.,1784.816,1.268
I think recognizing that it&amp;#39;s -- he doesn&amp;#39;t really,1786.084,2.202
think that President Obama went up and tapped his,1788.286,2.302
phone personally.,1790.588,1.302
The Press: What does he think?,1791.89,0.533
Mr. Spicer: But I think there&amp;#39;s no question that,1792.423,2.303
"the Obama administration, that there were actions",1794.726,2.436
about surveillance and other activities that,1797.162,1.768
occurred in the 2016 election.,1798.93,1.635
That is a widely reported activity that,1800.565,3.704
occurred back then.,1804.269,1.301
"The President used the word &amp;quot;wiretap&amp;quot; to mean,",1805.57,2.97
"broadly, surveillance and",1808.54,2.168
other activities during that.,1810.708,1.502
"And that is, again, something -- it is",1812.21,1.268
interesting how many news outlets reported that this,1813.478,2.736
activity was taking place during the 2016 election,1816.214,3.103
"cycle, and now we&amp;#39;re",1819.317,1.468
wondering where the proof is.,1820.785,1.168
It is many of the same outlets in this room that,1821.953,2.903
talked about the activities that were going,1824.856,1.535
on back then.,1826.391,1.101
"The Press: So on the same topic, on the CBO report,",1827.492,2.169
"did the President think it was real then,",1829.661,2.369
and is phony now?,1832.03,1.368
Mr. Spicer: What CBO report?,1833.398,0.901
The Press: On the expectation -- the CBO,1834.299,1.835
"report is coming out, about which you said, &amp;quot;If",1836.134,2.369
"you&amp;#39;re looking at the CBO for accuracy, you&amp;#39;re",1838.503,1.635
looking in the wrong place.&amp;quot;,1840.138,1.168
"Three years ago, you said of the CBO report, that it",1841.306,2.335
confirms Obamacare is bad for the economy.,1843.641,2.269
So the question is --,1845.91,0.634
"Mr. Spicer: Well, it was bad for the economy.",1846.544,1.068
"The Press: Okay, so the bottom line of the",1847.612,1.134
"question is, was it real then, and now",1848.746,1.769
is now phony?,1850.515,0.567
"As you have said, it&amp;#39;s not the place",1851.082,1.068
to find accuracy?,1852.15,1.234
"Mr. Spicer: Okay, so let&amp;#39;s look at",1853.384,1.001
the CBO&amp;#39;s projection.,1854.385,1.368
"It said their projection on Obamacare was that, in",1855.753,2.436
"2016, it would have 24 million people on it.",1858.189,3.237
The actual figure is 10.4 million people -- less,1861.426,3.036
than half the number of people that it predicted,1864.462,3.47
"would be insured were on it, and it&amp;#39;s declining.",1867.932,2.97
"So the only point, Peter, is to make sure that",1870.902,1.902
people understand -- if you&amp;#39;re looking to get a,1872.804,2.436
bullseye accurate prediction as to where,1875.24,2.669
"it&amp;#39;s going, the CBO was off by more than",1877.909,1.935
half last time.,1879.844,1.668
So it&amp;#39;s not -- this is not about what my,1881.512,2.103
understanding or my belief of the CBO is.,1883.615,2.502
"The last time they did this they were wildly off,",1886.117,2.669
and the number keeps declining.,1888.786,2.369
And so the question that needs to get asked right,1891.155,1.902
"now, or, frankly, the awareness that needs to be",1893.057,2.102
brought up right now is that if you were going to,1895.159,1.769
"look at a number tonight, I think you have to look",1896.928,1.635
through the scope of,1898.563,1.468
whether or not that number is.,1900.031,1.602
"Now, it was bad for the economy.",1901.633,1.901
That was right.,1903.534,0.901
You can glean that in terms of the direction,1904.435,2.57
what the impact that it had.,1907.005,1.501
But as far as their numbers go -- on the,1908.506,1.902
number of people that they predicted back then would,1910.408,3.37
be covered now -- they were off by more than half.,1913.778,2.336
"The Press: I guess the question is, when can we",1916.114,1.001
trust the President when he says something is phony,1917.115,1.568
and when he says it&amp;#39;s real?,1918.683,0.601
"Mr. Spicer: Hold on, hold on.",1919.284,0.5
"You asked a question about CBO, and now you&amp;#39;re",1919.784,1.935
conflating it with the question of the President.,1921.719,1.769
The question is --,1923.488,0.934
"The Press: No, I asked a question about wiretapping",1924.422,1.201
first. And then we went on to CBO.,1925.623,1.635
"So the question, in simple terms is, when he says",1927.258,1.702
"something, can we trust that it&amp;#39;s real --",1928.96,3.537
Mr. Spicer: Yes.,1932.497,0.467
The Press: -- or should we assume that it&amp;#39;s phony?,1932.964,1.001
"Well, no, no -- Mr. Spicer: You suggest",1933.965,1.368
"that it&amp;#39;s real, absolutely.",1935.333,0.734
The Press: How can we believe that it&amp;#39;s real,1936.067,0.434
"when you just told us that it was phony then,",1936.501,1.101
but now it&amp;#39;s real?,1937.602,1.034
"Mr. Spicer: I did not tell you that, Peter.",1938.636,0.734
And you&amp;#39;re trying --,1939.37,0.768
The Press: You told us on,1940.138,0.7
"Friday that the President said -- the President, you",1940.838,1.202
didn&amp;#39;t -- the President said the numbers were,1942.04,1.801
phony then but they&amp;#39;re very real now.,1943.841,2.636
So how can we take anything he says that he,1946.477,1.769
"won&amp;#39;t later say, &amp;quot;actually it was the opposite&amp;quot;?",1948.246,2.402
"Mr. Spicer: Hold on, hold on.",1950.648,0.801
"I think the difference is, the President was talking",1951.449,1.535
then and now about job creation --,1952.984,2.369
the number of jobs.,1955.353,1.068
The issue that he brought up in the quote that,1956.421,2.068
you&amp;#39;re talking about was the percentage of people,1958.489,1.969
who are unemployed.,1960.458,1.034
And there is no question that no matter how you,1961.492,2.469
"look at this, whether you talk about 4.7 or 4.8 or",1963.961,3.037
"whatever the number is, that number fluctuates by",1966.998,3.37
how people calculate who is in the workforce.,1970.368,2.135
The Press: He said it was in the twenties or more.,1972.503,1.435
"Mr. Spicer: Okay, Peter,",1973.938,0.467
let me answer the question.,1974.405,0.601
The Press: I&amp;#39;m listening.,1975.006,0.567
Mr. Spicer: You&amp;#39;re not.,1975.573,0.434
Let me answer it.,1976.007,1.201
"The bottom line is, the percentage of people who",1977.208,1.401
are unemployed varies widely by who you&amp;#39;re,1978.609,2.737
asking and the way you do the analysis of who is,1981.346,2.535
actually in the workforce.,1983.881,1.569
The number of people who are working and receiving,1985.45,1.835
a paycheck is a number that we can look at.,1987.285,2.569
"Secondly, when you&amp;#39;re asking about the validity",1989.854,2.503
"of the CBO report, again, I would refer you",1992.357,1.868
to the CBO itself.,1994.225,1.568
The number that they issued that would be,1995.793,1.569
insured in 2016 was 26 million people.,1997.362,3.436
"The actual number is 10 -- excuse me, 24 million.",2000.798,3.604
The actual number is 10.4.,2004.402,0.534
That&amp;#39;s not a question of our credibility.,2004.936,1.568
It&amp;#39;s a question of theirs.,2006.504,0.934
Do you have anything more?,2007.438,2.236
(Laughter.),2009.674,0.967
"The Press: The bottom line is, the question that you still have",2010.641,1.268
not answered is --,2011.909,0.501
Mr. Spicer: I have answered it.,2012.41,0.567
The Press: -- can you say affirmatively that,2012.977,1.168
"whenever the President says something, we can",2014.145,1.835
trust it to be real?,2015.98,1.468
"Mr. Spicer: If he&amp;#39;s not joking, of course.",2017.448,2.503
But in that case --,2019.951,0.901
The Press: So let&amp;#39;s start over again with joking.,2020.852,3.77
Mr. Spicer: But you&amp;#39;re asking -- hold on --,2024.622,0.701
"okay, no, no.",2025.323,0.367
"But your point is -- I mean, every time that he",2025.69,1.835
speaks authoritatively -- that he speaks -- that he,2027.525,1.902
is speaking as President of the United States.,2029.427,2.202
Like it&amp;#39;s --,2031.629,0.501
The Press: Three to five -- more than 3 million,2032.13,1.501
"Americans voted illegally -- was that,",2033.631,0.901
when he was speaking --,2034.532,0.601
Mr. Spicer: Yes. And he still believes that.,2035.133,0.6
The Press: -- was he joking or does,2035.733,0.467
he believe it?,2036.2,0.401
Mr. Spicer: He does believe it.,2036.601,1.201
Thank you. Julie.,2037.802,1.168
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",2038.97,0.667
I have a healthcare question.,2039.637,1.268
"But first, can we just get an answer one way or the",2040.905,1.702
other about whether the President directed the,2042.607,1.735
Department of Justice to respond to this?,2044.342,2.569
"Mr. Spicer: No, he did not.",2046.911,0.701
The Press: And does he plan to?,2047.612,1.501
Mr. Spicer: I answered the question.,2049.113,0.934
"The Press: Okay, so on healthcare, Secretary",2050.047,2.37
Price said on Sunday that nobody will be worse off,2052.417,2.335
financially and more people will be covered,2054.752,1.769
than are currently with the plan that you,2056.521,2.235
guys are pushing.,2058.756,2.036
Paul Ryan acknowledged that people are going,2060.792,1.368
to lose coverage.,2062.16,1.268
So what is the goal here?,2063.428,1.568
You just said you&amp;#39;re open to modifications to the,2064.996,2.235
plan if you find that there&amp;#39;s a better,2067.231,1.602
way to do it.,2068.833,0.534
Is the goal that people not lose coverage?,2069.367,2.369
Or is the goal that --,2071.736,0.901
"Mr. Spicer: Well, again --",2072.637,0.467
but there&amp;#39;s a false argument there which is,2073.104,2.202
that they have coverage.,2075.306,1.902
"People have cards, they&amp;#39;ve been told they have",2077.208,2.202
"things, but they can&amp;#39;t -- they keep walking in --",2079.41,1.735
the President met with nine individuals this,2081.145,1.635
morning that they were told they&amp;#39;re going to get,2082.78,2.536
"coverage for something, they are told that they&amp;#39;re",2085.316,2.102
going to have all these subsidies.,2087.418,1.568
"They walk in, and they don&amp;#39;t get covered.",2088.986,1.602
They don&amp;#39;t have the care that they need.,2090.588,1.201
There is a difference between walking around,2091.789,1.702
"with someone and saying, hey, I&amp;#39;ve got a card,",2093.491,1.802
than I have care.,2095.293,1.368
"And that is a big, big difference.",2096.661,1.034
"Right now, when you have a third of the counties in",2097.695,2.97
"this country that have one choice and going down, and",2100.665,3.537
"number of insurers leaving markets, then the",2104.202,3.737
system is collapsing.,2107.939,3.737
"So the question has to be, to everybody who is not",2111.676,1.768
"with us on this, is what is your alternative?",2113.444,2.636
"Because right now, the current system of",2116.08,1.702
Obamacare is failing every American,2117.782,2.235
who has Obamacare.,2120.017,1.936
"And frankly, for those who don&amp;#39;t have Obamacare, for",2121.953,2.102
"those who have employer-based insurance,",2124.055,1.535
"for those who have TRICARE or Medicare, it&amp;#39;s driving",2125.59,2.702
up the costs.,2128.292,1.435
"And in the cases, especially for those who",2129.727,1.335
"have Medicaid, Medicare, or TRICEARE, they&amp;#39;re going",2131.062,1.935
into doctors&amp;#39; offices more and more who are telling,2132.997,2.336
"them, we don&amp;#39;t accept that.",2135.333,1.334
The Press: But you&amp;#39;re talking about quality,2136.667,1.969
and about cost.,2138.636,0.634
I&amp;#39;m asking about coverage.,2139.27,1.368
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, but that&amp;#39;s the point, is that",2140.638,1.468
you&amp;#39;re missing the point.,2142.106,1.135
If you keep talking about coverage --,2143.241,1.835
care is what matters.,2145.076,1.001
"If you can&amp;#39;t walk in and get seen, if you can&amp;#39;t get",2146.077,2.869
"a doctor to see you, then you don&amp;#39;t have coverage.",2148.946,3.437
"I mean, that&amp;#39;s what this is all about.",2152.383,2.736
Being told you have coverage but you can&amp;#39;t go,2155.119,1.702
"see a doctor, or you can&amp;#39;t afford to see a doctor",2156.821,2.202
is not coverage.,2159.023,1.268
John Gizzi.,2160.291,1.268
"Mr. Spicer: Thank you, Sean.",2161.559,1.001
I have two questions.,2162.56,2.469
"First, Democratic Leader Pelosi said on Friday that",2165.029,4.171
every single Democrat would vote against the,2169.2,3.437
American healthcare plan -- the plan backed by,2172.637,3.637
Republican members of Congress and,2176.274,2.636
the administration.,2178.91,1.801
The Freedom Caucus in the House has come out for,2180.711,2.77
Senator Paul&amp;#39;s plan.,2183.481,2.169
When one simply does the arithmetic of Democratic,2185.65,2.502
"members and Freedom Caucus members, that&amp;#39;s a majority",2188.152,3.704
against the plan.,2191.856,1.768
How does the administration plan to,2193.624,2.102
overcome the arithmetic?,2195.726,2.269
Mr. Spicer: We&amp;#39;re going to continue to work with,2197.995,1.001
members of the House,2198.996,0.968
and then eventually the Senate.,2199.964,1.401
"I feel very good, as the President continues to",2201.365,1.635
"engage with members, that we will have the",2203,3.337
votes necessary.,2206.337,0.734
I think Speaker Ryan agrees with that as well.,2207.071,2.369
"We&amp;#39;re going to have the votes, this thing will",2209.44,1.135
"pass, and we&amp;#39;ll move on to the Senate.",2210.575,2.535
The Press: The other question is this: In,2213.11,1.735
recent weeks there&amp;#39;s been considerable attention on,2214.845,3.904
the upcoming elections in the Netherlands on,2218.749,2.036
"Wednesday, and in France in a few weeks.",2220.785,2.803
Candidate Geert Wilders of the Netherlands was here,2223.588,2.669
for the CPAC conference.,2226.257,2.769
Representatives of Marine,2229.026,1.535
Le Pen of France were here.,2230.561,2.002
Many analogies were made between these candidates,2232.563,3.37
"and President Trump, and they offered words of",2235.933,2.503
praise for him or did so through,2238.436,2.235
their representatives.,2240.671,1.468
Is he aware of these candidates in Europe who,2242.139,4.004
invoke his name and image?,2246.143,1.836
"And if so, what does he think of these would-be",2247.979,3.803
Trumps and Trumpettes?,2251.782,1.335
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know the answer to that.,2253.117,1.568
I think most of these are -- we&amp;#39;ll allow sovereign,2254.685,2.736
nations to have their own elections,2257.421,1.402
without interference. Alexis.,2258.823,1.768
"The Press: Sean, can I follow up on Peter and",2260.591,2.169
Julie&amp;#39;s questions?,2262.76,1.702
Mr. Spicer: Sure.,2264.462,1.134
"The Press: Two issues, again.",2265.596,1.769
Whether the President and Director Mulvaney put a,2267.365,3.57
lot of faith in the Congressional Budget,2270.935,2.335
"Office, members of the Senate will, when they get",2273.27,2.536
-- if they get legislation from the House.,2275.806,3.871
"So my question is, what does the President or the",2279.677,2.502
administration intend to do to establish to,2282.179,4.405
senators&amp;#39; satisfaction that the numbers coming,2286.584,3.003
"out of the Congressional Budget Office, which the",2289.587,2.869
"President will question, are not substantial and",2292.456,3.837
can be countered by other information?,2296.293,2.803
"In other words, is OMB doing its own",2299.096,0.1
kind of score?,2299.196,2.169
Is the President relying on a think tank to,2301.365,2.369
counter the messaging?,2303.734,1.268
Because senators are already indicating that,2305.002,2.536
they will put weight in the CBO&amp;#39;s score.,2307.538,2.536
"Mr. Spicer: And again, I think this is part of an",2310.074,2.035
ongoing discussion with members as far as,2312.109,1.602
"philosophical, what do they believe, and a lot of",2313.711,3.303
these aspects of this plan in keeping with what they,2317.014,2.403
have supported in the past.,2319.417,3.503
"Obviously, they&amp;#39;re going to look at the score --",2322.92,0.934
I get it.,2323.854,0.768
That&amp;#39;s part of it.,2324.622,1.334
And there are pieces of it that may historically have,2325.956,2.203
more weighted than others.,2328.159,1.902
But I think this is going to be -- as I mentioned to,2330.061,1.434
"John, I mean, it&amp;#39;s an ongoing conversation with",2331.495,2.369
members of the House and ultimately the Senate with,2333.864,1.135
respect to whatever comes out.,2334.999,2.536
But in the same way that members relied on the,2337.535,1.868
"score last time, they were way off.",2339.403,2.736
And I think that we have to remind them that if,2342.139,1.635
"this is what you&amp;#39;re basing your vote on, you have to",2343.774,3.47
look at the historical context in which that,2347.244,3.337
information was provided.,2350.581,2.436
I think that&amp;#39;s an important aspect to,2353.017,2.035
how they do it.,2355.052,0.934
But I think there&amp;#39;s going to be a ton of factors,2355.986,1.068
that people rely on as they do this.,2357.054,3.904
The Press: Can I follow -- I have one follow-up.,2360.958,1.235
Mr. Spicer: Of course.,2362.193,0.534
The Press: I may be confused about the,2362.727,3.236
"wiretapping, your answers, in terms of",2365.963,1.368
the President&amp;#39;s response.,2367.331,2.336
"The President was the one who tweeted this, right,",2369.667,2.569
and said that he learned something.,2372.236,2.269
"So can you just establish for me, because I&amp;#39;m",2374.505,1.835
"confused, the President did discuss what it is",2376.34,4.204
"that he had in mind, what he tweeted, with the",2380.544,2.069
Department of Justice before the Department 00,2382.613,2.469
"Mr. Spicer: No, I&amp;#39;m not going to get into what the",2385.082,1.368
President knew or didn&amp;#39;t know prior to it.,2386.45,2.136
I think we&amp;#39;ve already commented on this,2388.586,1.935
multiple times.,2390.521,1.134
The Press: But how would the Department of Justice,2391.655,1.502
have any idea --,2393.157,0.934
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know.,2394.091,0.567
This was a request made of the House Intelligence,2394.658,1.602
"Committee, not to us.",2396.26,1.401
So I don&amp;#39;t want to get into starting to parse,2397.661,2.103
what we knew or what we didn&amp;#39;t.,2399.764,1.368
"That request did not come to us, it went to the",2401.132,1.835
Department of Justice. Yes.,2402.967,1.101
The Press: Congressman Steve King (inaudible) a,2404.068,4.237
"tweet he put up, saying that, &amp;quot;We can&amp;#39;t restore",2408.305,2.436
civilization with somebody else&amp;#39;s babies.&amp;quot; Does the,2410.741,2.603
White House have any reaction to that?,2413.344,1.301
Mr. Spicer: I will definitely touch base with,2414.645,1.268
the President on that and get back to you on that.,2415.913,1.435
Hallie.,2417.348,0.834
"The Press: Sean, two for you.",2418.182,0.634
I just want to go back to something.,2418.816,1.168
You just said a minute ago that &amp;quot;what the President,2419.984,1.568
meant when he tweeted about the wiretapping was&amp;quot;,2421.552,2.869
-- and you sort of explained it.,2424.421,1.402
But you&amp;#39;ve also stood at that podium and said the,2425.823,1.601
tweet speaks for itself.,2427.424,1.502
"When do you decide when a President&amp;#39;s tweets, when",2428.926,1.668
his words are open to interpretation and when,2430.594,3.404
those words stand on their own?,2433.998,1.968
"Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sorry, can you further explain",2435.966,2.303
what you&amp;#39;re asking?,2438.269,1.101
"I mean, his tweets do speak for themselves.",2439.37,1.668
The Press: You just sort of interpreted it for,2441.038,1.335
"Peter, saying, well, he didn&amp;#39;t mean that President",2442.373,1.501
Obama had --,2443.874,0.534
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s not what I said.,2444.408,0.934
"No, no, actually --",2445.342,0.801
The Press: You said when he,2446.143,0.601
meant wiretapping -- said it --,2446.744,1.902
he meant surveillance.,2448.646,1.368
That&amp;#39;s not what he said.,2450.014,1.134
Mr. Spicer: He literally had it in quotes.,2451.148,1.402
The Press: So you&amp;#39;re interpreting the tweet for,2452.55,0.934
"us, it sounds like.",2453.484,1.001
"Mr. Spicer: No, in some cases I&amp;#39;ll ask him, what",2454.485,1.234
"did the quotes mean, and he&amp;#39;ll say -- The Press:",2455.719,1.902
Did you ask about this tweet?,2457.621,0.935
Mr. Spicer: I did.,2458.556,0.567
The Press: And what did he say?,2459.123,0.5
"Mr. Spicer: He said they were in quotes, I was",2459.623,0.668
referring to surveillance overall.,2460.291,1.101
It&amp;#39;s something that had been referred to,2461.392,1.835
in other reports.,2463.227,2.469
The Press: So he cited other reports in his,2465.696,1.268
conversation with you?,2466.964,0.734
"Mr. Spicer: He did, yes.",2467.698,0.667
The Press: So was that what he was basing,2468.365,0.768
that tweet on?,2469.133,0.567
Mr. Spicer: As I just mentioned -- it was a good,2469.7,1.668
"try, but I&amp;#39;ve already been clear on that.",2471.368,2.036
"The Press: I have a second for you, Sean.",2473.404,0.901
I want to go back to this healthcare idea.,2474.305,6.54
"Just yes or no: Are CBO numbers legitimate,",2480.845,0.567
or not?,2481.412,1.034
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s not my determination to make.,2482.446,1.502
I&amp;#39;m telling -- The Press: Does the President think,2483.948,2.402
those numbers are legitimate?,2486.35,0.901
"Mr. Spicer: Hallie, it depends.",2487.251,0.567
"There are a lot of things at -- hold on, Hallie.",2487.818,1.969
You guys have like an NBC thing.,2489.787,2.169
Let me answer the question.,2491.956,3.937
"I think when you look at whatever that number is,",2495.893,2.002
"whether it&amp;#39;s budget projections or whatever, I",2497.895,1.802
think there&amp;#39;s a track record that goes along a,2499.697,2.235
lot of times with whether or not the projections in,2501.932,2.269
"certain areas -- whether it&amp;#39;s unemployment,",2504.201,1.335
"budgetary numbers, whatever -- what",2505.536,2.569
the track record is.,2508.105,0.834
All I&amp;#39;m suggesting to you is very clearly that the,2508.939,2.569
numbers that they gave the last time they did health,2511.508,1.969
care were off by more than 50 percent when it came to,2513.477,2.503
the number of people insured.,2515.98,1.034
"That&amp;#39;s not my interpretation,",2517.014,1.468
that&amp;#39;s a fact.,2518.482,1.068
And I think it&amp;#39;s important for people to understand,2519.55,1.635
the differences. Eamon.,2521.185,2.436
"The Press: Sean, on Preet Bharara, I guess there are",2523.621,1.501
two possibilities here.,2525.122,1.502
One is the President made a commitment to keep him,2526.624,2.002
"back in November, and the other one is",2528.626,1.434
that he didn&amp;#39;t.,2530.06,1.335
Preet Bharara came down to the lobby of Trump Tower,2531.395,1.935
and said that the President had,2533.33,0.868
made that commitment.,2534.198,1.201
"Did the President, in fact, make that",2535.399,1.502
commitment to Preet Bharara?,2536.901,1.468
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t think it really matters.,2538.369,1.501
"At the end of the day, the Attorney General followed",2539.87,1.668
a practice that existed for the last several,2541.538,2.236
administrations and asked every attorney general in,2543.774,2.569
the last administration to submit their resignation.,2546.343,2.703
"So, I mean, it is --",2549.046,1.401
The Press: It matters in,2550.447,0.434
"ongoing investigations, and it also matters in the",2550.881,1.068
sense that the President made a commitment.,2551.949,1.868
"If he made a commitment, why did he",2553.817,1.402
change his mind?,2555.219,0.934
Why did he go back on it?,2556.153,1.101
"Mr. Spicer: Well, again, as I mentioned earlier, he",2557.254,1.435
called him to thank him for his service last week.,2558.689,2.135
He followed in the past practice of last several,2560.824,2.97
administration and asked everybody to step down.,2563.794,3.103
And I think that&amp;#39;s the appropriate thing.,2566.897,1.201
"The Press: Sean, but what&amp;#39;s changed from",2568.098,1.135
November to now?,2569.233,1.368
Mr. Spicer: I called on someone.,2570.601,1.468
"The Press: Sean, thank you.",2572.069,0.567
"Ronica Cleary from Fox 5, thank you.",2572.636,2.202
I have two questions.,2574.838,1.268
"The first, I think especially in light of",2576.106,3.17
"what has happened in the room here today, the",2579.276,1.669
President tweeted this morning that much of the,2580.945,2.502
media is being rude and that we should be nice.,2583.447,3.57
"So my question is, is it our job to be nice?",2587.017,2.87
And do you think we&amp;#39;re nice?,2589.887,1.401
(Laughter.),2591.288,1.101
"Mr. Spicer: Thank you, Ronica.",2592.389,2.102
I will just leave it at this.,2594.491,1.168
I think that I&amp;#39;ve been asked for my personal,2595.659,1.268
opinion several times.,2596.927,1.201
That&amp;#39;s not my job.,2598.128,1.302
I don&amp;#39;t get up here to speak for myself.,2599.43,2.502
I speak for the President.,2601.932,2.403
I think that he has been very clear that he doesn&amp;#39;t,2604.335,1.801
believe some of the behavior and the reporting,2606.136,2.503
has been appropriate.,2608.639,2.736
"And to Hallie&amp;#39;s point, I will let the tweet speak",2611.375,3.203
for itself.,2614.578,1.435
"Ronica, number two.",2616.013,0.834
The Press: Second question.,2616.847,0.467
But this is about you.,2617.314,3.137
The interaction you had at the Apple store this,2620.451,1.501
"weekend -- what would be, I guess, your message to",2621.952,3.504
individuals who want to maybe -- I see that woman,2625.456,3.97
"was, you could argue, very aggressive.",2629.426,1.735
If somebody doesn&amp;#39;t want to be aggressive and has a,2631.161,2.136
"question for you, what would you be your kind of",2633.297,2.035
message to a regular citizen that has an issue?,2635.332,3.504
Mr. Spicer: Ask it.,2638.836,1.268
I interact with individuals all day long.,2640.104,3.303
"Ninety-nine percent of them are pleasant, even",2643.407,2.169
with people who may not agree with our philosophy,2645.576,4.838
or programs or whatever.,2650.414,2.235
"But it&amp;#39;s a free country, and the beauty of it is",2652.649,1.869
"that people can act how they want, no matter how",2654.518,2.669
that&amp;#39;s interpreted.,2657.187,0.901
And as long as they stay on the right side of the,2658.088,2.569
"First Amendment, we&amp;#39;re good. Francesca.",2660.657,1.869
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",2662.526,2.202
You said that when the President said wiretapping,2664.728,3.337
in that tweet he meant a whole host of,2668.065,2.536
surveillance types.,2670.601,1.101
"So that we can be crystal clear, what surveillance",2671.702,2.269
types was he referring to then?,2673.971,2.636
What would you consider part of that range?,2676.607,2.402
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I mean, I think there&amp;#39;s a whole",2679.009,4.505
host of tactics that can be used to monitor,2683.514,2.302
somebody -- either through wiretap or other ways in,2685.816,3.103
which you can surveil somebody.,2688.919,3.137
"The Press: We took that to mean monitoring his calls,",2692.056,1.968
specifically.,2694.024,0.701
So what else would you include in that range?,2694.725,1.935
Mr. Spicer: I think there&amp;#39;s a whole host of,2696.66,1.168
things that fall into that category.,2697.828,2.269
"So I&amp;#39;m not sure how you took it, but there is a",2700.097,1.702
wide range of ways in which somebody can be,2701.799,2.969
monitored or followed up on.,2704.768,2.369
And I think that if you contacted one of the law,2707.137,2.736
"enforcement agencies, they will provide you with a",2709.873,2.67
whole host of ways.,2712.543,1.234
"Thank you, all.",2713.777,0.634
Be safe tomorrow with the snow.,2714.411,1.802
Thank you very much.,2716.213,0.901
Take care.,2717.114,0.901
Stay safe.,2718.015,0.434
