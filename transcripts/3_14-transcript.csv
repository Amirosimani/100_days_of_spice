Mr. Spicer: Looks like the snow didn&amp;#39;t,1.034,0.734
keep anyone away.,1.768,1.635
Good afternoon.,3.403,0.5
I hope -- I&amp;#39;m glad to see everyone made,5.004,3.437
it safely in.,8.441,1.435
"As you may have seen last night, the President met",9.876,2.135
with D.C. Mayor Bowser and Metro general manager,12.011,3.871
Wiedefeld about the preparations,15.882,1.668
for the storm.,17.55,0.668
The President continues to closely monitor the impact,18.218,2.903
of the storm throughout the Northeast.,21.121,1.901
The White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs,23.022,1.936
has been in touch with state and local officials,24.958,2.436
in the path of the storm to provide them,27.394,1.701
guidance and support.,29.095,1.535
"As the storm continues to track the East Coast,",30.63,2.503
"heavy to intense snow, sleet, and strong winds",33.133,3.003
could result in significant travel impacts,36.136,1.935
and possible coastal flooding.,38.071,2.602
"Again, the President encourages everyone to",40.673,1.602
listen to their state and local leaders and public,42.275,2.469
"safety officers, and follow their warnings and",44.744,2.136
closure notices.,46.88,0.8
They are working around the clock to ensure the,47.68,3.938
safety of our citizens and their families.,51.618,3.136
"In light of the storm, the schedule for today",54.754,1.969
changed a bit.,56.723,1.101
"Obviously, German Chancellor Merkel&amp;#39;s visit",57.824,2.035
was moved to Friday.,59.859,1.335
We&amp;#39;ll continue to provide you updates on the,61.194,2.302
schedule as we grow closer to Friday.,63.496,3.203
"Today, the President had lunch with the Deputy",66.699,1.736
Crown Prince and Minister of Defense of the Kingdom,68.435,2.635
of Saudi Arabia.,71.07,1.369
"This afternoon, the President will swear in",72.439,1.568
Seema Verma as the Administrator of Centers,74.007,2.068
for Medicare and Medicaid Services.,76.075,2.67
The President looks forward to having the,78.745,1.635
spectacularly qualified and experienced,80.38,2.502
"Administrator Verma finally onboard,",82.882,2.403
especially as we continue to lay the groundwork for,85.285,2.269
historic reform of our healthcare system.,87.554,2.869
"Later this afternoon, the President and Secretary of",90.423,2.403
"Health and Human Services, Dr. Tom Price, will have a",92.826,2.802
"call with the CEO of Anthem Healthcare,",95.628,2.837
Mr. Joseph Swedish.,98.465,1.634
He will then have a phone call with Speaker Ryan and,100.099,1.902
Majority Leader McCarthy to further discuss the,102.001,3.003
Republican plan to repeal and replace Obamacare with,105.004,3.27
the American Health Care Act and a series of,108.274,2.336
much-needed regulatory reforms to accompany that.,110.61,4.004
The President was glad to see the National,114.614,1.535
Federation of Independent Businesses announce their,116.149,2.336
"support for the American Health Care Act, and FIB",118.485,2.569
has previously identified healthcare along with,121.054,2.502
small business taxes as their two biggest,123.556,2.202
"priorities, and the President&amp;#39;s healthcare",125.758,2.103
agenda will address many of their concerns for,127.861,2.535
small businesses.,130.396,1.535
"Yesterday, of course, the Congressional Budget",131.931,2.303
Office released their report on the American,134.234,1.735
Health Care Act.,135.969,1.067
I know that there have been significant concerns,137.036,1.936
"about the CBO report, and I want to give a little",138.972,2.302
bit of context to the numbers that have,141.274,2.102
been going around.,143.376,1.268
"In 2013, the CBO estimated that 24 million people",144.644,3.77
would have coverage under Obamacare in 2016.,148.414,2.97
They were way off.,151.384,0.934
They were off by 13 million people --,152.318,2.603
over 50 percent.,154.921,1.234
"In fact, only 10.4 million people were actually",156.155,2.47
covered.,158.625,0.834
Reports now suggest that that number has dwindled,159.459,1.868
down to 9 million.,161.327,1.569
"CBO coverage estimates are consistently wrong and,",162.896,3.003
"more importantly, did not take into consideration",165.899,2.569
the comprehensive nature of the three-pronged plan,168.468,3.17
to repeal and replace Obamacare with the,171.638,1.868
American Health Care Act.,173.506,1.502
We&amp;#39;re working to bring real relief and better,175.008,1.935
choices to the American family.,176.943,2.302
The two other prongs of our plan contain several,179.245,2.569
additional reforms that will further drive down,181.814,1.936
cost and increase coverage.,183.75,2.235
"When you get down to it, the Congressional Budget",185.985,2.169
Office is there to measure the potential impact of,188.154,2.002
programs on the federal budget.,190.156,1.635
Its attempts to estimate coverage have been,191.791,1.902
historically faulty.,193.693,1.735
But in the portion of its analysis that focuses on,195.428,2.102
"what the office is really about, the CBO concedes",197.53,2.636
that the American Health Care Act would actually,200.166,1.568
reduce the deficit by over $330 billion and bring,201.734,4.138
"health insurance premiums down 10 percent, even",205.872,3.003
before many of the significant reforms in,208.875,2.002
prongs two and three have taken effect.,210.877,1.334
"And as I&amp;#39;ve mentioned before, some of these",212.211,1.335
include expanding healthcare savings,213.546,1.335
"accounts, streamlining the process at FDA so that",214.881,1.334
innovative and lower-cost medicines can get to,216.215,1.335
"patients faster, allowing health insurance to be",217.55,1.335
"sold across state lines, which increases",218.885,5.005
"competition and decreases cost, permitting small",228.728,3.837
businesses to band together to negotiate,232.565,1.702
"healthcare rates for all of their employees, and",234.267,2.803
reforming the medical malpractice system so that,237.07,2.068
doctors aren&amp;#39;t spending their time and patients&amp;#39;,239.138,2.403
money on unnecessary procedures.,241.541,2.335
"Beyond the numbers, let&amp;#39;s talk about some real-life",243.876,2.269
examples of the cost of Obamacare for some actual,246.145,2.803
Americans who the President heard from,248.948,2.102
during his listening session yesterday.,251.05,2.703
"Kim Sertich, a small-business owner in",253.753,2.269
"Arizona, had her healthcare cost skyrocket",256.022,2.736
from $389.79 a month to $809.15.,258.758,6.573
"Carrie Couey from Colorado, a mother of six",265.331,2.703
"whose youngest son is autistic, saw her family&amp;#39;s",268.034,2.636
"yearly insurance go from $1,700* [$17,000] to",270.67,2.736
"$52,000 for a lower-quality plan.",273.406,5.572
"And Joel Brown, a farmer from Tennessee, saw his",278.978,2.903
catastrophic coverage cost spike in the wake of,281.881,2.302
Obamacare from $119 a month to more than,284.183,3.537
$500 per month.,287.72,2.636
These are the stories that really matter to millions,290.356,1.902
"of Americans who are suffering under Obamacare,",292.258,2.536
and these are the stories that are at the top of the,294.794,1.635
President&amp;#39;s mind as he works towards reforming,296.429,2.569
our healthcare system.,298.998,1.468
The President is committed to working together with,300.466,1.602
"Speaker Ryan, Majority Leader McCarthy, and",302.068,2.402
Majority Leader McConnell to create a system that&amp;#39;s,304.47,2.069
affordable and accessible to all Americans.,306.539,2.636
Let me walk through the rest of the,309.175,1.635
schedule for the week.,310.81,1.468
"Tomorrow, the President is headed to Michigan to meet",312.278,1.835
"with auto executives and workers, and will discuss",314.113,2.436
how his plans for rolling back federal red tape will,316.549,2.703
"lead to more American jobs and higher wages,",319.252,3.103
specifically in the automobile sector.,322.355,2.969
It&amp;#39;s a great opportunity for the President to,325.324,1.936
showcase moves he&amp;#39;s already made towards these,327.26,2.335
"ambitious &amp;quot;Buy American, Hire American&amp;quot; agenda,",329.595,3.237
like encouraging investment and workforce,332.832,2.102
training and developments so that Americans are,334.934,2.169
"ready for the jobs of the future, and removing the",337.103,2.502
roadblocks that prevent American businesses from,339.605,2.369
staying and expanding here in the United States.,341.974,2.636
The President hopes to build on the great,344.61,2.269
optimism that he&amp;#39;s built within the business,346.879,2.002
community in anticipation of the renewed,348.881,2.203
opportunities the President&amp;#39;s economic,351.084,1.601
agenda has already created.,352.685,2.269
He and his team are hard at work to produce the,354.954,2.035
results that the American people deserve and voted,356.989,2.97
for last year.,359.959,1.034
"He will also travel to Nashville, Tennessee,",360.993,2.203
where he will lay a wreath at President Andrew,363.196,2.269
Jackson&amp;#39;s tomb on his 250th birthday.,365.465,3.103
"Thursday, the Taoiseach of Ireland Kenny will come to",368.568,3.737
the White House for the traditional St. Patrick&amp;#39;s,372.305,1.768
"Day visit, including a reception in honor of the",374.073,3.57
Taoiseach and Mrs. Kenny.,377.643,1.435
"And as I mentioned, German Chancellor Merkel&amp;#39;s visit",379.078,3.971
"will resume on Friday, and we will have an update",383.049,2.402
on that schedule.,385.451,1.135
"With that, I&amp;#39;m glad to take a few questions.",386.586,1.801
"The Press: Sean, President Trump has said that under",388.387,4.105
his plan there will be insurance for everybody.,392.492,2.636
How do you square that with the CBO numbers?,395.128,2.268
And is that a promise he can really keep?,397.396,2.303
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think there&amp;#39;s two issues that",399.699,2.102
"are important to note on that, Katherine.",401.801,2.302
"Number one, more and more Americans have no choices,",404.103,3.17
so they don&amp;#39;t have insurance.,407.273,2.236
I&amp;#39;ve mentioned this before.,409.509,1.001
Having a card and having coverage that when you,410.51,3.67
walk into a doctor&amp;#39;s office has a deductible of,414.18,2.336
"$15,000, $20,000 a year isn&amp;#39;t coverage.",416.516,4.537
That&amp;#39;s a card.,421.053,0.735
That doesn&amp;#39;t get you the care you need.,421.788,1.768
That doesn&amp;#39;t allow you to get the procedure or the,423.556,2.703
referral that you need from a doctor that&amp;#39;s,426.259,2.102
telling you what you need to have happen.,428.361,2.269
That&amp;#39;s vastly different than what we hope to,430.63,2.569
"exist, which is giving people who don&amp;#39;t have it",433.199,3.503
-- and let&amp;#39;s kind of -- I think it&amp;#39;s important to,436.702,2.203
add some context to this.,438.905,1.067
If you think about the individual market that,439.972,2.97
"exists right now, the individual insurance",442.942,1.602
"market, you&amp;#39;ve got roughly 30 million people that",444.544,3.069
exist right now -- 9 million people now,447.613,3.27
are on the exchange.,450.883,0.768
That number has gone down; 6.5 million people have,451.651,3.303
said they don&amp;#39;t want any insurance and they&amp;#39;re,454.954,2.402
"going to pay a penalty, and then just under 14",457.356,2.803
million people have said that they have applied,460.159,3.103
for a hardship.,463.262,1.035
So you&amp;#39;ve got almost 20 million people in America,464.297,3.703
who have said that they don&amp;#39;t want Obamacare and,468,1.969
they&amp;#39;ll either pay a penalty or will apply,469.969,1.869
for a hardship.,471.838,1.134
Those are people who don&amp;#39;t have it to begin with.,472.972,2.236
"The exchanges sought out to cover these people, and",475.208,3.103
we&amp;#39;re finding out that you&amp;#39;ve got 9 million-plus,478.311,1.968
who are getting it right now.,480.279,1.302
They have no coverage.,481.581,1.034
"And for more and more Americans, they&amp;#39;re losing",482.615,2.202
"their coverage, their choices are gone.",484.817,2.736
Tax credits in competition that will come in phases,487.553,3.837
two and three in the prongs that we talked,491.39,1.802
"about will further drop prices down, will further",493.192,3.037
increase competition.,496.229,1.401
The CBO score didn&amp;#39;t take into consideration,497.63,2.836
in that.,500.466,0.667
"And again, if you look at their numbers, you&amp;#39;ve got",501.133,2.069
roughly just over 9 million people on,503.202,2.069
the exchanges.,505.271,1.134
The CBO number says that 14 million people in the,506.405,2.736
first year alone will lose coverage.,509.141,3.137
It doesn&amp;#39;t take a ton of analysis to recognize that,512.278,2.502
that doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense logically.,514.78,3.003
You can&amp;#39;t only have 9-plus million people on the,517.783,2.369
"exchange and say in the first year alone, when",520.152,2.136
"there&amp;#39;s no touch to Medicaid or anything else,",522.288,2.035
you&amp;#39;re just removing the individual mandate that,524.323,2.403
forced people to buy something that they didn&amp;#39;t,526.726,1.735
"want in the first place, that is going to lead to",528.461,3.136
14 million people -- that people are going to drop,531.597,1.969
"off Medicare, they&amp;#39;re not going to take their",533.566,1.368
employer -- that just doesn&amp;#39;t add up.,534.934,2.202
"In fact, I would argue that if you look at the",537.136,1.835
"other part of the equation, the 20",538.971,2.469
million-plus people who have either chosen to pay,541.44,2.269
a penalty -- you think about that -- the 6.5,543.709,2.236
million people are saying either the plan is too,545.945,2.235
"costly, the plan doesn&amp;#39;t provide coverage.",548.18,2.136
"I think a lot of those people, especially when we",550.316,1.735
"continue to instill additional coverage, they",552.051,2.636
"have more choices, they can pick a plan that",554.687,2.336
"actually fits their needs or fits their budget,",557.023,3.069
you&amp;#39;re going to see more people want coverage who,560.092,3.137
are going to choose coverage.,563.229,1.535
"So I think that the CBO number, A, they have a",564.764,3.17
record that doesn&amp;#39;t match up with the ability,567.934,2.502
to count people.,570.436,0.667
"They&amp;#39;re pretty good at dollars, not as",571.103,2.203
good at people.,573.306,1.067
And I think that when you look at the additional,574.373,2.369
phases or prongs of this whole comprehensive,576.742,3.204
"approach, that actually changes the",579.946,2.369
equation a lot.,582.315,0.667
"It&amp;#39;s looking at one piece of a three-part plan, and",582.982,3.27
that&amp;#39;s not the entirety of the plan that,586.252,1.601
we&amp;#39;re looking at.,587.853,0.901
So that doesn&amp;#39;t -- The Press: So what does the,588.754,2.369
White House think the change will be next year?,591.123,1.902
"Mr. Spicer: Well, again, I don&amp;#39;t think that we -- we",593.025,2.569
don&amp;#39;t do those projections.,595.594,1.102
"But I think that there&amp;#39;s no question, when you look",596.696,2.302
"at the cost, they&amp;#39;re already saying just this",598.998,2.402
"alone, just doing the first prong of this will",601.4,3.237
take costs down 10 percent in the individual market.,604.637,2.769
"If you think about it, they&amp;#39;re up 25 percent in",607.406,2.77
the individual market on average already.,610.176,2.702
"This year alone, on just people who are on the",612.878,1.769
"exchanges, up 25 percent.",614.647,2.169
"The CBO is saying, just with what we&amp;#39;re doing on",616.816,2.569
"the first prong alone, 10 percent decline in the",619.385,3.17
individual market.,622.555,1.034
That&amp;#39;s a significant reduction.,623.589,1.435
That&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re talking about.,625.024,1.335
"Bringing costs down, it increases choices.",626.359,1.835
That&amp;#39;s a big deal right now.,628.194,1.101
The problem that you have currently is that these,629.295,2.302
subsidies that people get get them a card that,631.597,2.569
doesn&amp;#39;t get them care.,634.166,1.235
"And that&amp;#39;s what we need to start focusing on, is how",635.401,3.27
many people are actually getting the care they need,638.671,2.169
to deal with the medical concerns of them,640.84,1.635
or their family.,642.475,0.7
And that&amp;#39;s not what&amp;#39;s happening. Mike.,643.175,1.335
"The Press: Sean, stating as you did that the",644.51,2.703
primary objection of this White House is that the,647.213,2.969
CBO report doesn&amp;#39;t take into account phase two and,650.182,2.937
"phase three, are there specifics either in terms",653.119,2.636
of the specific regulatory reforms that the White,655.755,2.636
House is considering and the specific terms of the,658.391,2.969
legislation that you would offer that are out there,661.36,2.403
for people to study as part of this?,663.763,2.135
"Because as you surely know, Tom Cotton among",665.898,2.102
others are skeptical of whether these phases can,668,2.469
actually --,670.469,0.701
"Mr. Spicer: Look, the things that I mentioned earlier --",671.17,3.503
allowing people to buy,674.673,1.035
"across state lines, to pool their insurance, to",675.708,2.402
"expand HSAs, to reform the FDA -- all of those things",678.11,4.305
I think unquestionably add competition and choice.,682.415,2.836
There&amp;#39;s no question about it.,685.251,1.301
"If one plan can sell that was in Maryland, into",686.552,2.903
"Virginia, where they can seek additional customers,",689.455,2.235
that competition alone invariably,691.69,2.002
brings down costs.,693.692,1.035
And we&amp;#39;ve seen this in market after market where,694.727,3.403
"once you allow competition, by itself,",698.13,2.703
that will bring down costs.,700.833,1.068
It will bring in choice.,701.901,1.434
Right now these insurance who have been mandated by,703.335,2.536
the government to create certain packages that,705.871,2.937
"people don&amp;#39;t need, you&amp;#39;ve got young people that are",708.808,3.637
being told to buy packages that have end-of-life care,712.445,3.603
that they don&amp;#39;t necessarily need.,716.048,1.602
You&amp;#39;ve got people who are in their older phases,717.65,1.868
having to buy stuff for maternity that may not be,719.518,5.339
a service that they need at their stage of life.,724.857,2.502
But the problem is that the government got,727.359,1.602
involved in health care and started dictating what,728.961,2.536
needed to happen instead of allowing the choice and,731.497,2.002
allow people to buy a plan that actually was tailored,733.499,2.836
to the needs that they want.,736.335,1.435
Those reforms in themselves unquestionably,737.77,3.47
bring down cost.,741.24,0.801
There&amp;#39;s no question.,742.041,1.368
But I think one of the issues that has to go back,743.409,3.003
to overriding this issue -- and the President has,746.412,2.502
stated this on numerous occasions -- if we do,748.914,3.037
"nothing, if we just allow this to continue, it will",751.951,3.503
collapse on its own.,755.454,1.568
The cost of it is unsustainable.,757.022,2.236
The premiums are going sky-high in,759.258,2.035
state after state.,761.293,0.835
And the choices keep going further and further down.,762.128,2.235
And so this idea of comparing it to Obamacare,764.363,3.971
is a false choice because they have no choice.,768.334,2.736
The choice is going away and the cost continues to,771.07,3.103
get higher through every phase.,774.173,1.635
And so to assume that the comparison is apples to,775.808,3.57
apples is a false choice.,779.378,1.368
The Press: I&amp;#39;m not making that.,780.746,0.934
But you&amp;#39;ve been critical from this podium of the,781.68,2.436
"Obama administration, of Democrats, in the way they",784.116,1.869
went about passing the Affordable Care Act.,785.985,1.968
In the interest of transparency that you,787.953,2.102
"accused them of not following, of shoving it",790.055,1.735
"down people&amp;#39;s throat, shouldn&amp;#39;t the White House,",791.79,1.836
should HHS put those details out now?,793.626,1.902
Should they put the legislative details out,795.528,1.835
and the subsequent steps in phase three?,797.363,1.968
Mr. Spicer: I think the House is working on that,799.331,1.335
in a lot of cases.,800.666,0.701
And as that legislation gets done --,801.367,1.334
"The Press: -- put the cards on the table now, because there&amp;#39;s a",802.701,1.335
lot of skepticism --,804.036,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I think that&amp;#39;s,804.703,0.668
"a great question for Speaker Ryan, and I know",805.371,1.334
that he&amp;#39;s been working with a team in getting it done.,806.705,1.335
And I think the sooner that we can get all those,808.04,1.368
"prongs out there, the better.",809.408,1.135
I agree with you.,810.543,0.867
"But I think the big difference, just so we&amp;#39;re",811.41,1.535
"clear, is that we posted this bill online, the",812.945,2.669
"Speaker had it out there, the President",815.614,1.335
tweeted it out.,816.949,1.068
"Anyone in the country and anyone in the world,",818.017,2.269
could read it.,820.286,0.667
That&amp;#39;s a vastly different approach than after it&amp;#39;s,820.953,2.269
"being done, told, after we pass it you can read it,",823.222,2.369
which is what Speaker Pelosi said.,825.591,1.335
The Press: Does the White House encourage,826.926,1.334
Republicans to put details of the phase three,828.26,1.335
legislation out there now?,829.595,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: I mean, sure.",830.262,1.335
"The more that can get out there on those phases,",831.597,1.368
absolutely.,832.965,0.667
And I know the Speaker is working with his,833.632,1.335
members to do that.,834.967,0.667
But I think that&amp;#39;s an appropriate question for,835.634,1.335
"the Speaker to answer, not for me.",836.969,1.335
I know that we are trying to work with them.,838.304,1.668
I know that there&amp;#39;s a lot of members that are,839.972,1.735
"working with Speaker Ryan and Leader McCarthy and,",841.707,2.169
"frankly, on the other chamber as well.",843.876,2.836
But I think that we continue -- and that&amp;#39;s why,846.712,1.902
I think we&amp;#39;re talking about all of those prongs,848.614,2.836
and all the pieces of them so that we can start,851.45,1.969
making sure that people understand the,853.419,1.802
comprehensive nature of this.,855.221,1.167
The Press: Will that happen before there&amp;#39;s a,856.388,1.969
vote on the --,858.357,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I think that&amp;#39;s a question for,859.024,1.335
Speaker Ryan to answer.,860.359,0.667
"I think the more we can get out there the better, though.",861.026,1.335
Alexis.,862.361,0.667
The Press: Can I follow up on what Mike was asking,863.028,3.337
about Senator Cotton?,866.365,1.134
Why is the White House giving Senator Cotton full,867.499,3.337
running room to go again and again in the media and,870.836,4.104
to denigrate the House plan without bringing him,874.94,2.97
"in, discussing with him what Mike was just",877.91,2.969
bringing up -- alternatives,880.879,1.502
that he&amp;#39;s suggesting?,882.381,1.101
Why does he have special dispensation to go out?,883.482,3.37
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t think he has,886.852,2.603
special dispensation.,889.455,0.734
It&amp;#39;s a free country; he can say what he wants.,890.189,2.502
The Press: But if you brought him in here --,892.691,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: No, I think our team has been working",894.026,1.368
with his team as they are with Senator Paul&amp;#39;s team,895.394,2.402
and anyone else who has ideas.,897.796,2.169
"We&amp;#39;ve been engaged in a very, very robust",899.965,2.836
discussion with members in both chambers who have,902.801,3.504
ideas to move this thing forward.,906.305,1.568
I don&amp;#39;t think we are able to tell people what they,907.873,4.471
can and cannot engage in a free society.,912.344,2.903
And Senator Cotton is obviously able to make any,915.247,2.202
comments that he&amp;#39;d like.,917.449,1.702
We&amp;#39;d obviously continue to like to work with him.,919.151,1.535
And I think the team will continue to reach out to,920.686,1.735
both he and his team to try to get,922.421,2.803
his ideas on this.,925.224,1.868
The Press: But the President spent time,927.092,1.602
talking to him about his ideas on immigration.,928.694,2.269
Has he called him?,930.963,1.201
Has the Vice President called Senator Cotton?,932.164,2.069
"Mr. Spicer: I know that we&amp;#39;ve had a very, very",934.233,3.003
robust discussion with members of the,937.236,1.334
House and Senate.,938.57,0.668
I would have to get specific details of what,939.238,2.002
we&amp;#39;ve done with specifically Senator Cotton.,941.24,2.636
The Press: Is Senator Cruz coming today?,943.876,1.334
Mr. Spicer: I believe he -- I&amp;#39;d have to,945.21,1.335
check on that.,946.545,0.667
I know that there was a group of individuals.,947.212,1.836
I don&amp;#39;t have that list in front of me.,949.048,1.568
The Press: Senators?,950.616,0.901
"Mr. Spicer: I will get back to you on that,",951.517,1.668
"Alexis, I promise.",953.185,1.068
The snowstorm kind of shifted a bunch of stuff,954.253,1.902
"up, so I don&amp;#39;t want to start getting in front of",956.155,2.269
who actually can be here and who can&amp;#39;t.,958.424,2.269
But I will make sure that we get those details out,960.693,2.335
and we have --,963.028,0.668
The Press: Can you get it to the pool?,963.696,1.368
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;d be glad to get it to the entire pool.,965.064,1.334
The Press: Thank you.,966.398,1.101
Mr. Spicer: Margaret.,967.499,1.202
The Press: Thank you.,968.701,1.601
So still on the same subject.,970.302,2.403
Does the White House support the House bill as,972.705,3.637
"it is, or amending it?",976.342,1.801
And there&amp;#39;s been reporting that the White House is,978.143,2.903
"involved, or some White House officials are",981.046,2.703
involved in shaping what&amp;#39;s being described as like a,983.749,2.469
major or significant manager&amp;#39;s amendment in,986.218,1.969
conjunction with conservatives.,988.187,0.901
Can you tell --,989.088,1.167
"Mr. Spicer: I would -- I&amp;#39;m sorry, please finish.",990.255,2.67
"The Press: No, we can go back and forth.",992.925,1.601
"But I&amp;#39;m just wondering, can you -- is the White",994.526,1.802
House writing this amendment or just,996.328,2.269
considering backing the amendment?,998.597,1.368
And does Paul Ryan know about it?,999.965,1.869
"We can tell him about it right now, I guess.",1001.834,1.434
Mr. Spicer: I think Speaker Ryan is well aware,1003.268,1.802
of the manager&amp;#39;s amendment.,1005.07,2.002
I think as we&amp;#39;ve noted multiple times from the,1008.073,1.702
"podium, when people have ideas that are",1009.775,2.102
"constructive or supportive, or ones that",1011.877,1.568
we have heard about from different members that we,1013.445,2.369
"have engaged with, and, frankly, ones that the",1015.814,2.536
House and Senate has engaged with who shared,1018.35,2.069
"ideas, we&amp;#39;ve always stated a willingness.",1020.419,2.836
"Director Mulvaney has talked about it, Secretary",1023.255,1.702
"Price, the President himself, the Vice President.",1024.957,1.968
Part of the reason we&amp;#39;re engaging with these,1026.925,2.203
"individuals is to hear their ideas, to talk to",1029.128,2.469
them about not just the content but the approach,1031.597,2.269
"-- what can go in, what can go out, how we deal",1033.866,2.802
"with the different phases, as Mike was asking,",1036.668,1.802
and when we go.,1038.47,1.168
But all of that is part of a comprehensive strategy,1039.638,2.803
"to engage with members who support us, who have ideas",1042.441,3.704
"and want to be onboard, who want to be",1046.145,1.334
constructive in the process and achieve the,1047.479,2.002
President&amp;#39;s goal of having a patient-centric,1049.481,2.236
healthcare system.,1051.717,0.734
So we are obviously in talks with House,1052.451,3.036
leadership about the contents.,1055.487,1.368
"But as I mentioned, the President will be on the",1056.855,2.036
phone with Speaker Ryan and Leader McCarthy later,1058.891,3.103
this afternoon to talk to them about some of these,1061.994,1.868
ideas and some of the path forward.,1063.862,1.835
But that&amp;#39;s part of the legislative process.,1065.697,2.269
"The Press: So all this -- actually, I have a",1067.966,2.102
second question.,1070.068,0.701
"But just to clarify this, so this involves -- the",1070.769,2.77
White House is working to help shape that,1073.539,1.768
manager&amp;#39;s amendment?,1075.307,0.901
Mr. Spicer: Yes.,1076.208,1.368
The Press: Okay.,1077.576,1.335
And on the visit of the Deputy Saudi Crown Prince,1078.911,4.504
"today, can you talk us through a little",1083.415,1.802
bit more detail?,1085.217,0.701
Does that involve the resumption of arms sales?,1085.918,1.801
Is that about oil?,1087.719,0.868
Mr. Spicer: It literally was wrapping up as we were,1088.587,1.768
"walking over here, so I want to make sure that I",1090.355,1.335
get a readout.,1091.69,0.667
"We&amp;#39;ll provide that to the pool, as we do with all",1092.357,1.335
the leader visits.,1093.692,0.667
So I will have more details from that once --,1094.359,1.335
they were concluding that visit as we were coming,1095.694,2.136
"here, and so I&amp;#39;ll make sure I get it. Blake.",1097.83,4.971
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1102.801,2.436
"In the middle of all this, there is also",1105.237,2.469
the debt ceiling.,1107.706,1.068
Mr. Spicer: Yeah.,1108.774,1.068
The Press: How urgent of a priority is this?,1109.842,3.203
And how concerned is the administration in tackling,1113.045,2.836
"this, given the letter that Secretary Mnuchin",1115.881,2.502
sent out last week?,1118.383,1.402
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, so Secretary Mnuchin sent a",1119.785,2.869
"letter noting that, under the Budget Reconciliation",1122.654,2.269
"Act, the Congress&amp;#39;s debt authority had",1124.923,3.337
until March 15th.,1128.26,1.902
He notified them of that.,1130.162,2.803
We continue to work with Congress.,1132.965,1.334
"As you know, we&amp;#39;ll be releasing a budget",1134.299,1.335
later this week.,1135.634,0.901
That&amp;#39;s part and parcel of our approach to fiscal,1136.535,2.135
"responsibility, to making sure that we talk about",1138.67,2.336
"the path forward, how we address both the ending of",1141.006,4.805
fiscal year &amp;#39;17 -- it goes until September 30th this,1145.811,3.47
"year -- and then the budget, which would",1149.281,1.501
be fiscal year &amp;#39;18.,1150.782,1.268
"But how we address our budget deficits, our debt,",1152.05,4.438
and our spending going forward is something that,1156.488,1.802
is a holistic conversation that the Secretary and,1158.29,3.604
"Director Mulvaney and others, and the President",1161.894,2.168
and the Vice President are engaging with Congress on.,1164.062,2.036
So this isn&amp;#39;t -- our job under the law was to,1166.098,3.27
notify them of the authority that they passed,1169.368,2.536
"when it expired, and I think the Secretary will",1171.904,2.836
work with Congress on a path forward as far as,1174.74,2.803
our debt situation.,1177.543,0.867
"The Press: Secondly, let me get your reaction to",1178.41,2.369
"Jonathan Gruber, one of the architects",1180.779,2.669
of Obamacare.,1183.448,0.935
He called essentially the plan that you&amp;#39;ve put,1184.383,2.435
"forward, if it&amp;#39;s implemented, a &amp;quot;scam.&amp;quot;",1186.818,2.837
Your reaction to that would be what?,1189.655,2.102
Mr. Spicer: I think that the plan that he helped,1191.757,4.237
create hasn&amp;#39;t done so well for Americans seeking,1195.994,2.67
health insurance.,1198.664,0.867
"Again, I have to go to the numbers.",1199.531,1.668
But just think about what he sought out to do.,1201.199,3.571
There was a pool of people that needed healthcare;,1204.77,2.969
they got about 9 million of them.,1207.739,1.335
You got 14.4-plus-or-minus million of people who,1209.074,4.204
claimed a hardship exemption -- so they have,1213.278,1.969
no insurance; that are not receiving Medicaid; that,1215.247,3.47
"don&amp;#39;t qualify for any other assistance, who",1218.717,3.337
can&amp;#39;t afford Obamacare.,1222.054,2.035
And then you&amp;#39;ve got another 6 million-plus,1224.089,3.036
that have chosen to pay the penalty.,1227.125,2.336
So I would argue that just on what he sought to,1229.461,2.903
achieve in the plan that he helped craft didn&amp;#39;t,1232.364,2.703
achieve too many great results.,1235.067,2.068
"Of the people that did get it, their premiums have",1237.135,3.671
"gone sky high, their choices have gone down,",1240.806,2.702
and singlehandedly had a tremendous effect through,1243.508,2.903
the rest of the healthcare system.,1246.411,2.102
So people who weren&amp;#39;t even affected by Obamacare,1248.513,3.27
initially have now paid higher premiums and,1251.783,2.77
get less choices.,1254.553,0.667
So even for 175 million people who get,1255.22,2.703
"employer-based healthcare, they felt the impact of",1257.923,3.103
"what he sought out to do through higher prices,",1261.026,2.502
few choices.,1263.528,1.168
"So, respectfully, I think that he should just hang",1264.696,3.07
out more time at MIT and focus -- and allow good,1267.766,4.238
ideas to continue to come forward so that we can,1272.004,2.502
focus on achieving the President&amp;#39;s goal of doing,1274.506,2.769
what he sought out in the first place. Zeke.,1277.275,1.335
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1278.61,1.268
The President several times recently has said,1279.878,2.736
that he would like his healthcare plan to have,1282.614,2.336
healthcare for everybody.,1284.95,0.967
Mr. Spicer: Right.,1285.917,0.935
The Press: The CBO score yesterday seems to,1286.852,2.536
indicate that that&amp;#39;s not the case.,1289.388,2.035
Will the White House commit that after these,1291.423,1.702
"phases two and three, if they are implemented, if",1293.125,3.069
"they&amp;#39;re ever offered publicly, that there will",1296.194,1.869
be healthcare for everybody?,1298.063,0.901
"And if you can define that phrase, please.",1298.964,1.802
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, I mean, I think everybody who",1300.766,2.135
wants -- look at what Obamacare did.,1302.901,2.369
"Again, I just ran through the numbers.",1305.27,1.635
You&amp;#39;ve got 30-plus million people of an,1306.905,4.138
Obamacare-mandated -- under penalty of law that,1311.043,2.702
"you had to have health insurance, 9 million of",1313.745,2.736
the 30-plus million -- 30 plus-or-minus people got,1316.481,3.304
"it; 4 million -- 4.5 [million] said, no, we&amp;#39;ll",1319.785,3.703
pay the penalty; and then another 14 or so,1323.488,2.436
million said that we&amp;#39;ll claim a hardship.,1325.924,3.203
So that was a government-mandated,1329.127,1.936
"system, and they chose not to do it.",1331.063,1.635
"I think that in many of these cases, that if",1332.698,2.302
people were given the choice and the option to,1335,2.869
"get a plan that sought their needs, was tailored",1337.869,3.737
"to what they wanted, it wasn&amp;#39;t forced down their",1341.606,2.069
"throat, that didn&amp;#39;t give them services they didn&amp;#39;t",1343.675,1.668
"want, and brought down costs -- I read you some",1345.343,2.069
of the stories of the individuals -- and we&amp;#39;ve,1347.412,1.635
seen tremendous growth from people who got a,1349.047,2.202
reasonably priced plan on the individual market --,1351.249,2.136
"$119, $150 bucks a month, which I think for people",1353.385,3.704
who aren&amp;#39;t getting their services through Medicaid,1357.089,2.535
"because of their financial situation, for many",1359.624,2.87
"middle-class families, while that&amp;#39;s still a",1362.494,1.501
"struggle, it&amp;#39;s an attainable goal",1363.995,1.969
in many cases.,1365.964,1.135
"When you&amp;#39;re talking about $350, $500 on the",1367.099,3.37
"individual market, that&amp;#39;s a huge chunk of someone&amp;#39;s",1370.469,3.036
individual take-home pay.,1373.505,1.902
And I think that getting a process that we have down,1375.407,4.104
"that levels the playing field, allows people who",1379.511,2.436
aren&amp;#39;t getting it through an employer-based system,1381.947,2.469
"to get a tax credit, that at the same time lowers",1384.416,2.736
"cost and creates more competition and choices,",1387.152,4.171
is actually going to give more people the option to,1391.323,2.068
have healthcare and to give more,1393.391,1.635
Americans that ability.,1395.026,1.035
"I mean, right now, they&amp;#39;re choosing not to do it.",1396.061,2.335
The Press: (Inaudible) you more people.,1398.396,1.369
That&amp;#39;s still not everybody.,1399.765,1.434
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, no, but everybody has a",1401.199,1.835
choice to get it.,1403.034,0.768
"And that&amp;#39;s what I think we want to do, is give",1403.802,1.702
everyone who wants to get healthcare the financial,1405.504,2.502
ability to get it is what the President is trying to,1408.006,4.004
achieve through this.,1412.01,0.968
And I think this is the system that will,1412.978,1.535
get them there.,1414.513,0.667
"Right now, they&amp;#39;re being forced to get it by a",1415.18,2.436
government-run system and in huge margins,1417.616,3.069
choosing not to.,1420.685,1.502
I think that&amp;#39;s the system.,1422.187,1.068
"And, by the way, they&amp;#39;re getting a system that&amp;#39;s",1423.255,2.235
failing and that is collapsing on its own and,1425.49,2.803
is only going in the wrong direction with higher,1428.293,1.869
"prices, higher premiums, higher deductibles,",1430.162,3.57
and lower choice.,1433.732,0.901
"I mean, that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;ve got now: If you&amp;#39;re",1434.633,1.902
"American citizen on the Obamacare exchange, you&amp;#39;re",1436.535,3.503
"paying more, you have a higher deductible, and",1440.038,2.736
your choice is going down.,1442.774,0.968
"And so that is an unsustainable,",1443.742,2.335
unacceptable outcome for Americans who need care. Dave.,1446.077,2.937
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1449.014,1.535
"On immigration, a group that tracks the number of",1450.549,3.47
sanctuary cities in the U.S.,1454.019,1.902
came out with a report today saying there&amp;#39;s now,1455.921,3.47
"nearly 500 sanctuary cities across the country,",1459.391,2.669
and that number has grown by about three dozen,1462.06,3.47
just this year.,1465.53,1.335
Does that concern the White House?,1466.865,1.335
And does it suggest that your warnings about,1468.2,2.369
withholding federal funds is not getting,1470.569,1.768
through to people?,1472.337,0.901
Mr. Spicer: I think the last poll I saw on this,1473.238,2.936
"issue, on sanctuary cities, was somewhere in",1476.174,2.536
the 80 percent that American people don&amp;#39;t,1478.71,2.569
"support sanctuary cities, they don&amp;#39;t want their tax",1481.279,1.835
dollars used to finance people who are in,1483.114,2.903
this country illegally.,1486.017,0.968
I think if you&amp;#39;re a mayor or a councilman or a state,1486.985,3.77
"representative or a governor in a state, you",1490.755,3.304
"need to answer to the people that elected you,",1494.059,2.903
whether or not you&amp;#39;re going to support this.,1496.962,1.735
"From a federal perspective, I think the",1498.697,1.768
President has been very clear that we&amp;#39;re not going,1500.465,2.069
to use federal taxpayer dollars to support cities,1502.534,3.236
that support services to people who are here in,1505.77,3.404
this country illegally.,1509.174,1.902
"But I think at the end of the day, this is a",1511.076,1.368
question for mayors and councilmembers at the,1512.444,2.436
local level who have to answer to the people that,1514.88,2.135
elected them with clearly a position that is not in,1517.015,3.337
keeping with what most Americans believe. Eamon.,1520.352,2.702
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1523.054,1.068
You mentioned the call with the CEO of,1524.122,1.702
Anthem Health.,1525.824,0.667
Can you tell me what this proposal of the President,1526.491,2.703
means for health insurance companies?,1529.194,1.401
Will their profits go up or down under the,1530.595,2.536
President&amp;#39;s proposal?,1533.131,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s been the",1533.798,1.469
focus of the President&amp;#39;s proposal.,1535.267,2.035
"It&amp;#39;s not about them, it&amp;#39;s about patients.",1537.302,2.102
But I think what it means for them is that they,1539.404,3.07
finally get to create more choice and more plans and,1542.474,4.004
allow people to choose a plan that fits them.,1546.478,2.936
"Right now, they don&amp;#39;t have that choice.",1549.414,1.768
"And, frankly, in more and more markets, companies",1551.182,2.269
"like Anthem, UnitedHealth, Signa are pulling out --",1553.451,5.639
Aetna -- because they don&amp;#39;t have the choice and,1559.09,2.67
because of the government mandate.,1561.76,1.334
I think what we want to do is allow competition and,1563.094,2.369
choice to exist so that they can offer more,1565.463,1.936
options for the American people.,1567.399,1.334
The Press: But will those companies make more money,1568.733,1.402
under the President&amp;#39;s plan or less?,1570.135,1.334
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know the answer to that.,1571.469,1.335
That&amp;#39;s not been the focus of what we&amp;#39;re doing now.,1572.804,2.069
"And at the end of the day, right now they&amp;#39;re pulling",1574.873,1.635
"out of market after market, leaving the",1576.508,2.302
American people with fewer and fewer choices.,1578.81,1.735
So right now it&amp;#39;s not a question of -- from the,1580.545,3.17
"last I checked, I think many of them were doing",1583.715,1.501
"pretty well, but it&amp;#39;s the American people and its",1585.216,2.236
patients that are losing under the current system.,1587.452,2.603
So I think that there&amp;#39;s a way you can do a,1590.055,1.434
little of both. Hunter.,1591.489,0.835
The Press: Yes.,1592.324,1.067
We&amp;#39;ve seen the White House and Secretary Price push,1593.391,3.17
back on calling this healthcare bill,1596.561,2.669
&amp;quot;Trumpcare.&amp;quot; Does anything need to change for the,1599.23,2.103
President to be comfortable putting his,1601.333,1.501
name on the bill?,1602.834,0.701
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I mean, I don&amp;#39;t think -- the Obama",1603.535,4.137
"administration didn&amp;#39;t label it Obamacare, they",1607.672,2.102
called it the ACA.,1609.774,1.835
"I mean, this is the American Health Care Act.",1611.609,2.803
The President is proud of it.,1614.412,1.035
The President is proud of the fact that we&amp;#39;re,1615.447,1.368
working with Congress.,1616.815,1.268
"But this is a bill that is not his, it&amp;#39;s a joint",1618.083,3.436
effort that we&amp;#39;ve worked with the House,1621.519,1.669
and the Senate on.,1623.188,1.268
He&amp;#39;s proud of it.,1624.456,0.834
He&amp;#39;s proud of the impact that it&amp;#39;s going to have on,1625.29,2.803
American patients.,1628.093,1.534
"So I don&amp;#39;t think this is about labels and names,",1629.627,3.07
this is about getting a job done. John.,1632.697,2.87
The Press: You keep pointing out that the CBO,1635.567,3.236
did not take into consideration phases,1638.803,2.369
two or three.,1641.172,1.035
Some people might say that the White House has been,1642.207,1.668
criticizing the CBO for not taking into account,1643.875,2.769
phases two and three in their scoring of the,1646.644,2.703
first phase of this.,1649.347,1.769
How are they supposed to take into account,1651.116,2.135
something that doesn&amp;#39;t yet exist?,1653.251,1.401
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think that that&amp;#39;s a question",1654.652,2.169
for the House offer.,1656.821,1.735
There are constraints that are put on the CBO in,1658.556,2.47
terms of what they can&amp;#39;t consider.,1661.026,1.401
But I think that the point that we want to make is,1662.427,2.269
that -- and it came up yesterday at the briefing,1664.696,1.468
-- if members are going to base their vote off a,1666.164,2.903
"score, they need to understand the totality",1669.067,2.369
and comprehensive nature of the entire program.,1671.436,3.403
And so to base your score off of one piece of information,1674.839,5.172
is literally looking --,1680.011,0.801
The Press: But --,1680.812,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Hold on, let me answer",1681.479,1.335
the question.,1682.814,0.701
The Press: That&amp;#39;s all they had.,1683.515,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I understand that.,1684.182,0.667
"But what I&amp;#39;m saying is, is that the question that",1684.849,1.335
keeps being asked is to see all the reports on,1686.184,2.803
this about how it&amp;#39;s going to impact and not note --,1688.987,2.936
"I mean, I don&amp;#39;t recall too many packages that read on",1691.923,3.137
"the evening news last night, or too many of the",1695.06,1.501
stories noting that it was one piece of a,1696.561,2.202
"comprehensive package, noting that it was prong",1698.763,2.269
one of three prongs.,1701.032,1.535
"So, respectfully, I think that when we&amp;#39;ve gone out",1702.567,2.669
here and tried to make sure that people,1705.236,1.535
understand the comprehensive nature of,1706.771,2.336
what&amp;#39;s happening and why it has to happen -- it,1709.107,2.97
wasn&amp;#39;t by choice that we had to do this.,1712.077,1.601
There are certain ways that it had to be,1713.678,1.602
conducted because of how it was constructed in the,1715.28,2.702
first place in terms of how it gets,1717.982,1.535
repealed and replaced.,1719.517,1.235
"The reconciliation piece of this, which is",1720.752,2.536
inside-baseball Senate talk may not make sense to,1723.288,4.538
"a lot of people, but it&amp;#39;s the way that we have to go",1727.826,2.869
-- the process by which we have to achieve this,1730.695,2.77
"because of the Senate rules, which is how it was",1733.465,2.168
constructed in the first place when Democrats,1735.633,1.802
enacted it in 2009.,1737.435,1.435
"That being said, when we talk about this -- again,",1738.87,3.604
"you guys, when there&amp;#39;s a report that comes out on",1742.474,2.369
"the evening news, or on cable news, or in the",1744.843,1.901
"paper, and it doesn&amp;#39;t explain the comprehensive",1746.744,2.67
"nature of this, and it just said, &amp;quot;the CBO says",1749.414,2.369
"this is the impact, full stop,&amp;quot; it is incumbent",1751.783,3.403
upon to make sure that people who are trying to,1755.186,2.469
understand what we&amp;#39;re doing understand that,1757.655,2.369
there are two more pieces to come of this.,1760.024,2.069
"And like anything else, it&amp;#39;s like",1762.093,1.335
building a puzzle.,1763.428,0.667
"If you only put a third of it on the table and said,",1764.095,2.669
"hey, look, this puzzle is incomplete, we hid the",1766.764,1.869
"other two-thirds pieces, is not explaining to",1768.633,2.236
people how the whole thing comes together.,1770.869,1.534
"I think that is a very, very important piece of",1772.403,2.937
explaining how this whole thing is going to matter,1775.34,2.736
and impact the American people.,1778.076,1.268
"The Press: The other thing I&amp;#39;m curious about, too, is",1779.344,1.601
"can this thing -- the President called it a big,",1780.945,3.037
beautiful negotiation.,1783.982,2.235
"People like Jim Jordan say it&amp;#39;s a big, beautiful dud.",1786.217,3.037
Is there a way to hammer this thing into shape,1789.254,2.402
where you can satisfy conservatives?,1791.656,1.735
Mr. Spicer: I hope so.,1793.391,1.335
The Press: Or do you have to -- as has been,1794.726,1.334
suggested by a number of people -- rip it up and,1796.06,2.403
start all over again?,1798.463,1.134
Because Jim Jordan just this morning was saying,1799.597,2.369
that the fundamental aspects of what was,1801.966,2.136
promised the American people by House members,1804.102,3.136
"when they ran for election back in the fall, and by",1807.238,3.904
"the President when he ran for election, is",1811.142,2.77
not in this bill.,1813.912,0.834
"Mr. Spicer: Well, respectfully, I would",1814.746,1.902
suggest that it&amp;#39;s gone through two House,1816.648,2.202
committees that consisted of over 50 Republican,1818.85,2.169
members -- when you look at both committees --,1821.019,2.169
with unanimous support.,1823.188,1.368
So I get that we can&amp;#39;t --,1824.556,1.901
The Press: (Inaudible),1826.457,1.268
not a Freedom Caucus member on either one of those?,1827.725,1.635
Mr. Spicer: Okay.,1829.36,0.668
I don&amp;#39;t know that that&amp;#39;s actually true.,1830.028,1.334
"The Press: Well, that&amp;#39;s what they said.",1831.362,1.368
"Mr. Spicer: I understand that, but -- I&amp;#39;m going to",1832.73,1.335
use Major Garrett to fact-check you.,1834.065,1.335
(Laughter.),1835.4,0.667
"The Press: Well, that&amp;#39;s just what they&amp;#39;re saying.",1836.067,1.335
They&amp;#39;re saying they didn&amp;#39;t get a chance --,1837.402,2.235
Mr. Spicer: Four Pinocchios -- John Roberts.,1839.637,1.569
The Press: I did not say that.,1841.206,1.568
(Laughter.),1842.774,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: But my point is, I think that",1843.441,1.568
we&amp;#39;ve got tremendous support.,1845.009,0.901
"The President, as I&amp;#39;ve stated, wants to",1845.91,1.735
work with them.,1847.645,0.668
There will be a manager&amp;#39;s amendment.,1848.313,1.534
"And I hope that ultimately -- yeah, I&amp;#39;d love to have",1849.847,3.104
every member support this on both,1852.951,1.368
sides of the aisle.,1854.319,0.667
I think the President&amp;#39;s principles and goals are,1854.986,2.803
going to benefit every American.,1857.789,1.334
"And obviously, the more support we get,",1859.123,2.169
the better.,1861.292,0.801
And as we continue to meet with members and talk to,1862.093,2.336
"them and get their ideas, I think we&amp;#39;re going to",1864.429,1.868
have a phenomenal outcome of this bill.,1866.297,1.635
There&amp;#39;s a lot of ways we continue to gather,1867.932,3.771
input and ideas.,1871.703,0.834
And the more that we can get that will achieve,1872.537,3.003
"that goal, great.",1875.54,1.234
And so I hope that he continues to provide us,1876.774,2.803
"with constructive ideas, and we look forward to",1879.577,2.836
getting as many as possible. Major.,1882.413,1.368
"The Press: Sure, let&amp;#39;s continue that",1883.781,1.335
"conversation, because the manager&amp;#39;s amendment --",1885.116,1.802
Mr. Spicer: Now it&amp;#39;s John&amp;#39;s chance to fact check.,1886.918,1.635
(Laughter.),1888.553,0.667
The Press: The manager&amp;#39;s amendment is,1889.22,1.335
"a tacit admission that the bill, as written, can&amp;#39;t pass.",1890.555,1.501
You wouldn&amp;#39;t --,1892.056,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: No, that&amp;#39;s not",1892.724,0.7
entirely true --,1893.424,0.668
The Press: You wouldn&amp;#39;t put,1894.092,0.7
together a manager&amp;#39;s amendment if you had,1894.792,1.335
"the votes, correct?",1896.127,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Well, no, I think it&amp;#39;s an admission of",1896.794,1.902
what we stated at the beginning of this entire,1898.696,2.536
"process, which is the President was going to",1901.232,1.602
engage with members to hear their ideas.,1902.834,2.702
He welcomed them.,1905.536,0.668
"Director Mulvaney stated it multiple times, and",1906.204,2.135
"Secretary Price, the Vice President.",1908.339,1.735
We&amp;#39;re not -- this has never been a &amp;quot;take it,1910.074,2.303
or leave it.&amp;quot;,1912.377,0.667
And I&amp;#39;ve said it from this podium; the President has,1913.044,2.102
"talked about it, as you",1915.146,0.701
mentioned just a second ago.,1915.847,2.235
This is an opportunity to hear from individuals and,1918.082,2.269
"groups and insurance -- and victims of Obamacare,",1920.351,3.904
doctors -- The Press: So is the goal of the,1924.255,1.368
manager&amp;#39;s amendment to win more Freedom,1925.623,1.335
Caucus support --,1926.958,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Hold on.,1927.625,0.668
It&amp;#39;s not a question of just -- it&amp;#39;s not about --,1928.293,1.334
The Press: -- by dealing with Medicaid or the tax,1929.627,1.335
credits or some other alterations?,1930.962,1.335
Mr. Spicer: It&amp;#39;s not about one caucus or one member.,1932.297,1.668
The Press: It&amp;#39;s not?,1933.965,0.667
Mr. Spicer: No.,1934.632,0.668
I think this is about bringing people together.,1935.3,1.468
And if we have great ideas that will achieve a better,1936.768,2.702
"outcome for the American people, then we&amp;#39;re going",1939.47,1.602
to listen to them and we&amp;#39;re going to,1941.072,1.335
incorporate them.,1942.407,0.667
I don&amp;#39;t think that this is -- we have been very clear,1943.074,3.503
from the get-go: If you can come with a good idea,1946.577,3.404
"that will strengthen this bill, that will benefit",1949.981,1.635
"American patients, we&amp;#39;ll do it.",1951.616,1.401
And so the manager&amp;#39;s amendment is -- The,1953.017,2.303
"Press: Passing a bill is about getting votes, right?",1955.32,1.434
"You can&amp;#39;t have a strong bill that can&amp;#39;t pass, right?",1956.754,2.002
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, you can -- absolutely.",1958.756,1.869
"But you can jam through a bill and get it out, and",1960.625,1.368
get 218 and send it over to the Senate.,1961.993,1.968
But I think that we want to get the strongest bill,1963.961,2.103
through the House with as many ideas and opinions,1966.064,3.903
and facts that will help strengthen,1969.967,3.537
this as possible.,1973.504,0.935
So I&amp;#39;d rather -- instead of getting a bill through,1974.439,2.702
"with 218, 219 -- work on a process as the Speaker and",1977.141,4.638
the Majority Leader have done that brings,1981.779,2.503
in additional ideas.,1984.282,0.901
"And if we can get the bill higher and higher,",1985.183,1.434
we will.,1986.617,0.668
The Press: To Tom Cotton&amp;#39;s point -- because you,1987.285,1.902
"talked about it just a second ago, prongs two and",1989.187,2.068
three -- he went out of his way to describe that,1991.255,3.003
"process, process two and three -- because at least",1994.258,3.237
the third part of that is going to require 60 votes,1997.495,3.57
because it&amp;#39;s outside of reconciliation -- by,2001.065,2.236
"definition &amp;quot;as mythical, imaginary, and just spin.&amp;quot;",2003.301,2.269
"And he&amp;#39;s telling House Republicans, don&amp;#39;t buy",2005.57,2.335
into this third- or second-prong argument,2007.905,1.969
"because a practical,",2009.874,1.034
legislative matter don&amp;#39;t exist.,2010.908,1.402
Because you need 60 votes to get them.,2012.31,2.836
"And so if you &amp;quot;walk the plank&amp;quot; -- his words, not",2015.146,2.002
"mine -- on this first initiative, you&amp;#39;re not",2017.148,3.07
going to get second and third phase of this,2020.218,2.269
process because it can&amp;#39;t get through the Senate.,2022.487,2.269
Mr. Spicer: So there&amp;#39;s a couple things.,2024.756,2.268
"First, this is the only vehicle that seeks to",2027.024,3.637
achieve what people on our side of the aisle have,2030.661,1.736
been talking about since 2010.,2032.397,1.768
This is it.,2034.165,1.101
"If we don&amp;#39;t get this through, the goal of",2035.266,4.371
repealing Obamacare and instituting a system that,2039.637,3.537
will be patient-centered is going to be,2043.174,1.802
unbelievably difficult.,2044.976,1.902
This is the vehicle to do that.,2046.878,1.368
And so we welcome Senator Cotton&amp;#39;s ideas.,2048.246,2.235
But the second prong of,2050.481,1.168
this is administrative in nature.,2051.649,1.435
It is something that was delegated to Kathleen,2053.084,2.269
"Sebelius, who was then the Secretary of Health and",2055.353,3.103
"Human Services, to do.",2058.456,1.234
"So prong two is actually fairly easy to do, because",2059.69,3.237
the same authority that was granted to Secretary,2062.927,2.069
Sebelius now is in the auspices of Dr. Price.,2064.996,4.137
And he has the ability to implement and work on,2069.133,2.603
"that, and I think he noted it yesterday that his",2071.736,1.702
office has already been,2073.438,0.834
going through and doing that.,2074.272,1.201
So that phase is easy to do.,2075.473,1.969
"The third prong, which is all of these things that",2077.442,2.168
conservatives have been championing for a long,2079.61,1.769
"time, and, frankly, many Democrats agree with us",2081.379,2.836
"on, is this ability to bring down costs through",2084.215,3.103
selling over state lines and allowing small,2087.318,1.902
businesses to group together is something that,2089.22,2.869
we&amp;#39;ve been talking about for over a decade.,2092.089,1.969
The Press: And you can get 60 votes?,2094.058,1.969
Mr. Spicer: And I think that we can not just get,2096.027,2.069
60 -- I think this is something that should,2098.096,1.634
bring people together.,2099.73,0.868
"I think there is bipartisan, bicameral",2100.598,2.336
support for almost every one of these things,2102.934,2.335
because they benefit -- there is no one that,2105.269,1.835
doesn&amp;#39;t benefit.,2107.104,0.935
Who could be against allowing insurance to be,2108.039,3.403
sold over state lines?,2111.442,0.868
It&amp;#39;s something that you can do your car insurance,2112.31,1.835
-- so many -- there is no other product that I can,2114.145,2.869
think of -- I&amp;#39;m sure someone will fact-check me,2117.014,1.569
"on this -- but for the most part, the American",2118.583,2.102
"consumer, when you want a product, you can go",2120.685,2.169
"online, you can go to a store.",2122.854,1.735
You have choice.,2124.589,0.734
You could go to a store across state lines.,2125.323,1.735
"If you live in Virginia, you can drive to Maryland",2127.058,1.868
or the District and shop around.,2128.926,3.704
"With our insurance, we don&amp;#39;t have that ability.",2132.63,2.569
There&amp;#39;s no question that increased competition,2135.199,2.67
drives down cost.,2137.869,1.701
It is just an economic certainty.,2139.57,2.67
And allowing greater choice will do the same.,2142.24,2.902
"And so I think, respectfully, I would say",2145.142,2.47
"to any senator that has that concern, there is no",2147.612,3.336
other entity that I can think of that greater,2150.948,3.003
choice and greater competition doesn&amp;#39;t drive,2153.951,1.869
down cost significantly.,2155.82,0.934
And all we have to do is look no farther,2156.754,2.202
than Obamacare.,2158.956,0.668
I read off three of the individuals the President,2159.624,2.469
met with yesterday who were victims of Obamacare.,2162.093,1.902
"In every one of those cases, the insurance",2163.995,2.636
premium went skyrocketing when what?,2166.631,2.569
When choice and competition went away.,2169.2,3.537
Most any person that was in the individual market,2172.737,3.236
eight or nine years ago will tell you that,2175.973,2.102
"depending on the plan, you could get a plan for as",2178.075,1.969
low as 100 bucks and change.,2180.044,2.369
Now the cheapest plan you can get is easily,2182.413,2.169
in the $300 range.,2184.582,1.268
And so the question that you have to ask yourself,2185.85,2.602
"is, what changed?",2188.452,1.368
Competition went down and choice went down.,2189.82,2.236
And I think allowing both of those to reenter the,2192.056,2.135
marketplace will achieve in itself that goal.,2194.191,3.371
And going through the additional pieces of the,2197.562,1.601
reform will also do the same thing.,2199.163,2.035
There&amp;#39;s so many ways that we can achieve greater,2201.198,2.636
choice and competition that unquestionably bring,2203.834,3.404
down the cost of health care that benefits every,2207.238,2.669
"American, whether or not you&amp;#39;re in the exchanges or",2209.907,2.002
you&amp;#39;re on an employer-based plan.,2211.909,2.236
"And again, we have to have this conversation in the",2214.145,3.804
context of what&amp;#39;s going on now.,2217.949,1.434
Talk to somebody that&amp;#39;s on Medicare or Medicaid.,2219.383,2.803
Ask them if the doctor and services that they used to,2222.186,2.569
be getting are available to them.,2224.755,1.869
I know so many times now when you walk into the,2226.624,1.735
"doctor they have a sign that says, &amp;quot;We no longer",2228.359,2.569
accept Medicaid.&amp;quot;,2230.928,1.835
That used to be a given almost.,2232.763,2.403
"And now, for older Americans, for Americans",2235.166,3.37
"at the lower end of the income scale, it&amp;#39;s",2238.536,1.968
becoming harder and harder to find a place that even,2240.504,1.635
takes your insurance.,2242.139,1.368
And I think that to find that an acceptable income,2243.507,3.938
-- the question has to be asked of people who oppose,2247.445,2.369
"this, no matter what side of the aisle they&amp;#39;re on,",2249.814,1.401
"is, what is your alternative?",2251.215,2.403
Because the ideas that they propose we can,2253.618,3.169
"incorporate, we can make this better and better.",2256.787,2.77
But to sit back and act as though there&amp;#39;s a choice.,2259.557,1.968
Doing nothing is not a choice.,2261.525,2.103
And that&amp;#39;s something the President had done. Trey.,2263.628,1.468
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",2265.096,0.734
"As you know, the DOJ now has an additional week to",2265.83,2.569
produce evidence that President Trump was,2268.399,2.002
wiretapped by the Obama administration.,2270.401,1.702
How confident is President Trump that any evidence,2272.103,2.669
will arise to support his claim?,2274.772,2.002
Mr. Spicer: I think he&amp;#39;s extremely confident.,2276.774,2.336
"There&amp;#39;s been -- I mean, I mentioned this before --",2279.11,2.369
I&amp;#39;ll let them do their job.,2281.479,1.368
I&amp;#39;ll let the House and Senate and I&amp;#39;ll let the,2282.847,1.334
DOJ report this.,2284.181,1.602
"But as I commented in the past, I think there&amp;#39;s",2285.783,2.436
significant reporting about surveillance,2288.219,3.47
techniques that have existed throughout,2291.689,1.735
the 2016 election.,2293.424,1.468
I&amp;#39;ll leave it to them to issue their report.,2294.892,2.102
But I think he feels very confident it that will,2296.994,2.102
ultimately come to this -- will vindicate him.,2299.096,3.938
The Press: And a quick follow-up.,2303.034,2.268
"When a decision is announced, whatever",2305.302,2.269
"evidence or potentially no evidence is released, will",2307.571,3.003
he make a statement about the evidence or,2310.574,3.037
lack of evidence?,2313.611,1.101
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;ve been asked this I think at,2314.712,2.369
"least three times, and I don&amp;#39;t want to prejudge",2317.081,3.337
what&amp;#39;s going to come.,2320.418,1.101
I&amp;#39;m sure you will do a fine job of asking me the,2321.519,2.602
question when there&amp;#39;s a report to be asked and I,2324.121,3.037
will not be able to escape it.,2327.158,1.468
But I don&amp;#39;t want to get ahead of what the,2328.626,1.535
President may or may not do. Jim.,2330.161,1.334
The Press: Evidence will be presented?,2331.495,1.569
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t want to get ahead of -- as I,2333.064,3.77
"mentioned, I&amp;#39;m not going to --",2336.834,1.335
The Press: Because the House Intelligence Committee,2338.169,1.868
has given the administration until Monday --,2340.037,2.302
Mr. Spicer: I understand --,2342.339,1.268
"no, it&amp;#39;s given the DOJ, and the",2343.607,1.202
Department of Justice.,2344.809,0.767
"Again, we covered this yesterday.",2345.576,1.602
But I&amp;#39;m not going to get ahead of what they may or,2347.178,3.436
may not submit.,2350.614,0.668
The Press: It&amp;#39;s possible there may be nothing.,2351.282,1.501
"Mr. Spicer: No, that&amp;#39;s not -- I think there is -- at",2352.783,2.136
"least from where we stand, we know that there&amp;#39;s",2354.919,2.002
significant reporting on the subject that --,2356.921,3.336
The Press: Something will be presented.,2360.257,2.269
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, I feel very confident of that.",2362.526,1.902
The Press: Okay.,2364.428,0.701
And a follow-up on coverage.,2365.129,1.735
You were saying that people -- if they can&amp;#39;t,2366.864,5.272
"get access to insurance, they don&amp;#39;t have coverage.",2372.136,1.835
"But if you remove the individual mandate, you",2373.971,2.536
are going to have people who are not going to buy,2376.507,2.269
"coverage, they&amp;#39;re not going to buy insurance.",2378.776,1.635
And so getting back to the Congressional Budget,2380.411,1.968
"Office score, would you concede that there will be",2382.379,3.17
"some coverage losses, perhaps in the millions?",2385.549,3.27
That there will be millions of people who,2388.819,2.002
will not have health insurance as a result of,2390.821,2.736
what you&amp;#39;re doing?,2393.557,1.235
"Mr. Spicer: Well, again -- sure, except you have to",2394.792,3.136
look at the current situation.,2397.928,1.635
You are mandated by law to buy insurance right now,2399.563,2.703
under Obamacare; 13-plus million people have asked,2402.266,3.67
"for a hardship exemption, and 6.5-plus million",2405.936,3.37
people have determined to pay the penalty.,2409.306,2.77
"So, currently, if we look at the universe and say",2412.076,3.27
"it&amp;#39;s roughly 30 million people, only 9 million",2415.346,3.103
people engaged in the exchanges when,2418.449,2.369
required by law.,2420.818,2.202
"The majority, almost two-thirds, if my",2423.02,2.236
back-of-the-envelope math is right -- about,2425.256,3.303
two-thirds have chosen to either apply for a,2428.559,1.935
hardship exemption or pay a penalty.,2430.494,2.169
The Press: The mandate forces people to buy,2432.663,2.169
"insurance, and if they don&amp;#39;t have insurance then",2434.832,2.502
you have the free rider problem in the system --,2437.334,1.769
Mr. Spicer: Right.,2439.103,0.667
But look at what&amp;#39;s happening now --,2439.77,1.335
The Press: -- which was a problem in the,2441.105,1.334
Obama administration.,2442.439,0.668
You have free riders and those folks --,2443.107,1.368
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, no, because the current --",2444.475,1.401
"The Press: -- in a car accident, they show up at the emergency",2445.876,1.335
"room, and then the health care is",2447.211,1.335
much more expensive.,2448.546,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: But my point, Jim, is that the way the",2449.213,1.335
"system was constructed under Obamacare, they",2450.548,2.769
created a system to force people to buy plans that,2453.317,3.303
they did not like.,2456.62,0.768
They were mandated by the government in terms of,2457.388,2.235
"what was part of the plan, what it had to cover, the",2459.623,2.169
"deductible, et cetera, et cetera, and yet, roughly",2461.792,2.97
two-thirds of the people either paid a penalty or,2464.762,3.103
asked for a hardship exemption.,2467.865,1.601
They didn&amp;#39;t do it.,2469.466,1.168
"And so the idea is, actually, if you could",2470.634,2.269
bring down cost and choices and allow people,2472.903,2.236
"to find a plan that fit their budget, that was",2475.139,2.402
"tailored to their needs, there is actually a higher",2477.541,2.269
likelihood that they will find something that they,2479.81,2.202
want at a price that they can afford -- as to right,2482.012,2.57
"now, which is I get a plan that I&amp;#39;m forced to buy",2484.582,2.836
"that has a deductible that I can&amp;#39;t afford, but I&amp;#39;ve",2487.418,2.135
got a cute little plastic card that I can,2489.553,1.935
wave around.,2491.488,0.701
The Press: But it will get you coverage.,2492.189,2.069
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, that&amp;#39;s not true.",2494.258,1.368
"The Press: If you show up at the emergency room, if",2495.626,1.335
"you&amp;#39;ve been hit by a bus, you&amp;#39;re not going to need",2496.961,1.534
to pay out of pocket to the hospital,2498.495,2.236
until you die.,2500.731,0.667
You&amp;#39;re going to have some sort of catastrophic,2501.398,2.002
coverage that will make sure you have insurance.,2503.4,2.369
That is the point.,2505.769,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: Thank you, that&amp;#39;s a great",2506.437,1.334
advertisement for --,2507.771,0.668
The Press: You&amp;#39;re welcome.,2508.439,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Thank you. That&amp;#39;s exactly what the President,2509.106,1.368
is trying to do.,2510.474,0.734
Because right now you&amp;#39;ve got -- of the attempt to,2511.208,3.704
"get 30 million people covered, 14.4 or 14.5",2514.912,3.737
million people applied for a hardship exemption.,2518.649,2.002
They&amp;#39;re exactly the people that you&amp;#39;re talking about.,2520.651,2.069
Another 6.5 million people have paid the penalty and,2522.72,3.703
don&amp;#39;t have it.,2526.423,0.668
So we have roughly 20 million people in this,2527.091,2.402
country who were supposed to be paying -- required,2529.493,3.036
to buy health care that have chosen not to do it,2532.529,3.037
who fall in exactly the category that,2535.566,2.069
you&amp;#39;re talking about.,2537.635,1.034
The question -- The Press: But that number is massive,2538.669,3.437
by the year 2026 -- more than 20 million Americans,2542.106,3.203
-- Mr. Spicer: But if they actually had choices and,2545.309,2.836
had a plan option that was down near a budget that,2548.145,2.669
"they could afford, there is a higher likelihood",2550.814,2.269
"that they would buy a plan that was, A, tailored to",2553.083,2.069
"them, and B, actually that they could afford.",2555.152,3.003
"So to your question about catastrophic, right now",2558.155,1.969
that&amp;#39;s in most cases not even an option.,2560.124,2.102
In a third of all the counties in the United,2562.226,1.568
"States, they only have one choice.",2563.794,1.335
"In five states, they have one choice.",2565.129,2.169
Can you imagine if they could actually buy a plan --,2567.298,2.535
"The Press: You&amp;#39;re saying a talking point,",2569.833,1.502
but at least --,2571.335,0.667
Mr. Spicer: It&amp;#39;s not a talking point.,2572.002,1.335
The Press: -- there&amp;#39;s coverage in those states.,2573.337,1.335
There&amp;#39;s an option of coverage.,2574.672,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, it means -- right, and in a",2575.339,1.368
lot of -- The Press: If you pull this away then,2576.707,1.335
you&amp;#39;re going to have people in a lot of states,2578.042,1.334
who aren&amp;#39;t going to have access to any coverage --,2579.376,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, totally false.",2580.711,1.335
The Press: -- because they can&amp;#39;t afford it with these,2582.046,1.334
tax credits that you&amp;#39;re providing.,2583.38,1.368
"Mr. Spicer: No, no -- The",2584.748,0.668
Press: There&amp;#39;s an argument to the other side --,2585.416,1.334
"Mr. Spicer: No, there&amp;#39;s not. No, actually --",2586.75,1.335
The Press: The subsidies are more generous --,2588.085,1.335
Mr. Spicer: You&amp;#39;ve got 175 million,2589.42,1.334
Americans that get their insurance through,2590.754,1.335
their employer.,2592.089,0.701
"And frankly, right now they&amp;#39;re the ones who keep",2592.79,1.334
paying higher and higher premiums because a system,2594.124,1.335
that was only supposed to help people get access and,2595.459,3.103
"require them -- get a government-mandated,",2598.562,3.837
government-run healthcare has actually gone amuck.,2602.399,4.138
And so right now --,2606.537,0.6
The Press: You say government-run health care.,2607.137,1.335
Medicare is government run.,2608.472,1.235
"Mr. Spicer: Right, and what&amp;#39;s happening --",2609.707,0.667
The Press: You don&amp;#39;t have senior citizens screaming,2610.374,1.868
that they want you to get rid of their Medicare.,2612.242,1.969
"Mr. Spicer: Yes, they are.",2614.211,0.534
I think you need to maybe get outside and talk to,2614.745,1.702
"some of them, because more and more Medicaid",2616.447,1.368
"recipients -- in fact, more and more Medicare",2617.815,2.269
recipients -- aren&amp;#39;t actually able,2620.084,1.301
to get coverage.,2621.385,0.867
"Again, it&amp;#39;s one thing to have a card.",2622.252,1.402
It&amp;#39;s another thing to walk into a doctor&amp;#39;s office and,2623.654,2.102
"them to tell you, we no longer accept",2625.756,1.635
Medicaid anymore.,2627.391,1.034
That&amp;#39;s not care.,2628.425,0.935
The Press: But the President is okay with,2629.36,2.035
there are going to be millions of people who,2631.395,1.401
aren&amp;#39;t going to have coverage?,2632.796,3.537
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, the President&amp;#39;s goal is to",2636.333,1.368
provide healthcare coverage to every American.,2637.701,1.335
And right now they&amp;#39;re not getting that.,2639.036,1.335
"And by giving them more choices at a lower cost,",2640.371,2.235
more Americans can either buy healthcare for their,2642.606,2.803
"family or themselves, or, in a lot of cases, for",2645.409,2.636
"their business, without paying the penalty, which",2648.045,2.636
"is what a lot of them are doing, or forcing people",2650.681,1.835
into exchanges that have fewer and fewer choices.,2652.516,2.402
The system now is not working.,2654.918,3.404
"The costs are going up, the choices are going",2658.322,2.035
"down, and deductibles are going up.",2660.357,2.002
That is not an option.,2662.359,1.702
And for every American -- and I mentioned this,2664.061,1.501
"earlier -- to make this look like a choice, there",2665.562,3.838
isn&amp;#39;t really a choice.,2669.4,0.867
The system that we have now is failing.,2670.267,3.103
The choice is whether we give them an opportunity,2673.37,2.302
to have real care and in a way that is tailored to,2675.672,3.771
them in their budget. Jeff.,2679.443,1.568
"The Press: Sean, on a different subject.",2681.011,2.569
"The Intelligence Committee yesterday, when responding",2683.58,1.902
to the Department of Justice&amp;#39;s request for more,2685.482,2.503
"time, basically issued a subpoena threat.",2687.985,1.902
Does the White House have a reaction to that?,2689.887,2.836
Do you think it will come that far?,2692.723,2.502
Mr. Spicer: I hope not.,2695.225,1.468
"And as I said, as has been noted, the Department",2696.693,2.57
"asked for additional time, and that will be up to the",2699.263,3.47
Intelligence Committee to grant that time.,2702.733,1.535
But they&amp;#39;re working on that.,2704.268,2.002
"The Press: And on a separate note, you",2706.27,1.635
mentioned the President&amp;#39;s call with the CEO of,2707.905,2.602
Anthem today.,2710.507,0.701
Does he have a position on Anthem&amp;#39;s effort to merge,2711.208,2.336
"with Signa, which was challenged by the Justice",2713.544,2.802
Department under President Obama?,2716.346,1.368
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t -- I&amp;#39;m not aware of that.,2717.714,2.97
I don&amp;#39;t know that that would -- that the,2720.684,1.869
President has ever expressed any personal view.,2722.553,2.302
"I think that would come under the FTC, if I&amp;#39;m",2724.855,2.469
"correct, and so I&amp;#39;d refer you to them. John.",2727.324,2.703
The Press: Just one last follow-up on Margaret&amp;#39;s,2730.027,1.601
question about Saudi.,2731.628,0.768
I know that that meeting was just finishing up when,2732.396,1.802
"you came out here, but can you give us a sense of",2734.198,2.102
what was on the agenda before they sat down?,2736.3,2.269
Mr. Spicer: I think the President had a call,2738.569,3.436
"earlier with the King, a couple weeks back.",2742.005,2.369
"I think they talked about safe havens in Syria, they",2744.374,4.572
talked about the threat of ISIS.,2748.946,2.135
I would expect all of those came up.,2751.081,2.569
"But again, I think -- I will provide a readout to",2753.65,3.137
"you all, to everyone in the pool, about what",2756.787,1.802
happened that will more clearly define that.,2758.589,2.836
John Gizzi.,2761.425,0.667
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",2762.092,1.502
Coming up in the rest of the year are four special,2763.594,4.838
elections for the U.S.,2768.432,1.735
"House of Representatives, all of which are sure to",2770.167,3.003
draw national attention as venues for debate on the,2773.17,4.771
American Health Care Act.,2777.941,1.502
Does the President plan to be involved on behalf of,2779.443,3.737
the Republican candidates and perhaps appear on,2783.18,2.602
their behalf of the districts as this may well,2785.782,3.337
be a barometer of where people feel about the,2789.119,3.37
American Health Care Act?,2792.489,1.502
Mr. Spicer: You&amp;#39;re also going to have elections in,2793.991,2.202
"Virginia and New Jersey, as far as I&amp;#39;m aware.",2796.193,1.702
And I think that as we get further into the schedule,2797.895,4.904
"and get closer to elections, we&amp;#39;ll obviously",2802.799,2.002
entertain requests from candidates at a variety of,2804.801,4.205
-- level to gauge the President&amp;#39;s support.,2809.006,2.369
So he&amp;#39;s been very supportive of candidates,2811.375,2.402
in the last cycle.,2813.777,1.001
I don&amp;#39;t see him not being -- continued support of,2814.778,2.436
people that want to fight hard for the agenda.,2817.214,2.836
"We&amp;#39;re not at that point yet, so I can probably",2820.05,3.704
give you more at some point as we move closer,2823.754,1.501
to the elections.,2825.255,0.701
But in a lot of those cases it&amp;#39;s going to be,2825.956,1.468
dependent on whether or not there&amp;#39;s a request from,2827.424,2.002
the candidate or not. Julie.,2829.426,0.734
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",2830.16,1.468
You said earlier that the White House doesn&amp;#39;t have,2831.628,1.869
projections on how many people will lose coverage.,2833.497,2.102
Is that a projection that hasn&amp;#39;t been made yet?,2835.599,2.402
Are you saying that the White House is not going,2838.001,2.636
to come out with those numbers?,2840.637,1.569
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s not something that OMB does.,2842.206,2.135
The Press: But if you&amp;#39;re advocating for a plan that,2844.341,2.636
"you say the President wants to cover everyone,",2846.977,2.102
how are you going to be able to assess whether,2849.079,2.636
you&amp;#39;ve been successful if you&amp;#39;re not going to,2851.715,2.135
"project that yourself and CBO&amp;#39;s projections, you&amp;#39;re",2853.85,1.836
"saying, are invalid?",2855.686,0.8
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think that if you look at what",2856.486,2.903
"the goal is, which is to make healthcare available",2859.389,2.369
"to every American -- as I said, I mean, you have a",2861.758,2.837
choice right now that&amp;#39;s either we support a,2864.595,2.235
failing system that there is no choice and that the,2866.83,2.636
"premiums are going up, or you provide them with a",2869.466,2.069
"system that we&amp;#39;re looking at, which does address the",2871.535,3.437
"30 million people -- it gives them a tax credit,",2874.972,2.102
it gives them great choice.,2877.074,1.168
And one of the issues that I have with a lot of the,2878.242,2.302
models that I see around is they&amp;#39;re very static;,2880.544,2.002
they talk about this prong only.,2882.546,2.302
I think when you look at the subsidy and the cost,2884.848,4.238
"of a current plan right now, without looking at",2889.086,3.136
prong two and three and how those will,2892.222,1.568
"additionally drive down cost, that it&amp;#39;s not a fair",2893.79,4.038
analysis of where the plan is going.,2897.828,2.669
But there&amp;#39;s no question that right now there is --,2900.497,3.337
"I detailed it to Jim -- I mean, we have a system",2903.834,4.304
that mandates that people buy health insurance under,2908.138,3.37
"penalty of law, and it&amp;#39;s not working.",2911.508,2.136
"And so the question is, what can we do instead and",2913.644,3.87
what can we replace that with that gives people,2917.514,1.769
greater choice and lowers cost.,2919.283,1.067
"I think in most cases, of course some people are",2920.35,2.436
always going to choose in a free society to not,2922.786,2.236
"purchase something -- I mean, we live in a country",2925.022,1.701
"of 320 million people -- at some point, you can&amp;#39;t",2926.723,3.17
force a product or a good down people,2929.893,1.869
in a free society.,2931.762,1.167
But I think if you can give them a quality,2932.929,1.902
"product that serves their needs, that they have the",2934.831,2.603
"time, at a price that they can afford, there&amp;#39;s a",2937.434,2.769
greater likelihood under every economic model that,2940.203,2.603
that suggests that that will work.,2942.806,1.668
"So I think it&amp;#39;s, frankly, economics 101 and basic",2944.474,3.07
common sense that dictate that the more competition,2947.544,3.203
and the more choice that we institute in the,2950.747,1.669
"system, the greater likelihood of more and",2952.416,2.035
more Americans getting healthcare is something,2954.451,2.603
that is easy. John.,2957.054,1.001
"The Press: Thanks a lot, Sean.",2958.055,1.434
I want to ask you about the American Health Care,2959.489,1.902
"Act, but I want to first see if you have an answer",2961.391,3.103
"to a question that I asked you yesterday, and that",2964.494,3.27
"was one that you did not know the full answer to,",2967.764,3.537
about whether there are repercussions for,2971.301,1.969
violations of that five-year lobbying ban.,2973.27,1.935
"Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sorry, I do owe you an",2975.205,2.102
explanation on that.,2977.307,1.135
I will check with Counsel and get back to you.,2978.442,1.368
The Press: Okay.,2979.81,0.667
"And then on the American Health Care Act, you use",2980.477,2.936
language very similar to language that House,2983.413,2.369
Speaker Paul Ryan used about why Republicans,2985.782,2.77
should support this legislation.,2988.552,1.568
You talked about this binary choice -- it&amp;#39;s,2990.12,3.136
either this particular legislation,2993.256,2.269
or it&amp;#39;s Obamacare.,2995.525,1.602
You have Republicans in control of the House and,2997.127,2.836
"the Senate, you have President Trump",2999.963,1.769
in the White House.,3001.732,1.234
Why do they have to vote on this particular bill?,3002.966,1.935
"Why can&amp;#39;t they negotiate for something that, for",3004.901,2.303
"instance, the Freedom Caucus thinks may be a",3007.204,2.335
better piece of legislation?,3009.539,1.168
"Mr. Spicer: Well, to get back to a question that",3010.707,2.469
"Major asked -- I mean, at the end of the day,",3013.176,1.869
whatever it is has to at least get 218 votes.,3015.045,2.669
You obviously want the greatest number of votes,3017.714,3.037
"as possible, but you need to get 218, and in the",3020.751,4.037
"case of the Senate under reconciliation,",3024.788,2.169
only 50 votes.,3026.957,1.735
But that&amp;#39;s your floor.,3028.692,1.568
And I think that what you need to do is to get,3030.26,3.07
enough members coalescing around key principles to,3033.33,2.836
get you to that floor.,3036.166,1.668
"Now, you can obviously go as high as 435 in terms",3037.834,4.305
of the ceiling.,3042.139,0.934
I&amp;#39;m not sure we&amp;#39;ll hit that.,3043.073,2.035
But the floor is what&amp;#39;s going to coalesce the,3045.108,3.971
greatest number of members around a bill that,3049.079,1.802
gets you at 218.,3050.881,0.834
"So we will continue to work with them, provide",3051.715,4.171
ideas and input.,3055.886,1.067
And regardless of what caucus or faction you&amp;#39;re a,3056.953,2.536
"part of, if you have an idea that can enhance this",3059.489,2.87
bill and make it more patient-centric and,3062.359,2.903
"achieve the goals, then we&amp;#39;re all for it.",3065.262,2.068
So that&amp;#39;s a process.,3067.33,1.302
And I think Speaker Ryan has been talking about,3068.632,3.603
this since 2010.,3072.235,1.202
"There have been a lot of ideas, a lot of debate,",3073.437,2.335
and a lot of issues put forward into,3075.772,2.202
how to craft this.,3077.974,1.168
So this has been something that&amp;#39;s been in the works,3079.142,2.036
"for seven-plus years in terms of getting members,",3081.178,2.802
"at least in the Republican conference, to coalesce",3083.98,2.703
around principles and ideas and solutions to,3086.683,2.77
make this a more patient-centric thing.,3089.453,2.469
Francesca.,3091.922,0.667
The Press: Two quick clarifications and,3092.589,2.336
then one other thing.,3094.925,0.734
It sounded like you were telling Mike to ask Paul,3095.659,3.003
Ryan about phases two and three.,3098.662,1.735
Phase two would be regulatory measures that,3100.397,2.035
the President and Secretary Price would,3102.432,1.735
be in charge of.,3104.167,1.168
When can we expect to see a list of those,3105.335,2.903
from the White House?,3108.238,1.168
Mr. Spicer: I will ask Secretary Price.,3109.406,2.002
I know that he mentioned yesterday when he came out,3111.408,2.903
"to talk to folks after the score, that his office was",3114.311,2.903
working on that.,3117.214,1.201
"I&amp;#39;ll be glad to see if we have a timeline on that,",3118.415,3.47
and then follow up with you on that.,3121.885,1.335
"The Press: And also, it sounded like you were",3123.22,1.534
saying that the White House is confident that,3124.754,1.936
you&amp;#39;ll get to 60 votes on those things in phase,3126.69,2.736
"three, those measures that conservatives have",3129.426,1.668
been asking for.,3131.094,1.001
Is the White House confident about,3132.095,1.335
the 60 votes?,3133.43,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Yes.,3134.097,0.667
The Press: Okay.,3134.764,0.701
"And then the final thing is, it&amp;#39;s also on",3135.465,3.67
healthcare as well.,3139.135,1.769
"Yesterday, Secretary Price said that he wasn&amp;#39;t saying",3140.904,2.603
to disregard the CBO report completely.,3143.507,2.802
But that sounds like what the administration is,3146.309,2.203
arguing and what you&amp;#39;re arguing as well,3148.512,2.068
from the podium.,3150.58,0.668
You said that the CBO coverage estimates are,3151.248,2.802
consistently wrong --,3154.05,1.035
Mr. Spicer: Yeah.,3155.085,0.934
The Press: -- and you&amp;#39;ve questioned their,3156.019,1.568
credibility from here.,3157.587,0.834
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, no, just to be clear, CBO is",3158.421,2.937
a budget office.,3161.358,1.601
They look at impacts on the federal budget.,3162.959,2.703
"That is why they were created, and that&amp;#39;s",3165.662,1.635
what they do.,3167.297,1.301
And I think to look at them in terms of their,3168.598,2.136
budget numbers is one thing; that&amp;#39;s their job.,3170.734,2.369
"And I think on the aspect of budget impact, it",3173.103,3.236
talked about how while we currently see a 25 percent,3176.339,3.17
increase in premiums this year under Obamacare and,3179.509,2.936
"the individual market, it markedly shows that under",3182.445,2.77
"the current American Health Care Act, there",3185.215,2.202
will be a 10 percent decline in premium.,3187.417,2.336
Where I think the CBO has gotten it wrong -- and,3189.753,2.335
it&amp;#39;s not a question of what we characterize it,3192.088,3.17
"as; it&amp;#39;s a fact -- the CBO, when it tried to",3195.258,2.703
"project people and coverage, was over 50",3197.961,3.203
percent wrong the last time.,3201.164,1.435
And the point that I think we&amp;#39;re trying to make is,3202.599,2.169
that when you look at their record and you say,3204.768,2.636
the last time they did this they were off by more,3207.404,2.002
than 50 percent -- they projected 24 million who,3209.406,3.57
would be covered by Obamacare in the exchanges,3212.976,2.569
"in 2016; in fact, that number was initially 10.4",3215.545,3.404
and it&amp;#39;s dropping.,3218.949,1.234
And so the question that you have to ask yourself,3220.183,2.102
"is, if you&amp;#39;re using that as a gauge to determine",3222.285,3.237
"our vote, you need to question whether or not",3225.522,2.636
they do counting people,3228.158,2.002
like they do counting numbers.,3230.16,1.334
"I think on the budget thing, that&amp;#39;s what their",3231.494,1.936
"wheelhouse is for, that&amp;#39;s what they do -- they count",3233.43,2.836
budget -- they look at,3236.266,1.034
budgetary impact on things.,3237.3,1.869
"When they have come to counting people, they&amp;#39;ve",3239.169,2.335
been wrong and vastly so.,3241.504,1.602
And I think it&amp;#39;s important for people to understand,3243.106,2.469
that context in which those numbers,3245.575,1.468
are given to you.,3247.043,1.001
And I think that&amp;#39;s something that I just want,3248.044,1.602
to make sure of. Jordan.,3249.646,0.767
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",3250.413,1.235
I asked you yesterday about the President&amp;#39;s,3251.648,1.435
response to Steve King.,3253.083,1.868
Do you have anything on that?,3254.951,1.201
Mr. Spicer: I think the President believes that,3256.152,3.404
this is not a point of view that he shares.,3259.556,3.203
He believes he&amp;#39;s the President for all,3262.759,1.435
"Americans, and so I&amp;#39;ll leave it at that. Jim.",3264.194,2.469
The Press: Reports surfaced Friday that the,3266.663,2.569
President will support primary challengers to,3269.232,4.138
conservative lawmakers who don&amp;#39;t support the final,3273.37,2.569
version of the American Health Care Act.,3275.939,2.369
Can you confirm that report?,3278.308,1.702
"And if it&amp;#39;s true, can you offer us insight into what",3280.01,2.736
the President is looking for in congressional,3282.746,2.302
candidates in 2018?,3285.048,1.068
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to -- I don&amp;#39;t have,3286.116,2.202
anything for you on that.,3288.318,1.101
Veronica.,3289.419,0.667
"The Press: Sean, it&amp;#39;s Ronica.",3290.086,1.602
Mr. Spicer: Ronica.,3291.688,1.401
The Press: I&amp;#39;m sorry.,3293.089,0.834
"Mr. Spicer: No, I&amp;#39;m sorry.",3293.923,1.001
"The Press: If we fix it now, we get it done.",3294.924,2.636
"Okay, two questions.",3297.56,0.701
The first one: Does the President believe that he,3298.261,2.136
was surveilled through,3300.397,0.7
microwaves and televisions?,3301.097,0.701
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to -- I will just say the,3301.798,2.469
President has tweeted about this.,3304.267,1.769
He&amp;#39;s pretty clear that he believes that there was,3306.036,1.801
surveillance that was conducted during the 2016,3307.837,2.269
"election, and we&amp;#39;re going to wait for the",3310.106,1.402
conclusion of that.,3311.508,1.668
I think there&amp;#39;s pretty sound evidence that has,3313.176,2.236
been -- that the microwave is not a sound way of,3315.412,3.503
surveilling someone.,3318.915,0.667
And I think that has been cleaned up.,3319.582,1.569
It was made in jest.,3321.151,0.867
So I think we can put that to rest.,3322.018,1.502
The Press: Okay.,3323.52,0.7
Second question.,3324.22,0.668
Newt Gingrich said that the COB [sic],3324.888,1.802
should be abolished.,3326.69,0.834
"You&amp;#39;re saying some pretty harsh words against parts,",3327.524,2.202
aspects of the COB.,3329.726,1.101
Would the President agree with that?,3330.827,1.668
Mr. Spicer: CBO.,3332.495,0.834
"The Press: Oh, excuse me.",3333.329,1.369
"Mr. Spicer: No, I got it wrong with you.",3334.698,2.435
So now we&amp;#39;re even.,3337.133,0.868
(Laughter.),3338.001,0.667
"But look, that&amp;#39;s -- Speaker Gingrich obviously",3338.668,3.904
-- I&amp;#39;ll let him comment on the House.,3342.572,3.604
CBO was established I think in the Budget,3346.176,1.768
Act from 1974.,3347.944,1.068
It&amp;#39;s up to members to decide on the House and,3349.012,2.169
Senate whether or not they want to go through this.,3351.181,2.068
"We&amp;#39;ve got OMB, they&amp;#39;ve got CBO.",3353.249,1.969
I&amp;#39;m not going to get in the business of telling,3355.218,1.668
the House who their scorekeeper should be,3356.886,1.969
in the House. Cecilia.,3358.855,0.734
"The Press: Sean, just quickly, I wanted to",3359.589,1.401
circle back on something.,3360.99,0.668
"You started to answer it, but apologies if you did.",3361.658,1.735
"I want to clarify, though.",3363.393,1.101
Can you stand here today and say that the President,3364.494,2.536
will keep his promise of insurance for everybody?,3367.03,1.968
Mr. Spicer: I think the President&amp;#39;s goal is to,3368.998,1.936
provide insurance -- to make insurance available,3370.934,2.169
"to everybody, yes.",3373.103,0.867
That&amp;#39;s what he intends to do.,3373.97,1.602
I think that is -- the goal of this is to make,3375.572,2.169
sure that every American has the choice and a plan,3377.741,3.203
that they can afford and that they have,3380.944,3.27
the choice to buy.,3384.214,1.902
And that&amp;#39;s not what they have now.,3386.116,1.801
"The Press: Sean, thanks very much.",3387.917,3.537
I wonder if the White House has a view on,3391.454,3.103
reports from Bloomberg that Jared Kushner&amp;#39;s,3394.557,2.57
family stands to gain around half a billion,3397.127,2.435
dollars from a real estate deal with Anbang,3399.562,2.436
"Corporation, which is linked to the Chinese",3401.998,2.102
"government, or has been linked to the Chinese",3404.1,2.436
government in the past.,3406.536,1.235
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t.,3407.771,1.167
"I mean, I&amp;#39;d leave that -- I&amp;#39;d refer you back to the",3408.938,1.969
Kushner companies to talk about their entities.,3410.907,2.402
"Jared went through extraordinary lengths, as",3413.309,2.002
"you all know, and we provided a lot of",3415.311,1.335
"documentation on this, to make sure that he --",3416.646,1.368
although he&amp;#39;s not taking a salary here -- that he,3418.014,1.335
"complied as if he was an employee, and went through",3419.349,1.334
extraordinary lengths to make sure that he,3420.683,1.335
de-conflicted himself and worked through the Office,3422.018,1.335
of Government Ethics.,3423.353,1.635
The Press: Is Jared currently working on,3424.988,4.304
preparations for Xi Jinping&amp;#39;s visit,3429.292,3.07
to Mar-a-Lago?,3432.362,1.234
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sure he&amp;#39;s involved in a,3433.596,4.872
lot of stuff.,3438.468,1.868
I don&amp;#39;t know specifically who&amp;#39;s involved,3440.336,3.671
in that visit.,3444.007,1.835
"The Press: Sean, you did just say that the",3445.842,2.502
President still stands by making sure that insurance,3448.344,2.77
can be afforded by everyone.,3451.114,2.102
What&amp;#39;s your specific response to the CBO&amp;#39;s,3453.216,3.003
"estimate that for someone who&amp;#39;s 64 years old, making",3456.219,3.804
"$26,000, that right now, under current law, they",3460.023,3.403
"would shell out $1,700 in a premium, but under this",3463.426,4.271
"change, the premium would go up from",3467.697,2.97
"$1,700 to $14,600?",3470.667,1.501
"What&amp;#39;s the message to a 54-year-old, who, 10 years",3472.168,2.536
"from now, faces that?",3474.704,0.801
"Mr. Spicer: I think that, again, I would go back to",3475.505,1.802
the fact that I don&amp;#39;t think that that analysis,3477.307,2.369
takes into consideration the choice that they have.,3479.676,2.469
"Part of the problem right now, Steve, is a",3482.145,2.769
54-year-old doesn&amp;#39;t need certain things.,3484.914,2.069
"They don&amp;#39;t need maternity care, they don&amp;#39;t need",3486.983,2.336
certain medical services that are being provided to,3489.319,2.969
them by this government product that is being,3492.288,2.57
forced on them right now.,3494.858,1.568
"So, number one, you have a product that is being",3496.426,2.169
"served up to older Americans, middle-aged",3498.595,2.469
"Americans, or younger Americans that doesn&amp;#39;t fit",3501.064,2.836
where they are in life and the services,3503.9,1.702
that they need.,3505.602,1.001
"And so, number one, having more choice and the",3506.603,2.602
ability to tailor a plan towards the needs that an,3509.205,2.67
"individual has depending on their stage of life,",3511.875,2.469
"whether it&amp;#39;s an individual or a family, number one.",3514.344,2.936
"Number two, that they don&amp;#39;t have",3517.28,2.269
any competition.,3519.549,0.867
"So when you combine both of those things together,",3520.416,3.17
I think that number goes way down.,3523.586,2.036
And then the third is that they can have whatever,3525.622,2.569
"subsidy they want now, but on the exchange, in many",3528.191,2.769
"cases, again, they&amp;#39;re getting a subsidy to a",3530.96,2.136
plan that has a very high deductible so that they,3533.096,2.836
have a card but not care.,3535.932,2.102
"And that is, again, not an apples-to-apples way to",3538.034,3.67
examine the current plans.,3541.704,1.502
And that&amp;#39;s what this really all comes down to.,3543.206,2.402
"The Press: So the message then is, wait until phases",3545.608,3.337
"two and three come in, and then we&amp;#39;ll",3548.945,1.768
have something better?,3550.713,0.868
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, I mean, I think -- it&amp;#39;s not just",3551.581,1.401
"wait, it&amp;#39;s that you have to look at the totality of",3552.982,2.236
what we&amp;#39;re doing to understand how this is,3555.218,2.669
going to impact the plan.,3557.887,0.901
"But right now, in the scenario that you&amp;#39;re",3558.788,2.269
"giving, a 54-year-old doesn&amp;#39;t have choice, is",3561.057,2.569
buying a plan that they don&amp;#39;t want or need for the,3563.626,1.735
"most part, and has a subsidy that&amp;#39;s probably",3565.361,3.404
not giving them the ability to go see the,3568.765,2.636
doctors that they need to because their deductible,3571.401,2.602
is off the chart.,3574.003,0.668
And that&amp;#39;s one thing that&amp;#39;s missing in a lot of,3574.671,1.701
"these discussions, is that you can have a premium for",3576.372,3.07
"month, but if your deductible is",3579.442,1.835
"skyrocketing, then, again, you might be able to get",3581.277,4.672
"an appointment, but you&amp;#39;re not getting care. Sharon.",3585.949,2.602
"The Press: Oh, Cheryl. Thanks.",3588.551,1.735
Mr. Spicer: Cheryl.,3590.286,1.035
I&amp;#39;m not good on this side.,3591.321,2.102
(Laughter.),3593.423,0.667
The Press: The budget is coming,3594.09,1.368
"out Thursday, and I&amp;#39;m just trying to find out how",3595.458,3.17
detailed is that going to be.,3598.628,1.868
"Are you going to be giving agency levels,",3600.496,1.702
program levels?,3602.198,0.667
Or are we going to see what programs are going to,3602.865,2.67
be eliminated in the budget?,3605.535,1.268
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;ll let Director Mulvaney -- he&amp;#39;s,3606.803,2.302
going to have an entire presentation.,3609.105,1.368
I know they&amp;#39;ll start background briefings,3610.473,1.602
tomorrow for you all.,3612.075,1.768
They&amp;#39;ll walk through different aspects,3613.843,1.335
of the budget.,3615.178,0.801
I don&amp;#39;t want to get ahead of him on this.,3615.979,1.401
So let&amp;#39;s figure out where we go first on this with,3617.38,6.573
"what he has, and then we&amp;#39;ll have a full",3623.953,3.604
presentation on Thursday.,3627.557,1.134
The Press: Can you just say if the infrastructure,3628.691,2.536
"plan is going to be part of that, or is that",3631.227,2.836
going to be later?,3634.063,1.101
"Mr. Spicer: No, that&amp;#39;s separate.",3635.164,1.335
That is separate. Gabi.,3636.499,1.101
The Press: Thanks.,3637.6,0.834
I have two questions.,3638.434,1.068
"The first one: The President, one of his",3639.502,2.202
signature campaign promises on immigration,3641.704,1.368
was to pursue HB-1 visa reform.,3643.072,1.635
"And on April 1st, the United States will begin",3644.707,2.436
accepting new HB-1 visa applications.,3647.143,1.368
Can we expect to see any movement on,3648.511,2.169
that before then?,3650.68,0.834
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s a good question.,3651.514,1.869
I don&amp;#39;t -- I think -- we&amp;#39;ve talked about,3653.383,1.768
immigration in the past.,3655.151,0.934
I think there is an entire comprehensive process,3656.085,2.469
that&amp;#39;s being looked at in terms of how we&amp;#39;re,3658.554,2.937
preventing illegal immigration and then what,3661.491,2.469
"we&amp;#39;re doing about legal immigration, whether it&amp;#39;s",3663.96,1.568
H1-Bs or K1 or other visas that exist,3665.528,2.97
within the system.,3668.498,0.667
There is an entire look that is being taken with,3669.165,3.103
respect to the visa program.,3672.268,1.869
And we will have more for you as we get,3674.137,3.67
through the system.,3677.807,1.168
"Thank you, guys, very much.",3678.975,1.034
We&amp;#39;re headed off to Detroit and,3680.009,2.169
Nashville tomorrow.,3682.178,0.801
"If you&amp;#39;re not on the trip, we look forward to -- I",3682.979,2.736
hope everyone wears their green on,3685.715,1.368
Thursday and Friday.,3687.083,1.168
You got a double shot at it this year,3688.251,2.302
because of the visit.,3690.553,0.667
So thank you.,3691.22,0.701
Stay safe on the roads.,3691.921,1.335
The Press: How are you all going to do the,3693.256,6.64
background briefings?,3699.896,1.334
Mr. Spicer: Right here.,3701.23,2.67
