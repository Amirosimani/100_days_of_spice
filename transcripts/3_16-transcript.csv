"Sorry for the delay, guys.",8.942,1.101
It&amp;#39;s budget day.,10.043,0.967
I was supposed to kick this off with,15.048,1.802
Director Mulvaney.,16.85,1.401
"He&amp;#39;s still on a call with the governors, and",18.251,2.236
continues to host a ton of briefings today with,20.487,2.836
key stakeholders.,23.323,0.901
"And so my goal, if this times out right, is that",24.224,3.103
"as we finish up, Director Mulvaney will walk in the",27.327,2.302
"room, right on cue, and then he will talk to you a",29.629,3.137
"little bit about the budget, and we&amp;#39;ll walk",32.766,2.302

"you, Director Mulvaney.&amp;quot;",41.274,0.968
(Laughter.),42.242,2.502

blueprint keeps his promise to put America&amp;#39;s,47.647,1.702

former Senator Dan Coats as the next Director of,105.205,2.802
National Intelligence in his ceremonial office.,108.007,3.404

deep subject -- the subject matter expertise,113.546,2.77

"legislation that reforms our healthcare, making it",281.814,3.003
affordable and accessible to every American.,284.817,3.103
Since we won&amp;#39;t have a chance to meet tomorrow in,287.92,1.769
light of the President and Chancellor Merkel&amp;#39;s press,289.689,2.602
"conference, I wanted to quickly walk you through a",292.291,2.236

roundtable focusing on the importance of vocational,309.442,3.203

Secretary Shulkin and representatives from the,328.361,2.369
various Veterans Service Organizations.,330.73,2.836
It&amp;#39;s incredibly important to the President that we,333.566,1.869
reform the VA system so that it can fulfill the,335.435,2.402
promises made to the men and women who risked their,337.837,2.803

The President looks forward to welcoming,366.833,1.601
[them] for what he hopes,368.434,0.701
will be a productive discussion.,369.135,1.868
And I also want to remind everyone that -- I did,371.003,1.936
"yesterday, via Twitter -- that the lottery for the",372.939,2.836
139th Annual White House Easter Egg Roll is open,375.775,3.203
until Saturday -- this coming Saturday.,378.978,3.403
Everyone who is interested in attending can go,382.381,2.67
to Recreation.gov.,385.051,1.735
Further information is at WhiteHouse.gov,386.786,1.868
for details.,388.654,1.368
"At his rally last night, the President addressed",390.022,1.836
the decision by the federal district court in,391.858,3.069
Hawaii to block his lawful executive order.,394.927,4.672
"As the President said last night, &amp;quot;The law and the",399.599,2.435
Constitution give the President the power to,402.034,3.537
suspend immigration when he deems it to be,405.571,2.036
necessary in the national interest...&amp;quot;,407.607,2.369
The Court didn&amp;#39;t even bother to quote the,409.976,1.968
"relevant statute in its opinion, which could have",411.944,2.97
plainly shown that the President clearly,414.914,1.702
has this authority.,416.616,1.368
"I know you&amp;#39;ve heard it before, but since the",417.984,1.701
"Court didn&amp;#39;t, let me quote it again for you.",419.685,2.169
8 U.S. Code 1182 states: &amp;quot;Whenever the President,421.854,3.804
finds [that] the entry of any aliens or of any class,425.658,3.67
of aliens into the United States would be,429.328,2.937
detrimental to the interests of the United,432.265,1.935
"States, he may by proclamation, and for such",434.2,3.303
"period as he [shall] deem necessary, suspend the",437.503,3.037
entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as,440.54,3.803
"immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose",444.343,2.937
on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem,447.28,5.038
[to be] appropriate.&amp;quot;,452.318,0.667
The Department of Justice said in a statement that,452.985,1.936
they &amp;quot;strongly disagree[s] with the federal district,454.921,2.469
"court&amp;#39;s ruling, which is flawed both in reasoning",457.39,1.334
and [in] scope.&amp;quot;,458.724,0.668
"DOJ continued, &amp;quot;The President&amp;#39;s executive",459.392,1.334
order falls squarely within his lawful,460.726,1.335
authority in seeking to protect our nation&amp;#39;s,462.061,1.335
"security, and the Department will continue",463.396,1.368
to defend this executive order in the courts.&amp;quot;,464.764,1.334
The Department is exploring all available,466.098,6.407
options to vigorously,472.505,6.606
defend this executive order.,479.111,1.736
We intend to appeal the flawed rulings.,480.847,2.469
"Currently, the Department of Justice is determining",483.316,2.102
the legal strategy and timing.,485.418,1.968
We expect action to be taken soon to appeal the,487.386,2.169
ruling in the 4th Circuit and to seek clarification,489.555,2.67
of the order prior to appeal in the 9th Circuit.,492.225,3.203
"The danger is real, and the law is clear.",495.428,3.203
The President was elected to change our broken,498.631,1.868
"immigration system, and he will continue to exercise",500.499,2.737
his constitutional authority and presidential,503.236,2.402
responsibility to protect our nation.,505.638,2.97
"And just before I get to your questions, and then",508.608,2.202
"before we&amp;#39;ll introduce Director Mulvaney, I just",510.81,2.302
wanted to follow up on a couple of questions that,513.112,1.702
have come up recently.,514.814,1.501
Jon Decker asked multiple times on the enforcement,516.315,2.269
of the President&amp;#39;s executive order to,518.584,1.835
restrict lobbying activities of executive,520.419,2.336
"branch employees, which includes a five-year ban",522.755,2.769
on lobbying agencies where you&amp;#39;ve served and a,525.524,2.336
lifetime ban on lobbying from foreign governments.,527.86,2.269
"I said I&amp;#39;d get back to Jon, so here we go.",530.129,2.669
"The executive order itself has a section, Section 5,",532.798,3.37
which focuses on enforcement.,536.168,1.769
The order outlines that each agency head is tasked,537.937,2.536
with working with the Office of Government,540.473,1.334
Ethics to establish procedures for determining,541.807,2.47
potential violations of the ethics pledge.,544.277,2.969
"Should a violation be determined, the executive",547.246,2.503
order authorizes the Department of Justice to,549.749,2.068
enforce the order through several mechanisms:,551.817,2.803
debarment proceedings -- these would restrict an,554.62,1.902
individual or his or her associated entities from,556.522,2.669
doing business with the federal government;,559.191,2.169
"seeking an injunction, such as a restraining",561.36,2.136
order from lobbying for 10 years -- the five years in,563.496,2.669
the ethics agreement plus an additional five years;,566.165,2.002
or civil penalties such as a fine commensurate with,568.167,2.903
the nature of the violation.,571.07,1.668
The President fully expects the Department of,572.738,1.835
Justice to vigorously enforce this executive order.,574.573,3.771
Also yesterday several of you asked where the House,578.344,2.069
is in regard to additional legislation as outlined in,580.413,3.47
the third prong of the AHCA and the President&amp;#39;s,583.883,2.702
plan to reform healthcare.,586.585,2.103
I&amp;#39;m pleased to note that last night Leader McCarthy,588.688,3.97
in the House introduced four pieces of legislation,592.658,2.67
"that will remove burdensome regulations,",595.328,2.002
"lower costs, and increase access as we&amp;#39;ve noted: the",597.33,3.403
"Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act, H.R.",600.733,2.603
"372, which eliminates anti-trust protection for",603.336,3.637
"an insurance provider, creating competition so",606.973,2.335
that Americans are not left with just one choice,609.308,2.469
for healthcare coverage; the Small Business Health,611.777,2.503
"Fairness Act, H.R.",614.28,1.034
"1101, which allows small businesses to band",615.314,3.404
together and negotiate lower prices; the,618.718,2.669
"Protecting Access to Care Act, H.R.",621.387,2.369
"1215, which limits frivolous lawsuits that",623.756,3.136
unnecessarily drive up healthcare costs; and the,626.892,2.603
"Self-Insurance Protection Act, H.R.",629.495,1.902
"1304, which protects workers who get their",631.397,2.803
healthcare coverage from employers that self-insure,634.2,2.536
by providing a backstop on catastrophic losses.,636.736,2.836
"And finally, in terms of following up from",639.572,1.835
"yesterday, in regard to the DOJ&amp;#39;s indictments of",641.407,3.437
"Russian hackers on Yahoo data, this action",644.844,2.569
demonstrates the United States&amp;#39; commitment to,647.413,1.668
identifying cyber criminals and bringing,649.081,2.169
"them to justice, no matter where they are.",651.25,2.035
It also highlights the criminal importance of,653.285,1.869
international cooperation to our cyber regime.,655.154,3.604
"And like I said, yesterday, though this is",658.758,2.068
"a lawful enforcement action, anything beyond",660.826,2.303
"that, I would direct you to the Department of",663.129,1.935
Justice and the FBI for further details.,665.064,2.669
"Before I continue, let me turn it over to Director",667.733,2.603
Mulvaney to talk a little bit about the budget.,670.336,1.968
Director?,672.304,1.469
Director Mulvaney: Thanks very much.,673.773,3.47
"Good afternoon, and happy day before St. Patrick&amp;#39;s",677.243,3.136
"Day, also known as Budget Day.",680.379,1.535
Most of you heard me talk about the budget before so,681.914,2.269
I&amp;#39;m not going to say too many things in opening,684.183,2.069
before we get to your questions.,686.252,1.334
But we will remind you that this is what we&amp;#39;re,687.586,1.969
calling the America First Budget.,689.555,1.368
We had an America First candidate; you now have an,690.923,4.004
America First President.,694.927,1.602
And it shouldn&amp;#39;t surprise anybody that we have an,696.529,1.668
America First Budget.,698.197,1.401
"It&amp;#39;s in the details, as we talked about last week --",699.598,2.603
$54 billion of additional defense spending.,702.201,2.402
We have some more details today on where that,704.603,1.469
money is going.,706.072,1.801
"We&amp;#39;re seeing increases at the VA, increases within",707.873,3.404
"the Department of Justice for law enforcement,",711.277,1.835
increases within the Department of Homeland,713.112,1.702
Security for things that include border security,714.814,3.069
and immigration controls.,717.883,1.468
Immigration is within -- excuse me -- increases,719.351,2.737
within the Department of Energy to deal with,722.088,2.202
a nuclear triad.,724.29,1.001
And then corresponding reductions in similar,725.291,2.269
amounts offsetting dollar,727.56,1.902
for dollar in other programs.,729.462,2.869
The largest reduction if you&amp;#39;ve seen the budget,732.331,2.369
already is a 31 percent reduction within the,734.7,2.269
Environmental Protection Agency.,736.969,1.735
The next largest reduction on a percentage basis is,738.704,2.336
within Department of State; and the other,741.04,1.935
departments are reduced in lesser amounts.,742.975,3.337
"I think the smallest reduction we have is NASA,",746.312,2.502
which is just less than 1 percent.,748.814,1.802
"But there again, as with many of the agencies,",750.616,1.835
you&amp;#39;ll see certain line items within those,752.451,1.969
budgets plussed up.,754.42,2.235
This is the message the President wanted to send,756.655,2.369
"to the public, to the press, to Capitol Hill: he",759.024,3.304
wants more money for defense; more money for,762.328,2.068
border enforcement; more money for law enforcement,764.396,2.036
generally; more money for the vets; more money,766.432,2.769
for school choice.,769.201,1.235
And then to offset that money with savings,770.436,2.869
elsewhere so that all of that is done without an,773.305,2.169
additional dollar added to the deficit.,775.474,1.969
"As I&amp;#39;ve mentioned before, the budget does not",777.443,2.803
balance the budget.,780.246,1.001
This budget simply reallocates and,781.247,2.269
reprioritizes spending as any family or business,783.516,3.87
would do.,787.386,1.135
This budget does not -- for those of you who were,788.521,1.901
not here last week -- this budget does not address,790.422,3.304
"the big-picture items such as policy changes, revenue",793.726,3.236
"flows, tax policy, mandatory spending.",796.962,3.17
This is simply the topline spending budget.,800.132,2.269
"That&amp;#39;s why we call it the budget blueprint, and",802.401,2.803
not the full budget.,805.204,0.767
"That full budget, which will contain all the rest",805.971,1.936
"of those pieces and parts, will be released in May.",807.907,5.872
"Before I take questions, I&amp;#39;m going to do something",813.779,1.435
I don&amp;#39;t ordinarily do -- I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;s kind of new,815.214,2.002
-- I&amp;#39;m going to call on the New York Times because,817.216,2.669
they&amp;#39;re in trouble.,819.885,1.368
"Apparently, is there a -- where&amp;#39;s my",821.253,2.002
New York Times guy?,823.255,1.835
"Matt Flegenheimer and Alan Rappeport -- okay,",825.09,3.871
are in big trouble.,828.961,1.068
I&amp;#39;ll give you the first question but you have to,830.029,1.334
deliver this message to them.,831.363,1.068
They printed this morning that I am the father of,832.431,1.502
17-year-old triplet girls.,833.933,2.202
My 17-year-old daughter really wishes that were,836.135,2.302
"happy -- really wishes that had happened, but my",838.437,2.569
two 17-year-old sons are upset.,841.006,2.102
(Laughter.),843.108,0.668
"So if you could clarify that, that would be great.",843.776,3.737
"And I&amp;#39;ll give you the first questions,",847.513,1.435
if you&amp;#39;ve got one.,848.948,1.001
So go ahead.,849.949,1.434
"The Press: We&amp;#39;re not great at math, obviously, at the",851.383,2.036
New York Times.,853.419,0.667
"Director Mulvaney: The math is right, it&amp;#39;s",854.086,1.368
actually the gender that was wrong.,855.454,1.802
(Laughter.),857.256,0.701
"The Press: Sir, during the campaign",857.957,2.669
"President Trump, then candidate Trump, talked",860.626,2.302
"about the national debt, which of course has",862.928,2.87
reached around $20 trillion.,865.798,0.901
You mentioned it in your budget message this morning.,866.699,4.638
"Is there a plan, as the President talked about",871.337,2.135
"during last year&amp;#39;s campaign, to actually",873.472,2.069
eliminate the national debt in eight years?,875.541,1.735
He said during the campaign it would be easy,877.276,2.202
to actually eliminate the entire debt -- not the,879.478,2.169
"deficit, but the debt -- in eight years.",881.647,1.702
Is that something that this President is actually,883.349,1.968
committed to trying to do?,885.317,0.768
"Director Mulvaney: It&amp;#39;s a good question,",886.085,1.334
it&amp;#39;s a fair question.,887.419,0.668
I would just suggest to you it&amp;#39;s not the right,888.087,1.334
time for the question.,889.421,0.668
"The budget blueprint, again, does not deal with",890.089,2.335
"the debt, it even doesn&amp;#39;t deal with the deficit.",892.424,2.837
It is simply the first,895.261,0.9
part of the appropriations process.,896.161,3.07
"We&amp;#39;ll send this up to the Hill now, and the",899.231,2.036
Appropriations Committees of the House and the,901.267,2.302
Senate -- of course the House controls the power,903.569,1.568
"of the purse, the Senate -- excuse me, Congress",905.137,1.768
controls the power of the purse.,906.905,1.469
And this will be the first step in that process.,908.374,2.402
We will start to address the issues of the,910.776,2.035
"longer-term deficit, longer-term debt in",912.811,3.204
that larger budget.,916.015,0.8
And of course we&amp;#39;ll have to deal at that time with,916.815,1.502
"things like mandatory spending, tax policy,",918.317,2.269
revenue flows to the government.,920.586,1.968
"So again, it&amp;#39;s a fair question, I just don&amp;#39;t",922.554,1.368
think now is the time to ask the question.,923.922,1.335
The Press: The 28 percent that comes out of the,925.257,2.603
"State Department, I know that you&amp;#39;re leaving a lot",927.86,1.802
of discretion to the people who are in charge,929.662,2.435
there at all of these agencies for how to,932.097,1.869
implement these cuts.,933.966,0.734
But how much is intended to come out of the foreign,934.7,2.536
aid budget of that $10 billion?,937.236,2.202
Director Mulvaney: A lot of it.,939.438,2.169
"As I&amp;#39;ve said before, one of the reasons that you&amp;#39;re",941.607,2.669
seeing such a dramatic reduction in the State,944.276,1.969
Department on a percentage basis is not that this,946.245,2.803
President thinks that diplomacy is not important,949.048,2.135
"-- in fact, nothing could be further from the truth.",951.183,2.169
We&amp;#39;ve already seen that Secretary Tillerson has,953.352,1.601
had a tremendous -- one diplomatic success already,954.953,3.07
on the deal he cut with Iraq.,958.023,2.202
"The President believes in diplomacy, and we believe",960.225,2.369
that this budget protects that core function of the,962.594,3.104
State Department.,965.698,1.034
It just so happens that much of the foreign aid,966.732,3.236
that the President talked about in campaign -- much,969.968,2.036
"of the money that goes to climate research, green",972.004,3.203
"energy, those types of things -- are actually in",975.207,1.902
the State Department budget.,977.109,1.468
If those line items had been in the Department of,978.577,2.569
"Commerce, you would see Department of Commerce",981.146,1.569
having gone down by a similarly large percentage.,982.715,3.37
So the answer to your question is that most of,986.085,2.135
the cuts within the State Department try to focus,988.22,2.236
directly on foreign aid.,990.456,1.468
"Yes, sir.",991.924,0.7
"The Press: Yes, the budget showed a 0.8 decrease for",992.624,4.839
"NASA, but you&amp;#39;ve also talked about in the",997.463,2.202
administration using private companies such as,999.665,2.803
"SpaceX, for example, for more of that.",1002.468,2.102
So does this show some -- is some of this going to,1004.57,2.636
be shifted over to the private sector?,1007.206,2.169
And does this show a commitment on the,1009.375,1.334
administration&amp;#39;s part towards science and NASA?,1010.709,3.27
Director Mulvaney: I does.,1013.979,1.301
"Again, if you go back and you do what we did, which",1015.28,1.802
"is go back to the President&amp;#39;s speeches, the",1017.082,1.335
"interviews he gave and just talking to him, we",1018.417,1.501
tried to identify his priorities.,1019.918,1.602
"And one of the things he told us was, look, I&amp;#39;m",1021.52,1.735
still interested in America being involved,1023.255,2.136
in space exploration.,1025.391,1.301
So even though the overall topline number at NASA is,1026.692,3.804
reduced by a small fraction -- I think it&amp;#39;s,1030.496,1.468
"0.8 percent, as you mentioned -- individual",1031.964,2.502
line items that deal with specifically space,1034.466,2.736
exploration are actually plussed up.,1037.202,2.236
And part of the intent there is to promote,1039.438,3.403
exactly what you just talked about.,1042.841,2.269
"Yes, sir.",1045.11,0.668
The Press: Two questions.,1045.778,1.067
Your own experience in the House tells you that a lot,1046.845,2.97
of these cuts haven&amp;#39;t been voted for before.,1049.815,3.036
"Do you consider this budget an opening bid, and",1052.851,3.304
"do you expect a lot of pushback, even from",1056.155,1.835
"Republicans, on the specificity and the size",1057.99,2.502
of these cuts?,1060.492,1.035
"And secondly, to take your point about the",1061.527,1.801
"President&amp;#39;s words on the campaign, those of us who",1063.328,1.869
traveled around with him remember -- he said he,1065.197,1.868
"didn&amp;#39;t want to touch Social Security, Medicare,",1067.065,1.469
the big entitlements.,1068.534,1.134
"The fact that that&amp;#39;s not in this budget, is that a",1069.668,2.469
signal that those programs,1072.137,2.636
are going to remain untouched?,1074.773,0.868
And as the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget,1075.641,2.969
"said, that ignores 70 percent of spending and 90",1078.61,2.436
percent of its growth over the next decade.,1081.046,1.335
Director Mulvaney: I&amp;#39;ll deal with the second one,1082.381,1.334
"first, which is the President is absolutely",1083.715,1.569
going to keep the promises he kept on the campaign trail.,1085.284,3.003
"Again, you will see no reference in Social",1088.287,1.868
"Security here, no reference to Medicare",1090.155,2.336
"here, no reference to Medicaid here or any of",1092.491,2.302
the other mandatory programs -- what some,1094.793,1.735
people call entitlement programs -- because that&amp;#39;s,1096.528,1.936
not what this budget is.,1098.464,1.301
"This is the discretionary part of the budget, half",1099.765,2.469
"of which, as you know, is defense, and the other",1102.234,1.768
"half is everything else, the alphabet soup of government.",1104.002,2.837
So just because it&amp;#39;s not here doesn&amp;#39;t mean we&amp;#39;re,1106.839,2.035
dodging the issue.,1108.874,0.767
You would never see in any budget blueprint that,1109.641,2.002
deals with the topline spending numbers Social,1111.643,2.169
"Security, Medicare and Medicaid.",1113.812,1.468
To your other question about it not being popular,1115.28,1.535
"on the Hill -- yeah, I can recognize that.",1116.815,1.969
I&amp;#39;ve been on the Hill enough to know that some,1118.784,2.569
of these would be very unpopular.,1121.353,1.535
Keep in mind the President is in a unique position.,1122.888,3.07
"I&amp;#39;ve been a member of Congress, I represented",1125.958,1.835
"700,000 people in South Carolina.",1127.793,1.601
I had my constituency.,1129.394,1.402
It was a district.,1130.796,1.301
Senators represent an entire state.,1132.097,1.902
We&amp;#39;re always dealing with special interests from,1133.999,3.103
"back home, we&amp;#39;re dealing with lobbyists from back home.",1137.102,4.071
The President is beholden to none of that.,1141.173,2.402
The President has drafted a budget for the entire,1143.575,3.103
nation because that&amp;#39;s who he sees himself,1146.678,1.335
as representing.,1148.013,0.667
"He did not ask lobbyists for input on this, he did",1148.68,1.335
"not ask special interests for input on this, and he",1150.015,2.336
certainly didn&amp;#39;t focus on how these programs might,1152.351,3.103
impact a specific congressional district.,1155.454,2.969
But we knew that going into it.,1158.423,1.569
"And again, the message we&amp;#39;re sending to the Hill",1159.992,1.735
is we want more money for the things the President,1161.727,2.135
"talked about, defense being the top one,",1163.862,1.969
"national security, and we don&amp;#39;t want to add to",1165.831,2.836
the budget deficit.,1168.667,0.901
If Congress has another way to do that we&amp;#39;re happy,1169.568,1.902
to talk to them about it.,1171.47,0.801
"Yes, sir, in the glasses.",1172.271,0.834
The Press: James Bays from Al Jazeera.,1173.105,2.202
The United Nations said the world is currently,1175.307,2.402
facing the largest humanitarian crisis since,1177.709,2.469
the end of World War II -- 20 million people in just,1180.178,4.905
four countries facing starvation or famine.,1185.083,2.57
"And yet you&amp;#39;re cutting funding to the U.N.,",1187.653,2.469
cutting funding to the foreign aid budget.,1190.122,2.102
Are you worried that some of the most vulnerable,1192.224,2.669
people on Earth will suffer as a result?,1194.893,2.369
Director Mulvaney: We&amp;#39;re absolutely reducing,1197.262,2.202
funding to the U.N.,1199.464,1.168
"and to the various foreign aid programs, including",1200.632,2.469
those run by the U.N.,1203.101,1.035
and other agencies.,1204.136,1.067
That should come as a surprise to no one who,1205.203,1.569
watched the campaign.,1206.772,1.168
The President said specifically hundreds of,1207.94,2.102
time -- you covered him -- I&amp;#39;m going to spend less,1210.042,2.302
money on people overseas and more money on,1212.344,2.002
people back home.,1214.346,0.767
And that&amp;#39;s exactly what we&amp;#39;re doing,1215.113,1.335
with this budget.,1216.448,0.667
"Yes, ma&amp;#39;am.",1217.115,0.668
The Press: Given your focus on dollar-for-dollar,1217.783,3.937
"offsets in fiscal &amp;#39;18, and for your fiscal 2017",1221.72,6.607
request you didn&amp;#39;t insist on dollar-for-dollar offsets.,1228.327,2.836
Why is that?,1231.163,0.667
Why are you not concerned about adding to the,1231.83,2.636
deficit in fiscal 2017?,1234.466,1.368
Director Mulvaney: The large part of the -- the,1235.834,3.07
point -- the question deals with the 2017,1238.904,3.704
"request, which is a $30 billion -- I think it&amp;#39;s",1242.608,2.168
actually $3 billion -- a billion and a half in,1244.776,2.069
there for the wall.,1246.845,1.468
And it&amp;#39;s not entirely offset.,1248.313,1.602
There&amp;#39;s a couple reasons for that.,1249.915,1.334
One of them is time.,1251.249,1.001
Another one is that some of that is what they call,1252.25,2.77
Overseas Contingency Operations.,1255.02,1.635
"Now, you also know that I have a somewhat colored",1256.655,3.27
"history with the overseas contingency operation, but",1259.925,2.969
I will tell you that we went through this and made,1262.894,1.902
sure that the money that&amp;#39;s being requested is true,1264.796,2.336
OCO -- means that it&amp;#39;s focused truly on the areas,1267.132,3.37
"where we&amp;#39;re involved overseas, Iraq, Syria,",1270.502,2.402
"Afghanistan, those types of places.",1272.904,1.702
So we have sent them $18 billion worth of proposed,1274.606,2.202
"reductions for 2017, but not all of them are offset.",1276.808,3.571
"Yes, ma&amp;#39;am.",1280.379,0.667
The Press: The President has called for eliminating,1281.046,3.57
funding for the Corporation for Public,1284.616,2.069
Broadcast and the National Endowment for the Arts.,1286.685,2.769
If the Republican Congress sent the President,1289.454,2.503
"appropriate bills that fund CPB and NEA, will he",1291.957,4.204
veto those bills and tell the Republican leadership,1296.161,2.402
to send bill that defunds those things?,1298.563,2.036
Director Mulvaney: The message the President sent,1300.599,2.536
right now is that we want to defund those.,1303.135,2.302
And there&amp;#39;s completely defensible reasons,1305.437,2.102
for doing that.,1307.539,0.767
"It&amp;#39;s a simple message, by the way.",1308.306,1.702
I put myself in the shoes of that steelworker in,1310.008,5.472
"Ohio, the coal-mining family in West Virginia,",1315.48,3.437
"the mother of two in Detroit, and I&amp;#39;m saying,",1318.917,3.37
"okay, I have to go ask these folks for money and",1322.287,2.97
I have to tell them where I&amp;#39;m going to spend it.,1325.257,2.502
"Can I really go to those folks, look them in the",1327.759,2.236
"eye and say, look, I want to take money from you and",1329.995,2.169
I want to give it to the,1332.164,0.767
Corporation of Public Broadcasting?,1332.931,1.502
"That is a really hard sell, in fact, some of you",1334.433,1.835
don&amp;#39;t think we can defend anymore.,1336.268,1.802
"As to specific vetoes, you and I both know it doesn&amp;#39;t",1338.07,3.103
"come over one by one, line item by line item",1341.173,2.002
doesn&amp;#39;t come over.,1343.175,0.7
They come over in large appropriations bills.,1343.875,1.769
And we&amp;#39;ll work with Congress to go through the,1345.644,1.768
appropriations process and we&amp;#39;ll make determinations,1347.412,2.436
on whether or not to sign appropriations bills or,1349.848,2.402
veto them at the appropriate time.,1352.25,1.936
"Yes, sir.",1354.186,0.667
The Press: There are several cases in the,1354.853,2.636
country where you&amp;#39;re talking about eliminating,1357.489,2.336
some of these unauthorized programs.,1359.825,2.035
Are you laying down a marker there on,1361.86,1.468
"unauthorized programs, and do you think spending",1363.328,2.169
discipline would be improved if Congress,1365.497,1.902
authorized everything that it is --,1367.399,1.668
Director Mulvaney: We hope so.,1369.067,1.101
"For those of you who aren&amp;#39;t familiar with this,",1370.168,2.102
we actually spend a lot of money in the federal,1372.27,1.902
government that&amp;#39;s on programs that aren&amp;#39;t,1374.172,1.702
authorized at all.,1375.874,1.535
"Remember, spending is sort -- to break it down, it&amp;#39;s",1377.409,2.836
sort of a three-step process to spend money.,1380.245,1.768
You have to budget for it first.,1382.013,1.469
"Then you have to authorize it, and then you have to",1383.482,1.735
appropriate it.,1385.217,1.167
But a lot of the programs that we&amp;#39;ve spent money on,1386.384,3.671
for years have been unauthorized spending.,1390.055,2.769
"Either they used to be authorized -- actually,",1392.824,1.902
most of them used to be authorized and then,1394.726,1.402
they simply lapsed.,1396.128,1.067
And some of them were just never authorized,1397.195,1.335
in the first place.,1398.53,0.667
They simply were appropriated without,1399.197,1.502
any authorization.,1400.699,1.101
"And, yeah, the message is that&amp;#39;s not the",1401.8,1.735
right way to do it.,1403.535,1.468
"In fact, we think that&amp;#39;s the wrong way to do it.",1405.003,1.635
You heard the President talk specifically on the,1406.638,1.702
campaign trail about at least 5 percent reductions,1408.34,3.036
"for unauthorized programs, and that&amp;#39;s what",1411.376,1.835
generated this budget.,1413.211,1.035
The Press: Director Mulvaney talked about this,1414.246,2.168
budget basically keeping the promises that the,1416.414,1.869
President made during the course of the campaign.,1418.283,1.869
"For Housing and Urban Development, this budget",1420.152,4.104
"blueprint calls for a 13-percent reduction,",1424.256,2.736
$6 billion.,1426.992,1.201
"During the course of the campaign, President Trump",1428.193,1.668
"said, specifically to urban black voters, he",1429.861,2.403
"says, &amp;quot;What do you have to lose?",1432.264,2.035
It turns out what they have to lose is at least,1434.299,1.735
$6 billion that goes to many programs that benefit,1436.034,2.636
those communities.,1438.67,0.667
What do you say to those Americans who feel that?,1439.337,1.602
Director Mulvaney: Nobody is going to get kicked,1440.939,1.335
out of their houses.,1442.274,1.301
What we did when we looked at the HUD budget was try,1443.575,2.402
"to figure out a way to spend money better, and",1445.977,1.969
what we saw -- and I talked to Dr. Carson about,1447.946,1.735
this just today -- what we saw as we went through the,1449.681,1.969
analysis of the HUD budget is that a lot of their,1451.65,2.202
money got spent on government housing and building.,1453.852,2.602
It&amp;#39;s actually infrastructure.,1456.454,1.402
And what Senator Carson -- what Secretary Carson and,1457.856,3.403
I talked about was figure out a way to do that better.,1461.259,2.269
"And as we did that, what we realized was we are",1463.528,2.436
working on a large infrastructure program,1465.964,2.069
that we hope to roll out this summer.,1468.033,1.902
And what Secretary Carson wants to do is take the,1469.935,2.936
money for the infrastructure that&amp;#39;s in,1472.871,1.802
HUD right now -- and not very well run -- and move,1474.673,2.736
that into this larger program.,1477.409,1.468
"In fact, you&amp;#39;ll see the same line items -- or",1478.877,1.935
similar line items at the Department of,1480.812,1.335
Transportation for the same reason.,1482.147,2.202
These do not mean the President is changing his,1484.349,1.768
commitment to infrastructure.,1486.117,1.135
"Again, far from it.",1487.252,0.901
"What we&amp;#39;re saying is, look, for years and years",1488.153,2.302
we have built infrastructure like this,1490.455,1.969
and it doesn&amp;#39;t work very well -- The Press: Well --,1492.424,2.669
Director Mulvaney: Let me finish and I&amp;#39;ll,1495.093,2.469
get back to you.,1497.562,0.668
So what we&amp;#39;re doing now is we&amp;#39;re taking it out of the,1498.23,1.334
discretionary budget and we&amp;#39;re going to move it,1499.564,1.335
into the larger infrastructure plan this summer.,1500.899,1.335
The Press: Housing and Urban Development and the,1502.234,1.368
Community Development Block Grants aren&amp;#39;t,1503.602,1.334
exclusively about housing.,1504.936,1.135
"They support a variety of different programs,",1506.071,2.002
"including, in part, Meals on Wheels, that affects",1508.073,2.969
a lot of Americans.,1511.042,0.668
"In Austin, Texas today, one organization there",1511.71,2.469
that delivers those meals to thousands of elderly,1514.179,2.502
says that those citizens will no longer be able to,1516.681,2.87
be provided those meals.,1519.551,1.635
So what do you say to those Americans who are,1521.186,1.468
ultimately losing out?,1522.654,1.034
"Not on housing, but on other things that are",1523.688,1.435
taken out of that budget?,1525.123,0.667
"Director Mulvaney: As you know, or I think you know",1525.79,1.335
that Meals on Wheels is not a federal program.,1527.125,1.602
It&amp;#39;s part of that community -- the CDBG --,1528.727,2.068
the block grants that we give to the states.,1530.795,1.869
And then many states make the decision to use that,1532.664,3.27
money on Meals on Wheels.,1535.934,0.801
Here&amp;#39;s what I can tell you about CDBGs because that&amp;#39;s,1536.735,2.068
what we fund -- right?,1538.803,1.368
-- is that we spend $150 billion on those programs,1540.171,3.304
since the 1970s.,1543.475,2.536
The CDBGs have been identified as programs,1546.011,2.135
"since I believe the first -- actually, the second",1548.146,2.169
Bush administration as ones that were just not,1550.315,2.035
showing any results.,1552.35,2.369
We can&amp;#39;t do that anymore.,1554.719,1.635
We can&amp;#39;t spend money on programs just,1556.354,2.236
because they sound good.,1558.59,1.234
"And Meals on Wheels sounds great -- again, that&amp;#39;s a",1559.824,1.836
state decision to fund,1561.66,1.167
that particular portion to.,1562.827,1.435
But to take the federal money and give it to the,1564.262,1.669
"states and say, look, we want to give you money for",1565.931,2.135
programs that don&amp;#39;t work -- I can&amp;#39;t defend,1568.066,1.869
that anymore.,1569.935,0.7
We cannot defend that anymore.,1570.635,0.934
We&amp;#39;re $20 trillion in debt.,1571.569,1.635
"We&amp;#39;re going to spend money, we&amp;#39;re going to",1573.204,1.335
"spend a lot of money, but we&amp;#39;re not going to spend",1574.539,1.769
it on programs that cannot show that they actually,1576.308,2.736
deliver the promises that we&amp;#39;ve made to people.,1579.044,1.935
The Press: So you&amp;#39;re talking about programs,1580.979,2.569
that do work or don&amp;#39;t work.,1583.548,1.068
"There&amp;#39;s a program called the SHINE, and it&amp;#39;s in",1584.616,1.335
Pennsylvania -- rural counties of Pennsylvania,1585.951,1.334
that provides after-school educational programs for,1587.285,3.137
"individuals in those areas, which so happens to",1590.422,2.235
be the state that helped propel President Trump,1592.657,2.469
to the White House.,1595.126,0.768
I&amp;#39;m curious to what you say to those Americans in,1595.894,1.735
the community where they tell me today that 800,1597.629,1.968
"individuals will no longer -- children, who need it",1599.597,2.236
"most -- will no longer be provided, in those",1601.833,2.169
"most-needed communities, that educational",1604.002,1.335
care they need.,1605.337,0.667
Director Mulvaney: I&amp;#39;m not familiar -- you all are at,1606.004,1.568
an advantage over me because I&amp;#39;d have to,1607.572,1.368
"memorize all 4,000 line items.",1608.94,1.769
"So let&amp;#39;s talk about after-school programs,",1610.709,1.334
generally.,1612.043,1.168
"They&amp;#39;re supposed to be educational programs, right?",1613.211,1.769
That&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re supposed to do.,1614.98,1.334
They&amp;#39;re supposed to help kids who don&amp;#39;t get fed at,1616.314,1.735
home get fed so they do better in school.,1618.049,1.502
Guess what?,1619.551,0.667
There&amp;#39;s no demonstrable evidence they&amp;#39;re,1620.218,1.335
actually doing that.,1621.553,0.667
There&amp;#39;s no demonstrable evidence of actually,1622.22,1.969
"helping results, helping kids do better in school,",1624.189,2.002
which is what -- when we took your money from you,1626.191,2.135
"to say, look, we&amp;#39;re going to go spend it on an",1628.326,1.335
after-school program.,1629.661,0.667
The way we justified it was these programs are,1630.328,1.335
going to help these kids do better in school and,1631.663,1.368
get better jobs.,1633.031,0.667
And we can&amp;#39;t --,1633.698,0.668
"The Press: To be clear, we&amp;#39;re saying that --",1634.366,1.334
Director Mulvaney: -- prove that that&amp;#39;s happening.,1635.7,1.335
"The Press: To be clear, we&amp;#39;re saying -- the",1637.035,1.335
"administration, with this budget, is saying that no",1638.37,1.334
after-school programs out there are doing their job,1639.704,1.368
in helping educate these children?,1641.072,1.335
"Director Mulvaney: No, but I -- and again, now you&amp;#39;re",1642.407,2.803
"asking me a question I don&amp;#39;t know the answer to,",1645.21,1.334
but I don&amp;#39;t believe we cut all the funding for those,1646.544,3.971
types of things.,1650.515,1.101
"Yes, sir.",1651.616,0.734
"The Press: Just to follow up on that, you were",1652.35,3.504
talking about the steelworker in Ohio and,1655.854,2.435
the coalminer in Pennsylvania and so on.,1658.289,2.837
But those workers may have an elderly mother who,1661.126,2.302
"depends on the Meals on Wheels program, who may",1663.428,3.437
have kids in Head Start.,1666.865,1.968
"And yesterday or the day before, you described this",1668.833,2.102
"as a hard-power budget, but is it also a",1670.935,2.436
hard-hearted measure?,1673.371,0.801
"Director Mulvaney: No, I don&amp;#39;t think so.",1674.172,1.435
"In fact, I think it&amp;#39;s probably one of the most",1675.607,2.269
compassionate things we can do to actually be --,1677.876,2.536
The Press: Cut programs that help the,1680.412,1.334
elderly and kids?,1681.746,0.968
Director Mulvaney: You&amp;#39;re only focusing on half of,1682.714,2.536
"the equation, right?",1685.25,0.667
You&amp;#39;re focusing on recipients of the money.,1685.917,1.335
We&amp;#39;re trying to focus on both the recipients of the,1687.252,1.468
money and the folks who give us the money in,1688.72,1.535
the first place.,1690.255,0.667
And I think it&amp;#39;s fairly compassionate to go to,1690.922,2.236
"them and say, look, we&amp;#39;re not going to ask you for",1693.158,2.335
your hard-earned money anymore.,1695.493,1.535
"A single mom of two in Detroit, okay -- &amp;quot;give us",1697.028,3.67
your money&amp;quot; -- we&amp;#39;re not going to do that anymore,1700.698,2.269
unless we can guarantee --,1702.967,1.068
The Press: And that single,1704.035,1.135
mom has two kids -- what if that single mom has two,1705.17,1.334
kids in Head Start?,1706.504,0.668
Director Mulvaney: Let me finish.,1707.172,1.334
Unless we can guarantee to you that that money is,1708.506,1.335
actually being used in a proper function.,1709.841,2.269
And I think that is about as compassionate,1712.11,1.601
as you can get.,1713.711,0.735
"Yes, ma&amp;#39;am.",1714.446,0.667
The Press: I have a question on the border wall.,1715.113,1.635
Director Mulvaney: Sure.,1716.748,1.268
The Press: Thank you for doing this.,1718.016,2.436
"The budget, as I understand it, asked for",1720.452,2.235
"$4.1 billion, so $1.5 [billion] for this year",1722.687,3.737
and $2.6 [billion] for the following year.,1726.424,2.436
There&amp;#39;s no mention at all of whether or not Mexico,1728.86,3.27
is going to help pay for it or reimburse the U.S.,1732.13,3.57
"for it, as the President pledged.",1735.7,2.035
So where is that money coming from for,1737.735,1.736
the border wall?,1739.471,0.667
Director Mulvaney: A couple of things.,1740.138,1.335
Your number is correct -- it&amp;#39;s $1.5 [billion] for,1741.473,2.335
2017 -- back to your question about 2017 -- and,1743.808,4.138
I think $2.6 [billion] for 2018.,1747.946,2.102
"People have asked me a couple times, does that",1750.048,1.468
build the whole wall.,1751.516,0.767
"No, it doesn&amp;#39;t, but it gets us a start on the",1752.283,2.736
program and you&amp;#39;ll see some of the wall being,1755.019,1.469
"built this year, and then obviously increased",1756.488,2.435
funding in 2018.,1758.923,1.001
But the wall will take longer than two,1759.924,1.969
years to build.,1761.893,1.001
"As to the source of funds, that&amp;#39;s up to the President",1762.894,2.936
and the Treasury and the State Department.,1765.83,1.902
I&amp;#39;m the folks -- we&amp;#39;re the guys at OMB and the gals,1767.732,1.935
at OMB who take the money that we have and allocate,1769.667,1.535
it in a budgetary process.,1771.202,0.668
So it&amp;#39;s up to somebody else to figure out where,1771.87,1.368
the money comes from.,1773.238,0.667
"Yes, sir.",1773.905,0.667
The Press: Yes.,1774.572,0.668
The budget for DOJ zeroes out reimbursements for,1775.24,1.334
state and local jails holding immigrants in the,1776.574,6.106
country illegally.,1782.68,1.402
Some of that money now goes to sanctuary cities.,1784.082,2.335
Is that part of the President&amp;#39;s promise to,1786.417,2.236
withhold funding from sanctuary cities?,1788.653,2.536
And are there other elements of the budget,1791.189,2.035
intended to carry out that punishment that the,1793.224,2.303
President talked about?,1795.527,0.867
"Director Mulvaney: Honestly, I&amp;#39;m not familiar",1796.394,2.202
"with that particular line item, so let me deal with",1798.596,1.535
"the DOJ like this -- and also Homeland, because",1800.131,2.403
there&amp;#39;s many pieces in Homeland that deal with,1802.534,1.901
this sort of topic.,1804.435,0.901
You&amp;#39;re going to see an increase in Homeland for,1805.336,1.902
an increase in detention facilities.,1807.238,1.535
It&amp;#39;s a fairly significant increase in detention,1808.773,2.77
facilities because we have -- the President has said,1811.543,1.935
he wants to stop the catch-and-release program.,1813.478,2.202
"In fact, he signed an executive order",1815.68,2.002
to do just that.,1817.682,0.901
And we fund that; we increase the amount of,1818.583,2.202
money for detention facilities for folks who,1820.785,2.269
come into the country illegally.,1823.054,1.602
I&amp;#39;ll give you a follow-up because I didn&amp;#39;t answer,1824.656,1.334
your first question very well.,1825.99,0.801
The Press: A question about the cuts you&amp;#39;re,1826.791,2.302
making to things like transportation,1829.093,2.069
and housing.,1831.162,1.835
You said those would be paid for later with other,1832.997,2.303
"appropriations, but you said this",1835.3,1.434
would be balanced.,1836.734,1.268
And I know you&amp;#39;ve been a fiscal hawk yourself.,1838.002,1.969
"It sounds like a bit of a shell game, though, where",1839.971,2.97
"you&amp;#39;re saying now this is a balanced budget, but",1842.941,2.402
you&amp;#39;re saying you&amp;#39;re not stopping to pay for other,1845.343,1.935
things because those will be paid for later.,1847.278,1.902
But then where are you going to pay for,1849.18,1.335
those other things?,1850.515,0.667
"Eventually, doesn&amp;#39;t all this stuff have to",1851.182,1.502
get paid for?,1852.684,0.667
"Director Mulvaney: And just to clarify, it&amp;#39;s not",1853.351,1.335
a balanced budget.,1854.686,0.667
There will still be roughly a $488 billion,1855.353,1.969
"deficit, according to the Congressional Budget",1857.322,2.035
"Office, next year.",1859.357,1.001
We simply didn&amp;#39;t add to that in order to spend,1860.358,2.436
more money on the President&amp;#39;s priorities.,1862.794,1.935
"Regarding moving projects out of the, say, the base",1864.729,3.704
budgets for the agencies and into the,1868.433,1.802
"infrastructure, the infrastructure program is",1870.235,1.968
something we&amp;#39;ve just recently started.,1872.203,1.702
It won&amp;#39;t probably come until summer or,1873.905,1.768
maybe even early fall.,1875.673,1.001
"We have to do Obamacare repeal and replace first,",1876.674,3.637
then tax reform second.,1880.311,1.268
"That leaves infrastructure probably third, which may",1881.579,2.102
come after the August recess in Congress.,1883.681,1.835
So you&amp;#39;re making an assumption that I&amp;#39;m not,1885.516,2.937
willing to make.,1888.453,1.134
You&amp;#39;re making an assumption that all that,1889.587,1.335
infrastructure that we provide for later on in,1890.922,1.868
"the year is going to go to the deficit, and I&amp;#39;m not",1892.79,1.836
willing to make that assumption.,1894.626,1.334
"Yes, sir.",1895.96,0.668
The Press: I have two short questions.,1896.628,1.334
"One, the budget blueprint provides robust funding",1897.962,4.204
for embassy security --,1902.166,1.135
"Director Mulvaney: Yes, sir.",1903.301,1.068
The Press: -- citing the Benghazi Accountability,1904.369,1.902
Review Board.,1906.271,0.667
"Does that mean there will be an increase,",1906.938,2.169
considering all the criticism that the,1909.107,1.935
President and Republicans levied against President,1911.042,2.436
Obama for supposedly cutting embassy security?,1913.478,2.636
Director Mulvaney: That&amp;#39;s one of those line items,1916.114,1.801
that we leave up to Secretary Tillerson.,1917.915,2.136
He and I talked about the State Department budget,1920.051,4.671
and how he decides to allocate that.,1924.722,1.602
It may be that there are some embassies that don&amp;#39;t,1926.324,2.369
need a lot more security and some that do.,1928.693,1.602
So we give him the flexibility to do that.,1930.295,2.135
The gentleman in the back had a question.,1932.43,1.768
The Press: Many countries around the world didn&amp;#39;t,1934.198,3.838
take seriously President Trump that he would cut,1938.036,2.902
"the foreign aid, because most of the",1940.938,2.536
countries getting U.S.,1943.474,1.101
aid were not with the U.S.,1944.575,2.169
"supporting terrorism against the U.S., and also",1946.744,2.536
they were not working with the U.S.,1949.28,2.536
So how does President Trump feel now,1951.816,2.503
about those countries?,1954.319,0.967
Will they continue the aid?,1955.286,1.668
Because U.S.,1956.954,1.202
taxpayers will be asking that we don&amp;#39;t have to,1958.156,3.003
spend on those countries who are against the U.S.,1961.159,2.469
"Director Mulvaney: Again, I come back to what the",1963.628,2.135
"President said on the campaign, which is that",1965.763,1.769
he&amp;#39;s going to spend less money overseas.,1967.532,1.902
"To your question, though -- because this came up",1969.434,2.068
the other day -- which is the hard power,1971.502,1.836
versus soft power.,1973.338,2.669
There is a very deliberate attempt here to send a,1976.007,2.402
"message to our allies and our friends, such as",1978.409,2.236
"India, and our adversaries with other countries,",1980.645,2.502
"shall we say, which is that this is hard-power",1983.147,2.102
"budget, that this administration tends to",1985.249,1.535
change course from a soft-power budget to a,1986.784,2.57
"hard-power budget, and that&amp;#39;s a message that our",1989.354,1.935
adversaries and our allies alike should take.,1991.289,2.669
"I&amp;#39;ll take one more, because I&amp;#39;m sort",1993.958,1.335
of running down.,1995.293,0.667
"Yes, ma&amp;#39;am.",1995.96,0.667
The Press: Can you explain a little bit more about,1996.627,3.37
what message the President is trying to send by,1999.997,3.504
eliminating a lot of funding for science and,2003.501,3.136
"climate change research, as you mentioned earlier?",2006.637,2.703
And just a follow-up later when you get a chance.,2009.34,3.904
Director Mulvaney: Sure.,2013.244,1.168
A couple different messages.,2014.412,1.568
When we talked about science and climate,2015.98,2.736
"change, let&amp;#39;s deal with them separately.",2018.716,2.603
"On science, we&amp;#39;re going to function -- we&amp;#39;re going to",2021.319,2.102
focus on the core function.,2023.421,1.435
"There&amp;#39;s reductions, for example, I think, in the",2024.856,2.769
NIH -- the National Institutes of Health. Why?,2027.625,2.736
"Because we think there&amp;#39;s been mission creep, we",2030.361,2.736
think they do things that are outside,2033.097,2.403
their core functions.,2035.5,1.034
We think there&amp;#39;s tremendous,2036.534,1.368
opportunity for savings.,2037.902,1.034
"We recommend, for example, that a couple of",2038.936,2.736
facilities be combined; there would be cost,2041.672,1.969
savings from that.,2043.641,1.135
"Again, this comes back to the President&amp;#39;s business",2044.776,2.869
"person view of government, which is if you took over",2047.645,2.77
"this as a CEO, and you&amp;#39;d look at this on a",2050.415,2.168
"spreadsheet and go, why do we have all of these",2052.583,1.669
facilities -- why do we have seven when we can do,2054.252,1.968
"the same job with three, won&amp;#39;t that save money?",2056.22,1.735
"And the answer is, yes.",2057.955,1.368
So part of your answer is focusing on efficiencies,2059.323,3.07
and focusing on doing what we do better.,2062.393,2.202
"Regarding the question as to climate change, I think",2064.595,2.736
the President was fairly straightforward -- we&amp;#39;re,2067.331,1.502
not spending money on that anymore; we consider that,2068.833,2.135
to be a waste of your money to go out and do that.,2070.968,2.269
So that is a specific tie to his campaign.,2073.237,2.136
The Press: A follow-up --,2075.373,1.334
"Director Mulvaney: Yes, I&amp;#39;m sorry,",2076.707,1.335
you had a follow-up.,2078.042,0.667
The Press: Just really quick on Meals on Wheels.,2078.709,1.802
You mentioned that it&amp;#39;s one of those programs,2080.511,1.902
that&amp;#39;s determined had not been doing its,2082.413,2.403
job effectively.,2084.816,0.734
What evidence are you using to make,2085.55,2.569
that statement?,2088.119,0.701
And is not feeding seniors in and of itself the,2088.82,3.67
fulfillment of the --,2092.49,1.435
Director Mulvaney: And my understanding from,2093.925,2.335
having been in the state,2096.26,0.768
government -- and I may have this wrong; I&amp;#39;ve been,2097.028,1.768
wrong several times today -- this may not,2098.796,1.335
be the first time.,2100.131,0.667
But my understanding of Meals on Wheels is that,2100.798,1.535
that is a state determination.,2102.333,1.735
The federal government doesn&amp;#39;t directly fund,2104.068,2.436
that; it funds the central Community Development,2106.504,3.737
"Block Grants, the CDBGs.",2110.241,1.735
And some states choose to take the money and do,2111.976,2.569
Meals and Wheels.,2114.545,0.901
Other states and localities might choose to,2115.446,2.102
do something else with them.,2117.548,1.535
We look at the CDBGs.,2119.083,1.535
"And when we do that, we look at this as $150",2120.618,2.469
"billion spent over 40 years, without the",2123.087,3.27
appreciable benefits to show for that type of,2126.357,2.636
taxpayer expenditure.,2128.993,0.934
And that&amp;#39;s why we have the reduction.,2129.927,1.335
The Press: May I follow up on that?,2131.262,1.468
"Director Mulvaney: No, because I&amp;#39;m going to --",2132.73,1.769
how Sean does this every day for an hour and a,2134.499,2.402
"half, I have no idea.",2136.901,1.068
(Laughter.),2137.969,0.667
But I&amp;#39;m going to --,2138.636,0.934
"Mr. Spicer: No, keep going.",2139.57,0.801
(Laughter.),2140.371,0.667
"Director Mulvaney: Yeah, exactly.",2141.038,1.335
(Laughter.),2142.373,0.667
I&amp;#39;ve been up since 4:00 a.m.,2143.04,0.668
"this morning, so I&amp;#39;m going to turn it back",2143.708,1.368
over to Sean.,2145.076,0.667
Thank you very much.,2145.743,0.667
And we&amp;#39;ll talk to you all soon.,2146.41,2.636
"Mr. Spicer: Thanks, guys.",2149.046,2.236
"Anyway, so to kick it off, Jonathan Karl.",2151.282,4.404
"The Press: So, Sean, the day before yesterday you",2155.686,4.305
said you were extremely confident that the House,2159.991,3.57
and Senate Intelligence Committees would,2163.561,2.602
ultimately vindicate the President&amp;#39;s allegation,2166.163,2.203
that Trump Tower was wiretapped.,2168.366,2.102
"As I&amp;#39;m sure you have now seen, the Senate",2170.468,2.602
Intelligence Committee has said they see no,2173.07,2.47
indications Trump Tower was the subject,2175.54,2.035
of surveillance.,2177.575,1.435
That seems to be a pretty blanket statement.,2179.01,2.869
What&amp;#39;s your reaction?,2181.879,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think there&amp;#39;s several things.",2182.547,1.701
"It&amp;#39;s interesting to me that, just as a point of",2184.248,4.204
"interest, that when one entity says one thing that",2188.452,4.338
"proves -- that claims one things, you guys",2192.79,1.735
cover it ad nauseam.,2194.525,1.769
"When Devin Nunes came out and said, I think it&amp;#39;s",2196.294,1.635
very possible -- yesterday -- it was,2197.929,2.102
crickets from you guys.,2200.031,1.334
When Devin Nunes came out and said there was no,2201.365,1.902
connection that he saw to Russia -- crickets.,2203.267,3.003
When Tom Cotton said the same.,2206.27,1.568
You don&amp;#39;t want to cover the stuff -- The Press:,2207.838,1.736
Devin Nunes said he saw no evidence of wiretapping,2209.574,2.502
at Trump Tower.,2212.076,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, hold on -- actually --",2212.743,1.335
The Press: Now you&amp;#39;ve had the House Intelligence,2214.078,1.368
Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee --,2215.446,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, actually here&amp;#39;s his quote,",2216.781,1.334
Jonathan.,2218.115,0.668
"No, here&amp;#39;s the direct quote: &amp;quot;I think",2218.783,1.334
it&amp;#39;s very possible.&amp;quot;,2220.117,0.668
That&amp;#39;s what he said when he said the President&amp;#39;s,2220.785,1.334
communications could have been swept,2222.119,1.368
up in collection. So again --,2223.487,0.835
The Press: He said there was no -- &amp;quot;I,2224.322,1.334
saw no indication of wiretapping&amp;quot; --,2225.656,1.368
no evidence of wiretapping.,2227.024,1.001
Mr. Spicer: I understand that.,2228.025,1.635
And I think the President has been very clear when,2229.66,1.335
he talked about this -- and he talked about it,2230.995,1.335
last night -- when he talked about wiretapping,2232.33,1.334
"he meant surveillance, and that there have been",2233.664,2.269
incidents that have occurred.,2235.933,1.301
Devin Nunes couldn&amp;#39;t have stated it more beautifully.,2237.234,2.069
But you choose not to cover that part.,2239.303,2.002
"You chose not to cover when Tom Cotton went out,",2241.305,2.336
"when Richard Burr went out, when others --",2243.641,1.969
Chairmen Nunes and others -- and said that there,2245.61,1.501
was no -- hold on --,2247.111,0.734
"The Press: Well, the Senate",2247.845,0.667
Intelligence Committee is saying point blank -- they,2248.512,1.368
say no evidence of surveillance.,2249.88,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: I understand that, Jonathan.",2251.215,1.335
"And where was your passion, and where was",2252.55,1.334
your concern when they all said that there was no,2253.884,1.335
connection to Russia?,2255.219,0.834
Where was it then?,2256.053,1.969
Crickets from you guys.,2258.022,1.068
Because at the end of the day when -- The Press: So,2259.09,1.968
you&amp;#39;re saying the President stands by his,2261.058,2.336
allegation that President Obama wiretapped,2263.394,2.035
the Trump Tower?,2265.429,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, no, hold on.",2266.097,1.368
Hold on.,2267.465,0.667
I&amp;#39;m making a point.,2268.132,0.667
"The point is this: Number one, that it&amp;#39;s interesting",2268.799,1.335
how when evidence comes out and people who have,2270.134,1.335
been briefed on the Russia connection come out and,2271.469,1.334
say that there was nothing that they have seen that,2272.803,1.335
"proves a connection, you choose not to cover that,",2274.138,1.368
"you don&amp;#39;t stop the narrative, you continue to",2275.506,1.969
perpetuate a false narrative.,2277.475,1.301
"When he came out yesterday and said, &amp;quot;I see no",2278.776,2.135
"evidence that this happened&amp;quot;; when he said,",2280.911,1.969
"&amp;quot;I think it&amp;#39;s very possible, but like I said,",2282.88,1.902
"we should know later,&amp;quot; you don&amp;#39;t cover that part.",2284.782,2.069
You only cover the parts that -- but let&amp;#39;s go,2286.851,2.135
through what we do know. Okay?,2288.986,1.502
The Press: I want you to respond to the Senate,2290.488,1.801
Intelligence Committee.,2292.289,0.968
"Mr. Spicer: Hold on, hold on, let me -- and I am",2293.257,2.269
"trying to answer your question, Jonathan, if",2295.526,1.335
you can calm down.,2296.861,0.667
If you look at what The New York Times reported on,2297.528,1.335
"January 12th, 2017, they said, &amp;quot;In its final days,",2298.863,3.637
the Obama administration has expanded the power of,2302.5,2.002
the National Security Agency to share globally,2304.502,2.502
intercepted personal communications with the,2307.004,2.069
government&amp;#39;s 16 other intelligence agencies,2309.073,2.736
before applying privacy protections.,2311.809,2.035
The new rules significantly relax,2313.844,1.669
longstanding limits on what the NSA may do with,2315.513,2.335
the information gathered by its most powerful,2317.848,2.336
"surveillance operation, which are largely",2320.184,1.735
unregulated by wiretapping laws.&amp;quot;,2321.919,1.702
When Sara Carter reported that &amp;quot;by the start of the,2323.621,3.303
"new year, it brought with it unexpected politicizing",2326.924,2.536
of the intelligence gathered in secret.,2329.46,2.336
"Separately, the Obama administration amended a",2331.796,2.035
"longstanding executive order, allowing",2333.831,2.169
information intercepted through FISA warrants or,2336,2.536
by the National Security Agency to be shared by a,2338.536,2.302
wider audience and 16 government agencies as,2340.838,2.536
"Obama was leave office, intelligence normally",2343.374,2.536
reserved for just a handful of intelligence,2345.91,1.802
leaders was spread throughout briefings to,2347.712,2.569
"scores of workers, and soon leaks began appearing",2350.281,3.003
"in news media office organizations, often in",2353.284,2.702
stories lacking context of how national security,2355.986,2.67
investigations are actually concluded.&amp;quot; On,2358.656,2.135
"March 3rd, Fox News chief anchor Bret Baier said",2360.791,3.37
that the following: &amp;quot;There was a report in June 2016,2364.161,3.571
-- a FISA request by the Obama administration --,2367.732,2.302
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court -- to,2370.034,2.135
monitor communications involving Donald Trump and,2372.169,3.237
several other campaign officials.,2375.406,2.035
Then they got turned down.,2377.441,1.068
"Then in October, then they renewed it and did a",2378.509,2.302
startup wiretap at Trump Tower with some computer,2380.811,2.202
"and Russian banks.&amp;quot; Baier continues, &amp;quot;A June FISA",2383.013,3.07
request that foreign intelligence surveillance,2386.083,2.036
courts gets shot down.,2388.119,1.334
"A judge says&amp;quot; -- hold -- Jonathan, I&amp;#39;m going to --",2389.453,2.936
you can ask -- you can follow up -- &amp;quot;A judge says,2392.389,2.837
no-go to monitoring Trump Tower.,2395.226,1.368
They go back in October.,2396.594,1.501
They do get a FISA granted.,2398.095,1.602
This is wiretap going on and a monitoring of,2399.697,1.935
"computers that have some ties, they believe, to",2401.632,2.136
Russian accounts.,2403.768,0.667
"By all accounts, they don&amp;#39;t come up with",2404.435,2.069
"anything in the investigation, but the",2406.504,1.568
investigation continues and we don&amp;#39;t know it.,2408.072,2.436
"On November 11th, 2016, days after the election,",2410.508,3.036
"Heat Street reported, &amp;quot;Two separate sources with",2413.544,2.569
links to the counter-intelligence,2416.113,1.335
community had confirmed to Heat Street that the FBI,2417.448,2.202
"sought and was granted a FISA warrant in October,",2419.65,2.603
giving counter-surveillance,2422.253,1.201
intelligence permission to,2423.454,1.401
examine the activities of U.S.,2424.855,1.402
persons in Donald Trump&amp;#39;s campaign with ties to Russia.,2426.257,3.036
"The first request, which sources say named Trump,",2429.293,2.536
was denied back in June.,2431.829,1.601
But the second was drawn more narrowly and granted,2433.43,1.936
"in October after evidence was presented of a server,",2435.366,2.669
possibly related to the Trump campaign and its,2438.035,2.236
alleged links to two banks,2440.271,1.768
-- SVB bank and Russia&amp;#39;s Alfa-Bank.,2442.039,1.735
Sources suggest that a FISA warrant was granted,2443.774,2.436
to look at the full context of related,2446.21,2.035
documents that concern U.S. persons.,2448.245,2.236
Two separate sources with links to the,2450.481,1.635
counter-intelligence community have confirmed,2452.116,2.102
that the FBI sought and was granted a FISA warrant,2454.218,2.235
in October giving counter-intelligence,2456.453,1.402
permission to examine the activity of U.S.,2457.855,2.169
persons in Donald Trump&amp;#39;s campaign with ties to Russia.&amp;quot;,2460.024,2.903
They go on: &amp;quot;The FISA warrant was granted in,2462.927,2.602
connection with investigation of suspected,2465.529,1.902
activities between the server and two banks.,2467.431,2.436
"However, it is thought that the intelligence",2469.867,1.635
community that the warrant covers any U.S.,2471.502,2.002
person connected to this U.N.,2473.504,1.568
"investigation, and thus covers Donald Trump and at",2475.072,2.503
least three further men who have either formed,2477.575,2.569
part of his campaign or acted as media surrogates.&amp;quot;,2480.144,2.903
"On January 19th, the New York Times reported the",2483.047,2.836
following: &amp;quot;American law enforcement and,2485.883,2.769
intelligence agencies are examining intercepted,2488.652,2.77
communication and financial transactions as,2491.422,2.369
part of a broad investigation of possible,2493.791,2.035
links between Russian officials and associates,2495.826,2.603
of President-elect Donald J. Trump.,2498.429,1.902
One official said intelligence reports based,2500.331,2.102
on some of the wiretapped communications have been,2502.433,2.235
provided to the White House.,2504.668,1.402
It is unclear which Russian officials under,2506.07,2.202
investigation or what particular conversations,2508.272,2.369
caught the attention of American eavesdroppers.,2510.641,2.669
The legal standard for opening these,2513.31,1.402
investigations is low.,2514.712,1.268
"Andy McCarthy, writing in National Review,",2515.98,3.503
"suggested: &amp;quot;From three reports, from the",2519.483,1.702
"Guardian, Heat Street and the New York Times, it",2521.185,2.736
appears the FBI has concerns about a private,2523.921,1.401
server in Trump Tower that was connected to one or,2525.322,1.869
two Russian banks.,2527.191,1.201
Heat Street describes these concerns as,2528.392,1.768
centering on &amp;quot;possible financial and,2530.16,3.471
banking offenses.&amp;quot;,2533.631,1.301
This is his quote -- &amp;quot;I italicized the word,2534.932,2.302
&amp;quot;offenses&amp;quot; because it denotes crimes.,2537.234,2.169
"Ordinarily, when crimes are suspected, there is a",2539.403,2.002
"criminal investigation, not a national",2541.405,1.802
security investigation.&amp;quot;,2543.207,1.501
We go on.,2544.708,0.668
"Sara Carter from Circa, reporting, &amp;quot;Intelligence",2545.376,2.168
professionals tell Circa News they were concerned,2547.544,2.203
that some of the Russian intelligence was spread,2549.747,2.135
through group briefings to a much-larger-than-usual,2551.882,2.302
audience back in January.,2554.184,1.936
This would have happened during the final days of,2556.12,1.902
the Obama administration when it expanded executive,2558.022,2.903
"order 12333, which allows employees with a &amp;quot;need to",2560.925,4.371
know&amp;quot; have further unfettered access to raw,2565.296,2.369
data stowed by the NSA.,2567.665,1.334
The new rules allowed the NSA to share &amp;quot;raw signals,2568.999,3.537
"intelligence information, including the names of",2572.536,2.369
those involved in phone conversations and emails.,2574.905,2.636
The expansion of the order makes it difficult to,2577.541,1.969
"narrow in on the leaks and, frankly, it allows",2579.51,2.135
"too many people access to the raw data, which only",2581.645,2.736
"used to be available to a select few, said a U.S.",2584.381,1.969
official who spoke on the condition of anonymity and,2586.35,2.869
was not granted to speak on the authority.,2589.219,2.036
"Numerous outlets, including the New York",2591.255,1.635
"Times, have reported on the FBI investigation into",2592.89,3.103
"Mr. Trump&amp;#39;s advisors; BBC, and then McClatchy",2595.993,2.636
revealed the existence of a multi-agency working,2598.629,3.203
group to coordinate investigations,2601.832,2.035
across the thing.,2603.867,1.202
"On February 14th, the New York Times again refers to",2605.069,2.802
phone record and intercepted calls -- let,2607.871,2.503
me quote them -- &amp;quot;American law enforcement,2610.374,1.902
intelligence agency intercepted the,2612.276,1.935
communications around the same times they were,2614.211,1.935
discovering the evidence that Russia was trying to,2616.146,2.203
disrupt the presidential election by hacking into,2618.349,2.102
"the Democratic National Committee,",2620.451,1.701
three officials said.,2622.152,1.468
The intelligence agencies then thought to learn,2623.62,3.237
whether the Trump campaign was colluding with the,2626.857,1.735
Russians on hacking or other efforts to,2628.592,2.002
influence the election.,2630.594,1.268
The officials interviewed in recent weeks said that,2631.862,2.336
so far they have seen no evidence of,2634.198,2.068
such cooperation.,2636.266,1.368
The official said that the intercepted communications,2637.634,2.103
are not limited to Trump campaign officials and,2639.737,2.202
other associates of Mr. Trump.,2641.939,1.701
The call logs and intercepted communications,2643.64,2.103
are part of a larger trove of information that the,2645.743,3.77
FBI is sifting through.,2649.513,1.335
"Days later, the New York Times then reports, &amp;quot;In",2650.848,2.936
"the Obama administration&amp;#39;s last days, some White",2653.784,3.003
House officials scrambled to spread information,2656.787,1.902
about Russian efforts to undermine the presidential,2658.689,2.269
"election of Donald Trump, connections between the",2660.958,2.469
President-elect and,2663.427,1.268
Russians across the government.,2664.695,1.902
But the increasingly hard-to-escape conclusion,2666.597,2.302
that in our government -- that individuals in our,2668.899,1.335
government were instead trying to undermine the,2670.234,1.768
"new President by saying, quote -- this is the New",2672.002,3.637
"York Times again -- &amp;quot;At intelligence agencies,",2675.639,2.136
there was a push to process as much raw,2677.775,2.502
intelligence in a possible analysis to keep the,2680.277,2.536
report at relatively low classification levels to,2682.813,3.704
ensure a widespread readership across,2686.517,2.168
the government.,2688.685,0.935
"And in some cases, &amp;quot;among them, European allies.&amp;quot;",2689.62,3.136
This allowed the upload of as much information --,2692.756,2.369
"intelligence as possible to Intellipedia, a secret",2695.125,3.07
Wiki used by American analysts to,2698.195,4.638
share information.,2702.833,1.802
"Sean Hannity went on Fox to say, &amp;quot;But protections",2704.635,2.636
which are known as minimization procedures,2707.271,1.935
have been put in place to protect Americans that are,2709.206,2.436
"not under warrant, American citizens that are",2711.642,2.068

"a felony, to the press that printed it.&amp;quot;",2729.793,2.236
"Last, on Fox News on March 14th, Judge Andrew",2732.029,3.804
Napolitano made the following statement.,2735.833,1.735

chain of command.,2741.605,0.968
"He didn&amp;#39;t use the NSA, he didn&amp;#39;t use the CIA, he",2742.573,2.569
"didn&amp;#39;t use the FBI, and he didn&amp;#39;t use the",2745.142,1.735

"So simply, by having two people saying to them,",2752.85,2.802

conversations involved in candidate Trump&amp;#39;s,2757.087,1.769
"conversations involving President-elect Trump,&amp;#39; he",2758.856,2.202

Putting the published accounts and common sense,2764.795,1.635
"together, this leads to a lot.",2766.43,1.968

"Mr. Spicer: No, they&amp;#39;re not findings.",2775.739,1.435
There&amp;#39;s a statement out today.,2777.174,2.602
"They have not begun this -- as you know, yesterday,",2779.776,2.47
"or two days ago, the Department of Justice",2782.246,1.534
asked for an additional week.,2783.78,1.569
"So the statement clearly says that at this time,",2785.349,3.97
that they don&amp;#39;t believe that.,2789.319,1.402
They have yet to go through the information.,2790.721,1.735
"The Department of Justice, as you know, has",2792.456,2.369
not supplied this.,2794.825,0.801
"But I&amp;#39;ve just read off to you -- it&amp;#39;s interesting,",2795.626,1.968
when the New York Times reports --,2797.594,1.368
The Press: I let you do that whole long answer.,2798.962,2.002
Can I just ask my question?,2800.964,1.202
Mr. Spicer: Thank you.,2802.166,1.001
Appreciate it.,2803.167,0.667
The Press: Okay.,2803.834,0.667
So are you saying that the President still stands by,2804.501,2.703
his allegation that President Obama ordered,2807.204,3.236
wiretapping or surveillance of Trump,2810.44,2.436
"Tower, despite the fact that the Senate",2812.876,2.436
Intelligence Committee says they see no,2815.312,1.768
indication that it happened?,2817.08,1.602
Does the President still stand by the allegation?,2818.682,1.869
"Mr. Spicer: No, but -- first of all, he stands by",2820.551,1.935
"it, but again, you&amp;#39;re mischaracterizing what",2822.486,1.368
happened today.,2823.854,0.667
"The Press: No, the Senate has no indication.",2824.521,1.335
I&amp;#39;m reading exactly from their statement.,2825.856,1.335
Mr. Spicer: I understand that.,2827.191,0.7
"And at the same time, they acknowledge that they have",2827.891,2.536
not been in contact with the Department of Justice.,2830.427,2.369
"Again, I&amp;#39;d go back to what I said at the beginning.",2832.796,2.169
It&amp;#39;s interesting --,2834.965,0.667
The Press: They&amp;#39;ve been briefed by the FBI Director.,2835.632,1.669
They&amp;#39;ve been --,2837.301,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Hold on. It&amp;#39;s interesting how at the same,2837.968,1.802
"time, where were you coming to the defense",2839.77,1.802
of that same intelligence,2841.572,0.967
committee and those members when they said,2842.539,1.502
there was no connection to Russia?,2844.041,1.535
You didn&amp;#39;t seem to report it then.,2845.576,1.334
There was no --,2846.91,0.668
The Press: Because --,2847.578,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, no, so you want -- hold on, you want",2848.245,1.501
to comment and you want to perpetuate a,2849.746,1.502
false narrative.,2851.248,0.767
"The Press: Actually, I did report that Clapper said that.",2852.015,2.236
I actually did.,2854.251,0.901
Mr. Spicer: But when those individuals have gone out,2855.152,1.468
"time and time again, when Chairman Nunes has said,",2856.62,1.635
"number one, that there was no information that he&amp;#39;s",2858.255,1.902
"aware of that that existed, that got",2860.157,1.835
zero reporting.,2861.992,1.068
"Number two, when he went out yesterday and said, &amp;quot;I",2863.06,2.002
"think it&amp;#39;s very possible,&amp;quot; you don&amp;#39;t include that in",2865.062,2.169
the question mark.,2867.231,0.9
"The bottom line is, is that the President said",2868.131,1.802
last night that he will be -- that there will be,2869.933,2.136
additional information coming forward.,2872.069,1.935
There&amp;#39;s a ton of media reports out there that,2874.004,2.002
indicate that something was going on during the,2876.006,1.735
26 [2016] election.,2877.741,1.235
"And I think it&amp;#39;s interesting, where was the",2878.976,1.468
question of the New York Times or these other,2880.444,1.902
outlets when that was going on?,2882.346,1.601
Where was the question --,2883.947,0.834
The Press: So he&amp;#39;ll be vindicated.,2884.781,1.335
You think he&amp;#39;s going to be vindicated.,2886.116,1.335
Mr. Spicer: I believe he will. Jim.,2887.451,1.334
"The Press: Yeah, you were just quoting",2888.785,1.335
Sean Hannity there.,2890.12,0.868
The House and Senate intelligence committees,2890.988,1.501
are quoting the FBI Director.,2892.489,1.168
You&amp;#39;re citing Sean Hannity and Andrew Napolitano.,2893.657,1.602
Mr. Spicer: I also quoted -- I get you&amp;#39;re going to,2895.259,2.502
"cherry-pick -- no, no, okay, you also tend to",2897.761,2.069
overlook all of the other sources that -- because I,2899.83,2.302
know you want to cherry-pick it.,2902.132,1.502
"But at the -- no, no, but you do.",2903.634,1.801
But where was your concern about the,2905.435,1.535
New York Times reporting?,2906.97,0.801
You didn&amp;#39;t seem to have a concern with that.,2907.771,1.435
The Press: We have done plenty of reporting on,2909.206,2.269
"all of this, Sean.",2911.475,0.867
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, but you want to cherry-pick",2912.342,2.603
one piece of commentary --,2914.945,0.867
The Press: These connections,2915.812,0.668
between the aides of the President --,2916.48,1.334
associates of the President to the Russians,2917.814,1.335
has all been looked at and it&amp;#39;s --,2919.149,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: No, wait, how do you know all this?",2920.484,1.601
How do you seem to be such an expert on this?,2922.085,1.835
"The Press: I&amp;#39;m saying that this has been looked at, Sean.",2923.92,2.57
We&amp;#39;ve all looked at it.,2926.49,1.768
Mr. Spicer: How do you know it&amp;#39;s been looked at?,2928.258,1.335
The Press: There have been --,2929.593,0.701
"Mr. Spicer: Hold on,",2930.294,0.667
"hold on, where is -- I&amp;#39;m sorry, I&amp;#39;m afraid to",2930.961,1.335
understand -- can you tell me how you know that all,2932.296,2.035
of this has &amp;quot;been looked at&amp;quot;?,2934.331,1.601
The Press: You&amp;#39;re asking me whether or not it&amp;#39;s,2935.932,2.67
been looked at?,2938.602,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: You made a statement, you said, &amp;quot;All",2939.269,1.335
of this has been looked at.&amp;quot;,2940.604,0.701
"The Press: Our outlet, other outlets have reported --",2941.305,2.802
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, so -- okay,",2944.107,1.402
so when your outlet says it&amp;#39;s all been looked at --,2945.509,1.334
The Press: -- on contacts between associates and,2946.843,1.335
aides of the President and the Russians during,2948.178,1.335
the 2016 campaign.,2949.513,0.667
It sounds like during the context of that,2950.18,1.335
investigation there might have been some,2951.515,1.368
intercepted communications.,2952.883,0.767
The House Intelligence Committee Chairman did,2953.65,2.236
"mention that, and we have reported that, others have",2955.886,2.202
reported that on our air and in,2958.088,2.736
various publications.,2960.824,1.201
"But, Sean, what you are refusing to answer -- the",2962.025,2.97
question that you&amp;#39;re refusing to answer is,2964.995,1.435
whether or not the President still,2966.43,1.368
believes what he believes --,2967.798,1.568
"Mr. Spicer: No, I&amp;#39;m not -- I just said to Jonathan.",2969.366,2.402
I didn&amp;#39;t refuse --,2971.768,0.801
The Press: But you have a,2972.569,1.201
"Senate and House Intelligence Committee,",2973.77,1.335
both leaders from both parties on both of those,2975.105,1.768
panels saying that they don&amp;#39;t see any evidence,2976.873,2.236
of any wiretapping.,2979.109,1.368
So how can the President go on and continue to,2980.477,2.536
say these things?,2983.013,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Because that&amp;#39;s not -- because you&amp;#39;re,2983.68,1.802
mischaracterizing what Chairman Nunes said.,2985.482,1.335
"He said, &amp;quot;I think it&amp;#39;s possible&amp;quot; -- he&amp;#39;s",2986.817,1.334
following up on this.,2988.151,0.834
So to suggest that is actually -- and you&amp;#39;re,2988.985,2.67
stating unequivocally that you somehow -- The Press:,2991.655,1.668
"He said, if you take the President literally -- he",2993.323,1.335
"said, if you take the President literally,",2994.658,1.334
he is wrong.,2995.992,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: Right, and I think that we&amp;#39;ve",2996.66,1.334
already cleared that up.,2997.994,0.668
And he said exactly that.,2998.662,0.667
But the President has already said clearly when,2999.329,1.368
he referred to wiretapping he was referring,3000.697,1.335
to surveillance.,3002.032,0.667
"The Press: Right, but it sounds like, Sean, that",3002.699,1.702
"you and the President are saying now, well, we don&amp;#39;t",3004.401,2.169
mean wiretapping anymore because that&amp;#39;s not true,3006.57,2.068
"anymore, so now we&amp;#39;re going to expand that to",3008.638,1.902
other forms of surveillance.,3010.54,0.868
What&amp;#39;s it going to be next?,3011.408,1.268
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, Jim, I think that&amp;#39;s cute, but at",3012.676,2.335
the end of the day -- we&amp;#39;ve talked about this,3015.011,2.203
for three or four days.,3017.214,0.7
The President had &amp;quot;wiretapping&amp;quot; in quotes;,3017.914,3.437
he was referring to broad surveillance.,3021.351,1.902
And now you&amp;#39;re basically going back.,3023.253,1.335
We talked about this several days ago.,3024.588,1.802
"The bottom line is, is that the investigation by",3026.39,2.302
the House and the Senate has not been provided,3028.692,1.902
all of the information.,3030.594,1.301
And when it does --,3031.895,0.934
The Press: It sounds like your,3032.829,1.335
"information is news reports, not evidence, not",3034.164,1.335
conversations with the FBI Director.,3035.499,1.334
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, what -- I think the President",3036.833,1.335
addressed that last night.,3038.168,0.667
He said there&amp;#39;s more to come.,3038.835,0.701
These are merely pointing out that I think there is,3039.536,1.869
widespread reporting that throughout the 2016,3041.405,3.47
election there was surveillance that was done,3044.875,1.801
on a variety of people that came up.,3046.676,2.169
The Press: There was an investigation going on,3048.845,2.77
into whether there were contacts between the,3051.615,1.935
President&amp;#39;s campaign and the Russians.,3053.55,2.903
"Of course, they&amp;#39;re going to be looking at",3056.453,1.335
these various things.,3057.788,0.667
"I mean, isn&amp;#39;t that right?",3058.455,0.701
Mr. Spicer: I get it.,3059.156,0.667
Somehow you seem to believe that you have all,3059.823,1.335
"of this information, you&amp;#39;ve been read in on all",3061.158,1.334
"of these things, which I find very interesting.",3062.492,1.335
The Press: I haven&amp;#39;t been read in by the FBI,3063.827,1.335
"Director, but the House and Senate Intelligence",3065.162,2.636
Committees have been.,3067.798,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Well, no, you&amp;#39;re coming to some",3068.465,1.335
serious conclusions for a guy that has,3069.8,1.334
zero intelligence --,3071.134,0.701
(laughter),3071.835,0.667
"-- The Press: Give me some credit, Sean.",3072.502,1.335
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;ll give you some -- The Press: A,3073.837,1.335
little intelligence maybe.,3075.172,0.667
"But no, what I&amp;#39;m saying is that --",3075.839,1.335
Mr. Spicer: Clearance.,3077.174,0.667
I wasn&amp;#39;t done. Clearance.,3077.841,0.901
Maybe both.,3078.742,0.667
"The Press: Well, come on, now.",3079.409,1.435
Those two panels have spoken with the FBI,3080.844,1.969
Director and have been told there&amp;#39;s no,3082.813,1.635
evidence of this.,3084.448,0.667
So why not just -- why can&amp;#39;t we just end this,3085.115,1.368
farce and just have the President say,3086.483,1.335
he was wrong?,3087.818,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Okay, I think this question has been",3088.485,1.335
"asked and answered, Jim.",3089.82,0.667
It&amp;#39;s interesting how you jump to all of these,3090.487,1.668
conclusions about what they have and what they,3092.155,1.335
"don&amp;#39;t have, and you seem to know all the answers.",3093.49,2.402
"But at the end of the day, there was clearly a ton of",3095.892,1.902
"reporting -- The Press: So a week from now, we&amp;#39;re",3097.794,2.136
"going to be wrong, you&amp;#39;re going to be right?",3099.93,1.935
"Mr. Spicer: Hold on, Jim.",3101.865,0.834
Let me answer -- I think that there has been a vast,3102.699,2.035
"amount of reporting, which I just detailed, about",3104.734,1.502
activity that was going on in the 2016 election.,3106.236,2.903
There&amp;#39;s no question that there was surveillance,3109.139,1.635
techniques used throughout this I think by a variety,3110.774,2.736
of outlets that have reported this,3113.51,1.935
activity concluded.,3115.445,1.368
And I think when you actually ask those two,3116.813,2.102
people whether or not -- and as Chairman Nunes said,3118.915,2.536
"yesterday, when you take it literally and --",3121.451,1.668
"wiretapping, the President has already been very",3123.119,1.902
clear that he didn&amp;#39;t mean specifically wiretapping.,3125.021,2.269
He had it in quotes.,3127.29,1.202
So I think to fall back on that is a false premise.,3128.492,3.103
That&amp;#39;s not what he said.,3131.595,2.102
He was very clear about that when he talked,3133.697,1.668
about it yesterday. Major.,3135.365,1.435
"The Press: So just to be clear, you&amp;#39;re good and the",3136.8,3.136
President is good with stories that have,3139.936,1.769
anonymous sources in them.,3141.705,0.967
"Mr. Spicer: No, it&amp;#39;s interesting -- I think",3142.672,2.369
"when it comes to the Russia story, and the",3145.041,1.902
on-the-record sources who have been briefed by the,3146.943,2.036
FBI continue to conclude that there&amp;#39;s nothing,3148.979,2.335
"there, you guys continue to fall back on these",3151.314,2.369
anonymous sources and perpetuate a,3153.683,1.535
false narrative.,3155.218,1.168
And yet when it comes to us talking about all these,3156.386,2.035
"reports in there, you then criticize the",3158.421,1.702
anonymous sources.,3160.123,0.801
The Press: I&amp;#39;m just asking.,3160.924,1.468
"Mr. Spicer: No, it&amp;#39;s just interesting that sort of",3162.392,1.668
the double standard that exists when it comes to us,3164.06,1.602
citing stories when it comes -- and then how you,3165.662,2.97
intend to use them.,3168.632,0.734
The Press: So let me ask you what the President,3169.366,1.368
said last night.,3170.734,0.7
He was asked by Tucker Carlson -- &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re in,3171.434,1.435
charge of the various intelligence apparatus,3172.869,1.335
that report to you.,3174.204,0.667
You can ask them.&amp;quot; And he said --,3174.871,1.335
Mr. Spicer: And again --,3176.206,0.667
The Press: Can I ask my question?,3176.873,1.335
Mr. Spicer: Yeah.,3178.208,0.701
The Press: He said he was reluctant to do that.,3178.909,1.668
So let me just put two things together.,3180.577,2.869
"Earlier this week, you told us, when asked, &amp;quot;Has",3183.446,1.802
the President directed the Justice Department to,3185.248,2.469
collect and distribute information to the various,3187.717,2.469
relevant congressional committees?&amp;quot;,3190.186,1.335
"If I remember your answer correctly, it was, &amp;quot;No, we",3191.521,2.302
hadn&amp;#39;t given that specific direction.&amp;quot;,3193.823,1.802
Has that changed?,3195.625,0.701
Mr. Spicer: No.,3196.326,0.901
The Press: Has he now directed the,3197.227,1.368
Justice Department?,3198.595,0.667
Mr. Spicer: No.,3199.262,0.668
"The Press: And is he asking, himself, for the",3199.93,1.334
"intelligence agencies that report to him, to provide",3201.264,1.835
him specific answers to these underlying questions,3203.099,2.436
that are separate from the reports you&amp;#39;re citing?,3205.535,1.668
Mr. Spicer: No.,3207.203,0.701
The Press: Why not?,3207.904,0.901
Mr. Spicer: Because I think -- we&amp;#39;ve covered,3208.805,1.769
this before.,3210.574,0.7
"I think that gets into interfering, and I think",3211.274,2.369
that the appropriate process is to allow the,3213.643,2.036
House and the Senate to do this so that it doesn&amp;#39;t,3215.679,1.801
appear as though we&amp;#39;re interfering -- The Press:,3217.48,1.535
But interfering --,3219.015,0.668
Mr. Spicer: I understand that.,3219.683,0.667
"But I mentioned to you this the other day, Major.",3220.35,1.335
"If we go ask them, then you&amp;#39;re going to turn",3221.685,2.035
"around and say, you guys interfered with something",3223.72,1.835
and you pressured them.,3225.555,0.834
It&amp;#39;s a catch-22 for us.,3226.389,1.268
"And the bottom line is, is that I think the President",3227.657,1.735
made it clear two Sundays ago that he wanted the,3229.392,2.069
House and Senate Intelligence Committee to,3231.461,1.735
work with these agencies to collect the information,3233.196,2.035
and make a report.,3235.231,0.935
"That&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re doing, in order to make sure that",3236.166,2.502
there is a separation from us so that you can&amp;#39;t turn,3238.668,1.969
around and then accuse us of forcing or pressuring,3240.637,3.47
an agency to produce a document.,3244.107,1.869
We&amp;#39;re asking them to go through the process of the,3245.976,2.902
"separation of powers, and actually going to those",3248.878,4.939
different entities.,3253.817,0.7
"The Department of Justice said, yesterday, that they",3254.517,1.702
"want an additional week, and we&amp;#39;re allowing that",3256.219,2.202
process to play through.,3258.421,0.968
Got it? Abby.,3259.389,1.435
"The Press: Sean, is the President making these",3260.824,3.804
statements based on classified information?,3264.628,2.402
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to get into what how the,3267.03,2.769
President makes a decision.,3269.799,0.968
I think that what I think is clear though is --,3270.767,1.935
through the reporting that I just read -- is that,3272.702,1.435
there&amp;#39;s clearly widespread open-source material,3274.137,3.203
pointing to surveillance that was conducted during,3277.34,2.736
the 2016 election.,3280.076,0.868
The Press: (Inaudible) that that information is,3280.944,2.235
available to members of the House and the Senate.,3283.179,1.902
"It&amp;#39;s public, as you noted.",3285.081,1.468
"They are looking at that same information, and they",3286.549,1.368
came to the conclusion that they have not seen --,3287.917,1.402
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, that&amp;#39;s not true.",3289.319,1.335
The Press: -- any evidence to back up the,3290.654,1.334
President&amp;#39;s claim.,3291.988,0.801
"So if there is other information, why won&amp;#39;t the",3292.789,2.035
President release it?,3294.824,0.801
"Mr. Spicer: Again, I&amp;#39;m not going to get",3295.625,2.036
into that yet.,3297.661,0.667
I think the President discussed that last night,3298.328,2.235
"on his interview, and we&amp;#39;ll let the",3300.563,2.403
process play out.,3302.966,0.701
I understand what he discussed -- The Press: He,3303.667,1.368
discussed these reports --,3305.035,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I understand what he discussed.,3305.702,1.335
They have clearances in the House and the Senate,3307.037,2.002
Intelligence Committees.,3309.039,1.001
They&amp;#39;re able to conduct this. Alexis.,3310.04,1.468
"The Press: Sean, I&amp;#39;d like to ask you about two",3311.508,2.102
"topics, but can you help us a little by calling on",3313.61,2.302
Peter right now?,3315.912,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: No, I&amp;#39;m going to --",3316.579,1.435
The Press: Call it --,3318.014,1.035
Mr. Spicer: I understand.,3319.049,1.334
I actually call the question.,3320.383,1.468
"Alexis, if you don&amp;#39;t want to answer the question I",3321.851,2.303
can call on somebody else.,3324.154,1.401
"The Press: Could you call on the New York Times, please?",3325.555,3.036
"Mr. Spicer: No, thank you. Gabi.",3328.591,1.635
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",3330.226,1.101
In the case that Judge Watson issued against the,3331.327,2.503
restraining order against Trump&amp;#39;s second travel --,3333.83,1.935
"sorry, the President&amp;#39;s second travel ban, he",3335.765,1.936
included one of the President&amp;#39;s tweets and,3337.701,1.935
this was also included in the Washington State case.,3339.636,2.469
"So I&amp;#39;m wondering, does it give the President any",3342.105,2.469
pause that this virtual paper trail is creating --,3344.574,2.503
is having an impact on advancing his agenda?,3347.077,2.202
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I mean, I think that the",3349.279,2.969
Department of Justice&amp;#39;s statement speaks for,3352.248,2.069
itself when it comes to that last night.,3354.317,1.468
But the federal law that I read out clearly gives the,3355.785,5.172
President the authority.,3360.957,0.768
This is what we argued during the first one.,3361.725,2.002
I think for a judge to ignore that statute and,3363.727,2.702
talk about tweets or interpreting something,3366.429,1.835
that happened during the campaign trail is not in,3368.264,3.671
keeping with how they&amp;#39;re supposed to,3371.935,1.601
interpret the law.,3373.536,0.768
I&amp;#39;m not going to continue to comment.,3374.304,2.202
We tailored that additional -- that second,3376.506,2.936
executive order to comply with the judge&amp;#39;s order.,3379.442,2.97
"I think -- so to go back now and to say, well,",3382.412,1.935
based on how the first order was conceived makes,3384.347,3.036
absolutely no sense.,3387.383,0.901
But I&amp;#39;m going to let the Department of Justice,3388.284,2.069
"litigate that, how they do it.",3390.353,1.668
The second order literally was tailored to the,3392.021,1.335
concerns that were rendered by the 9th,3393.356,1.335
Circuit in the first executive order.,3394.691,1.334
So for them to then turn around the make arguments,3396.025,1.368
that are non-germane seems kind of odd.,3397.393,5.172
But I&amp;#39;ll let the Department of,3402.565,4.838
Justice do that.,3407.403,2.436
Zeke.,3409.839,0.834
The Press: Is the President concerned that,3410.673,4.605
comments made by his staff came up in this lawsuit?,3415.278,4.805
"It shows comments by Stephen Miller, saying",3420.083,2.335
that the second travel ban would have roughly the,3422.418,3.003
"same policy outcome as the first, that was the intent",3425.421,3.304
that that was used by the judge in that case to sort,3428.725,4.004
of -- to get that (inaudible) yesterday.,3432.729,2.302
Is he concerned that there&amp;#39;s mixed messaging,3435.031,2.336
coming out of the West Wing on this ban?,3437.367,3.003
"Mr. Spicer: No, he&amp;#39;s not.",3440.37,1.668
And I think that the Department of Justice will,3442.038,2.836
be pursuing avenues that will seek to remedy this.,3444.874,4.838
I think when you read through the court&amp;#39;s ruling,3449.712,2.369
"in Hawaii in particular, it just doesn&amp;#39;t seem",3452.081,4.538
to make sense.,3456.619,0.701
"As I mentioned to Gabi, the second executive order",3457.32,3.303
was literally tailored.,3460.623,1.969
So to go back and talk about statements that,3462.592,2.336
"occurred, in some cases, well before even the first",3464.928,3.303
"one, seems to not be an",3468.231,2.069
accurate reading of the law.,3470.3,1.234
But I&amp;#39;ll let the Department of Justice be,3471.534,4.571
the ones that argue this and make the,3476.105,2.036
appropriate legal argument.,3478.141,0.934
Hunter.,3479.075,0.701
"Olivier, I&amp;#39;m sorry.",3479.776,1.068
The Press: I have one more for you.,3480.844,1.668
To go back to your long list of sort of news,3482.512,2.302
reports you mentioned -- one that you reached that,3484.814,1.769
perhaps the GCHQ was involved.,3486.583,2.002
Did the President ever raise this in his,3488.585,3.27
conversation with Theresa May?,3491.855,1.634
"And if that were to pan out, would that imperil",3493.489,1.869
the special relationship between the two?,3495.358,1.368
"Mr. Spicer: Again, these are just -- that happened",3496.726,2.369
I think two days ago.,3499.095,1.235
It was something that was reported on air.,3500.33,1.535
"I think the point is, is that there&amp;#39;s been --",3501.865,1.901
The Press: Was it raised --,3503.766,1.135
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, it has not been raised.",3504.901,1.535
"But I do think that, again, we&amp;#39;re not -- all",3506.436,3.737
we&amp;#39;re doing is literally reading off what other,3510.173,2.302
"stations and people have reported, and I think that",3512.475,2.503
casts into concern some of the activities that may,3514.978,2.869
have occurred during the &amp;#39;16 election.,3517.847,2.136
We&amp;#39;re not casting judgment on that.,3519.983,1.568
I think the idea is to say that if these,3521.551,2.336
"organizations, these individuals came to these",3523.887,2.335
"conclusions, they merit looking into.",3526.222,3.103
Olivier.,3529.325,0.701
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",3530.026,0.667
I got a couple for you.,3530.693,0.668
There&amp;#39;s a news report about the President&amp;#39;s,3531.361,2.736
meeting with the Saudi Defense Minister/Deputy,3534.097,2.769
Crown Prince that says that the defense minister,3536.866,3.737
"told the President about a plot, a terrorist plot",3540.603,2.336
against the United States.,3542.939,1.335
Did that happen?,3544.274,1.034
What&amp;#39;s the nature of that?,3545.308,1.735
How worried should Americans be?,3547.043,1.335
Mr. Spicer: We&amp;#39;re obviously never going to,3548.378,2.402
comment on any kind of specific threats,3550.78,2.769
to the homeland.,3553.549,1.202
We&amp;#39;re obviously committed to ensuring the safety,3554.751,2.102
of every American.,3556.853,1.501
But it should be no secret that we share intelligence,3558.354,2.87
"amongst a variety of countries, and so we would",3561.224,3.07
never comment on a potential threat,3564.294,1.935
or not that existed.,3566.229,1.435
But we appreciate several countries that we work,3567.664,4.271
with closely to make sure that we do what we can to,3571.935,2.268
protect the homeland.,3574.203,0.701
The Press: One more.,3574.904,2.136
Secretary Tillerson in Asia said that 20 years of,3577.04,3.203
diplomatic efforts have failed to get,3580.243,2.469
North Korea to denuclearize.,3582.712,1.201
"That&amp;#39;s plainly true, but the question I guess that",3583.913,3.237
comes up is does the President plan a break,3587.15,2.836
from diplomacy altogether?,3589.986,1.268
Are we looking now at only the use of force or some,3591.254,2.869
other coercive measures?,3594.123,0.701
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to comment.,3594.824,2.102
I think the President never takes,3596.926,1.869
anything off the table.,3598.795,1.268
"That&amp;#39;s something he&amp;#39;s been very clear about, and",3600.063,2.636
-- with that.,3602.699,0.834
Blake.,3603.533,0.667
"The Press: Sean, over the course of the campaign the",3604.2,2.603
President made a couple different -- many comments,3606.803,2.102
about the budget and the deficit.,3608.905,1.568
"At one point, he said he thought that he could get",3610.473,2.836
rid of the national debt,3613.309,1.301
over the course of eight years.,3614.61,1.635
At another point he said that he would insist on a,3616.245,3.838
balanced budget relatively soon.,3620.083,2.402
Now the base line that the administration is giving,3622.485,2.97
"us is, well at least we&amp;#39;re not adding onto the",3625.455,2.068
"deficit, which is nearly half a trillion dollars.",3627.523,2.87
So I&amp;#39;m curious as to how we got from that point to,3630.393,2.97
"now, to where -- he was talking at one point about",3633.363,2.702
"eliminating a bunch, and now it&amp;#39;s adding onto it.",3636.065,1.969
Mr. Spicer: I think Director Mulvaney,3638.034,1.335
addressed that.,3639.369,0.667
"I think -- look, a couple things.",3640.036,1.902
"Number one, the Senate dragged its feet on",3641.938,1.935
getting Director Mulvaney confirmed and in office.,3643.873,3.504
So I think we were way -- we were behind the curve,3647.377,1.668
in having a director of OMB.,3649.045,2.369
We got in here -- I think we produced a blueprint,3651.414,2.836
that is consistent with the President&amp;#39;s principles,3654.25,1.969
and priorities.,3656.219,1.501
But he&amp;#39;s already made it very clear that we&amp;#39;ll have,3657.72,1.535
a budget probably sometime in May that will outline,3659.255,3.37
"the more specifics of the revenue piece, the",3662.625,2.169
"entitlement piece, and the full details of all this.",3664.794,3.303
But eliminating a $20 trillion debt and tackling,3668.097,3.837
the current deficit is something that&amp;#39;s going to,3671.934,2.77
take a little bit of time and something that the,3674.704,1.335
President is committed to reducing.,3676.039,1.334
I think we&amp;#39;ve talked very extensively about the,3677.373,2.603
President&amp;#39;s commitment to protecting taxpayer,3679.976,2.402
dollars and using them more efficiently.,3682.378,1.835
This budget and a lot of the action the President,3684.213,2.703
"took on other projects, including the F18 and the",3686.916,3.737
"next generation of AF1, show that the President is",3690.653,3.17
"committed on a very, very personal basis to getting",3693.823,3.036
involved in programs and policies to reduce the,3696.859,4.705
deficit and respect taxpayer money.,3701.564,1.535
"So this is step one, and it&amp;#39;s a down payment on",3703.099,2.602
that goal.,3705.701,0.668
The Press: Are there future steps -- there are,3706.369,2.035
"lots of cuts in here, but no matter which way you",3708.404,1.935
"splice the numbers, anyone will tell you, if you want",3710.339,2.069
to drop it somehow you&amp;#39;ve got to,3712.408,1.335
get to entitlements.,3713.743,0.901
Mr. Spicer: I understand.,3714.644,0.7
"The Press: Is that on the table potentially,",3715.344,2.47
yes or no?,3717.814,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: As Director Mulvaney put it, he was",3718.481,2.736
chosen for this job because of his commitment,3721.217,3.103
to fiscal austerity and respect of taxpayer,3724.32,2.503
dollars and budgeting skills.,3726.823,2.035
And I think that we&amp;#39;ve got to get passed today.,3728.858,2.636
Let us get down that and we&amp;#39;ll have more for you.,3731.494,1.969
"But again, I think this budget is a huge down",3733.463,2.602
payment on the President&amp;#39;s goal of showing his,3736.065,2.369
commitment to fiscal responsibility and,3738.434,1.669
respecting the taxpayer. Eamon.,3740.103,1.034
"The Press: Sean, tax day is coming up.",3741.137,2.102
A lot of Americans put,3743.239,1.301
together their tax returns.,3744.54,1.035
When the President puts together his tax returns,3745.575,2.102
"this year, will he release it publicly?",3747.677,1.835
"Presumably he&amp;#39;s not under audit, right?",3749.512,1.702
"Mr. Spicer: Well, St. Patrick&amp;#39;s Day is",3751.214,2.369
tomorrow -- that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m more focused on.,3753.583,1.334
"The Press: Presumably, his 2016 returns are",3754.917,1.368
not under audit yet.,3756.285,0.668
Mr. Spicer: Right.,3756.953,0.667
"Again, we&amp;#39;ll cross that bridge when",3757.62,1.335
it comes to it.,3758.955,0.667
I think the President has been very clear about his,3759.622,1.335
"position on his tax returns, and we&amp;#39;ll have to",3760.957,1.334
see where it goes from there.,3762.291,0.668
But the President has been very clear throughout the,3762.959,5.739
campaign and consistent that he&amp;#39;s under,3768.698,1.535
a routine audit. John.,3770.233,1.234
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",3771.467,2.936
Reading the draft of the budget and listening to,3774.403,3.37
Director Mulvaney&amp;#39;s comments yesterday and,3777.773,2.002
"today, it would appear that the National",3779.775,2.236
Endowment of the Arts would be phased out,3782.011,2.536
entirely in two years.,3784.547,1.935
Can you name any other government programs or,3786.482,3.57
even Cabinet departments -- such as Housing and,3790.052,3.571
"Urban Development, and Education -- in which its",3793.623,3.603
entire function may be phased out or reduced to,3797.226,3.37
another agency in government or,3800.596,2.269
even the state?,3802.865,1.168
"Mr. Spicer: John, those here from OMB is the",3804.033,2.803
appropriate person to ask on that.,3806.836,1.368
I know that they&amp;#39;ve done several briefings,3808.204,1.735
on the budget.,3809.939,1.201
We can have OMB definitely get back to you on this.,3811.14,2.636
If you can contact him after this. Kaitlan.,3813.776,3.637
The Press: Going back to the fact that the,3817.413,2.503
"President used &amp;quot;wiretap&amp;quot; in quotes, and last night",3819.916,2.335
he said it was very important that it was in,3822.251,2.236
"quotes, but out of the four tweets when he",3824.487,2.869
accuses Barack Obama of wiretapping him he only,3827.356,2.269
used quotes in two of them.,3829.625,0.968
In two of them he specifically said that he,3830.593,2.436
tapped his phones.,3833.029,0.834
"He didn&amp;#39;t use the term, wiretapping.",3833.863,1.668
"And just minutes ago, you said it was communications",3835.531,1.802
being swept up.,3837.333,1.168
So can you definitively say that he still feels,3838.501,2.269
"like Barack Obama wiretapped Trump Tower, or",3840.77,2.669
does he feel like it was broadly surveilled?,3843.439,1.368
Which is it?,3844.807,0.701
"Mr. Spicer: Look, he was very clear about",3845.508,1.334
this last night.,3846.842,0.668
"He talked about it, as you said --",3847.51,1.334
The Press: He wasn&amp;#39;t --,3848.844,0.701
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, he was.",3849.545,0.834
"He said that he meant it, he put it in quotes, it was very broad.",3850.379,3.27
And so that&amp;#39;s what he meant by the use,3853.649,2.436
of the term.,3856.085,0.667
The Press: But was it phone-tapping? Was it --,3856.752,3.904
"Mr. Spicer: No, it was surveillance.",3860.656,1.335
I think we&amp;#39;ve covered this like 10 times.,3861.991,1.335
The Press: There&amp;#39;s no specific answer,3863.326,1.368
of what it was. What did President Obama do to --,3864.694,2.102
"Mr. Spicer: I understand that,",3866.796,0.901
but that&amp;#39;s the point of them,3867.697,0.667
"looking into this, Kaitlan.",3868.364,0.801
"I think the idea is to look into this, have the",3869.165,3.136
House and Senate Intelligence Committees,3872.301,1.669
look into this and report back.,3873.97,1.167
The Press: I want to follow up on that.,3875.137,3.838
If all this comes out and there&amp;#39;s no proof that,3878.975,2.669
"President Obama had any role in any wiretapping,",3881.644,3.47
"if there was no wiretapping, will",3885.114,1.335
President Trump then offer an apology,3886.449,1.334
to President Obama?,3887.783,0.701
Mr. Spicer: I was asked this like three times this,3888.484,2.102
week and I think the answer is we&amp;#39;re not going,3890.586,1.769
to prejudge what the outcome of this is.,3892.355,1.935
"I think we&amp;#39;ve got to let the process work its will,",3894.29,4.037
and then when there&amp;#39;s a report that comes out,3898.327,1.368
"conclusive from there, then we&amp;#39;ll be",3899.695,1.368
able to comment.,3901.063,0.668
But to jump ahead of this process at this point,3901.731,2.335
would be inappropriate.,3904.066,1.101
"And I go to Bryan Crabtree of Salem Radio, Georgia.",3905.167,3.637
"The Press: Thank you, Sean, for taking questions",3908.804,3.103
from a talk-radio host right here in Georgia and,3911.907,4.004
not in the D.C. swamp.,3915.911,1.268
"First, I have two questions.",3917.179,2.236
"First, to the President&amp;#39;s tax returns and",3919.415,3.17
classified information.,3922.585,0.967
President Trump campaigned on draining the swamp.,3923.552,3.771
The American people then want to know why he,3927.323,3.003
(inaudible).,3930.326,0.968
And Commissioner (inaudible) has not yet,3931.294,2.736
been fired by the Trump administration.,3934.03,1.868
My second question is with regard to there are --,3935.898,2.136
many conservatives are really concerned that Paul,3938.034,3.87
"Ryan, the Speaker of the House, is leading",3941.904,2.369
President Trump down a very wrong path,3944.273,2.703
on healthcare.,3946.976,1.368
How do you react to that?,3948.344,1.001
"Mr. Spicer: Well, on the first one, there&amp;#39;s no",3949.345,1.902
personnel updates with respect to -- with the,3951.247,3.07
exception of the ones that I mentioned today.,3954.317,2.035
"On the second, Donald Trump is not one to be led",3956.352,2.569
down a path by anyone.,3958.921,1.535
I think he is -- he talked today at the lunch with,3960.456,3.971
the Taoiseach and Speaker Ryan that he&amp;#39;s working,3964.427,3.336
hand-in-glove with the Speaker.,3967.763,2.97
He talked about it last night.,3970.733,1.635
This is a commitment that he has to,3972.368,1.835
enacting healthcare.,3974.203,1.301
"This is a process that he is committed to, wants to",3975.504,4.505
see through because of a goal that he wants to,3980.009,1.601
"achieve, which is making a more patient-centric",3981.61,1.969
healthcare system that lowers the cost and,3983.579,2.269
increases the options.,3985.848,0.767
But he doesn&amp;#39;t get led down any path.,3986.615,3.003
He leads very clearly.,3989.618,1.569
"And I think if you listen to Speaker Ryan today,",3991.187,2.936
he&amp;#39;s in agreement that there&amp;#39;s been a strong,3994.123,3.637
"partnership between the House, the administration",3997.76,3.236
and I think the Senate so far to make sure that we,4000.996,2.436
get this bill done.,4003.432,0.834
"And that&amp;#39;s what our goal is going to be, and that&amp;#39;s",4004.266,2.937
-- so I would argue that we&amp;#39;ve actually done a,4007.203,1.601
pretty good job of getting that done. Jonathan.,4008.804,2.202
The Press: I want to ask you about the decision to,4011.006,2.503
cut the National Institutes of Health,4013.509,2.102
budget by 19 percent.,4015.611,1.802
"It&amp;#39;s, as you know, a very important part of the",4017.413,5.405
government funding medical research.,4022.818,2.169
Budget Director Mulvaney yesterday acknowledged,4024.987,2.836
that the private sector can&amp;#39;t fill that gap.,4027.823,2.336
"When there are rare diseases, we do need a",4030.159,2.669
really robust government presence.,4032.828,2.036
The President invited a rare-disease patient to,4034.864,2.269
his speech to Congress to talk about,4037.133,1.701
medical innovation.,4038.834,1.001
How do you square those things when you&amp;#39;re cutting,4039.835,3.671
NIH by 19 percent?,4043.506,1.735
And many conservatives actually wanted to,4045.241,1.601
increase the budget.,4046.842,0.968
Mr. Spicer: I think Director Mulvaney actually,4047.81,2.002
-- somebody asked him during the Q&amp;amp;A period the,4049.812,2.636
same question.,4052.448,0.667
The Press: But he suggested that it wouldn&amp;#39;t,4053.115,1.335
-- like my take from listening to him yesterday,4054.45,1.935
was that it wouldn&amp;#39;t be cut.,4056.385,1.769
"I mean, I almost wrote that.",4058.154,1.167
"Mr. Spicer: There&amp;#39;s this assumption in Washington,",4059.321,1.435
"Jonathan, that if you get less money it&amp;#39;s a cut.",4060.756,2.87
And I think that the reality is that in a lot,4063.626,2.035
"of these there&amp;#39;s efficiencies, duplicity,",4065.661,2.636
ways to spend money better.,4068.297,1.702
"And I think if you&amp;#39;re wasting a lot of money,",4069.999,2.369
that&amp;#39;s not a true dollar spent.,4072.368,2.035
And I think when you look at the way that Director,4074.403,2.336
"Mulvaney and the President approached this budget, it",4076.739,2.769
was can we ask -- can we get more with the same,4079.508,3.237
"dollar, can we find duplicity, can we find",4082.745,1.802
"efficiencies, can we combine facilities in some",4084.547,3.637
cases at NIH to enhance a better experience whereby,4088.184,5.272
we actually have an outcome that&amp;#39;s,4093.456,1.768
reduced savings.,4095.224,0.701
But to assume that because you spend a ton of dollars,4095.925,2.702
"you&amp;#39;re going to get a better outcome, I mean,",4098.627,2.636
"with all due respect, you look at the District of",4101.263,2.002
"Columbia, they spend by far more per capita than",4103.265,3.337
"any other city in the country on education, and",4106.602,2.803
I think they have tremendous issues that are,4109.405,3.07
constantly being dealt with in their,4112.475,1.334
education system.,4113.809,1.001
So to assume that just because you throw money at,4114.81,1.769
a problem it&amp;#39;s somehow magically solved is a very,4116.579,3.47
Washington way of looking at a budget problem.,4120.049,2.169
The Press: But they believe --,4122.218,1.501
"Mr. Spicer: I understand that,",4123.719,1.135
and I think part of the issues,4124.854,1.468
that we&amp;#39;re working -- as the Director outlined a,4126.322,2.569
"couple weeks ago during the passback process, is",4128.891,1.868
to work with them to talk to each of these agencies,4130.759,3.137
and departments about how to walk through their,4133.896,1.802
budget in a way that ensures they can continue,4135.698,3.27
to do the core functions that they want while,4138.968,2.869
"finding ways to reduce waste, get rid of --",4141.837,2.536
enhance efficiencies and get rid of duplicity.,4144.373,3.37
But that is a very Washington way of looking,4147.743,2.603
"at a problem, when you say, let&amp;#39;s just look at",4150.346,2.702
how much we spend as a measure of how much we,4153.048,2.636
care or how much we&amp;#39;re going to get done.,4155.684,2.002
And I think that the President has been very,4157.686,1.535
clear as to what his priorities on this budget,4159.221,1.669
are and the outcomes that we expect from every,4160.89,2.335
dollar that we spend.,4163.225,1.201
"So for being in office for 55 days, or 50-some-odd",4164.426,3.737
"days, whatever it&amp;#39;s been, we&amp;#39;ve had a unique ability",4168.163,2.436
to go forward so far and make a very strong,4170.599,3.904
"commitment to enhancing our national security, to",4174.503,2.836
protect the country and to keep America safe and its,4177.339,1.936
"citizens safe, while at the same time making sure",4179.275,2.435
"that we don&amp;#39;t ask for people to work harder, to",4181.71,2.87
spend more to Washington -- send more to Washington,4184.58,2.469
that gets ultimately wasted.,4187.049,1.201
I just don&amp;#39;t see how that&amp;#39;s showing respect to,4188.25,2.469
"the American people or to the American taxpayer,",4190.719,1.969
"especially when so many people are working two,",4192.688,2.269
"sometimes three jobs, or both parents are working",4194.957,4.538
"just to get by, pay the mortgage, and we&amp;#39;re",4199.495,2.869
"saying, hey, don&amp;#39;t worry, keep sending more money to",4202.364,1.735
Washington -- and we&amp;#39;re not going to,4204.099,1.368
take the time.,4205.467,0.668
But there should be a review of all,4206.135,1.368
these agencies.,4207.503,0.801
Director Mulvaney was pointing out how many,4208.304,2.335
unauthorized agencies and departments and programs,4210.639,2.836
we have throughout the government.,4213.475,1.335
"If we&amp;#39;re going to do that, at some point there should",4214.81,1.769
be a debate on whether or not these agencies and,4216.579,3.236
programs are achieving their mission.,4219.815,3.27
"And if they are then great, fund them.",4223.085,1.835
"But if they&amp;#39;re not, we shouldn&amp;#39;t be asking",4224.92,1.835
hardworking American taxpayers to send more,4226.755,2.269
money to Washington to fund things that don&amp;#39;t,4229.024,2.369
further those goals.,4231.393,0.768
Thank you guys very much.,4232.161,1.768
I look forward to seeing you all tomorrow.,4233.929,1.769
Take care.,4235.698,4.437
Have a good one.,4240.135,5.005
