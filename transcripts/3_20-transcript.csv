Mr. Spicer: Good afternoon.,3.7,1.32
"As you all know, the President will be speaking",5.02,2.34
"this afternoon in Louisville, and we&amp;#39;ve got",7.52,1.54
"an event coming up, so I&amp;#39;ll try to keep this",9.18,2.76
relatively short to focus on -- let the President,11.945,2.502
focus on his message for the day.,14.447,2.87
"In regard to the news of the day, this morning,",17.317,3.336
"after receiving his daily intelligence briefing, the",20.653,2.369
"President met with Bill Gates, the co-chair and",23.022,2.67
trustee of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.,25.692,2.803
The President and Mr. Gates talked about,28.495,2.102
their shared commitment to finding and stopping,30.597,1.968
disease outbreaks around the world.,32.565,2.303
The President particularly commended Mr. Gates for,34.868,4.17
the Gates Foundation&amp;#39;s work in global health and,39.038,2.636
health security.,41.674,1.335
Generous and innovative private philanthropy,43.009,2.236
"groups, like the Gates Foundation, are critical",45.245,3.203
to our mission of finding the cures of tomorrow.,48.448,2.636
"Also this morning, the confirmation hearings in",51.084,2.302
the Judiciary Committee began for the President&amp;#39;s,53.386,4.304
"nominee for the Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch.",57.69,2.636
As the judge will continue to show throughout this,60.326,1.335
"process, he&amp;#39;s eminently qualified for this",61.661,1.335
"position, with impeccable academic credentials, a",62.996,1.368
"brilliant legal mind, and a proven commitment to the",64.364,1.334
Constitution.,65.698,0.668
"On Tuesday and Wednesday, Judge Gorsuch will be",66.366,1.334
questioned by each member of the panel.,67.7,1.335
"And on Thursday, we anticipate things to",69.035,1.335
conclude with a panel of witnesses.,70.37,1.334
The President was glad to see so many people convey,71.704,5.005
their support in the last few days for Judge,82.982,2.436
Gorsuch.,85.418,1.035
"Just this past weekend, Senator Grassley, former",86.453,2.502
"New York Mayor Bloomberg, editorial boards from",88.955,2.936
"across the country, and several of his former",91.891,1.769
colleagues and classmates either penned op-eds and,93.66,2.869
"editorials or provided comments, one way or",96.529,2.503
"another, stating his impeccable qualifications",99.032,3.703
for the bench.,102.735,1.702
"They add to the long list of jurists, politicians,",104.437,2.669
and elected officials from both sides of the aisle,107.106,2.57
who have already given the judge their support.,109.676,2.502
The President looks forward to watching Judge,112.178,1.468
Gorsuch continue to show the Senate what an,113.646,2.403
"extraordinary addition he will be to the bench, and",116.049,2.436
is confident that he will be confirmed.,118.485,2.435
"Later in the morning, the President had a meeting",120.92,1.535
"with Speaker Ryan, Secretary of Health and",122.455,2.369
"Human Services Dr. Tom Price,",124.824,2.236
and Dr. Zeke Emanuel.,127.06,1.768
Dr. Emanuel has been intimately involved in,128.828,1.969
crafting healthcare policy since his,130.797,1.568
work on Obamacare.,132.365,0.801
"Obviously, he and the President have some",133.166,3.103
differing views on the best way to make,136.269,3.403
"healthcare affordable and accessible, but the",139.672,2.002
President also strongly believes that the health,141.674,2.169
and wellbeing of the American people shouldn&amp;#39;t,143.843,2.036
"always be a partisan issue, and he will",145.879,1.635
continue to reach across party lines and listen to,147.514,3.036
voices on this issue.,150.55,1.068
Last week he heard from individuals and families,151.618,2.669
who have suffered from the disastrous,154.287,2.369
results of Obamacare.,156.656,1.268
"He&amp;#39;s previously spoken to healthcare policy groups,",157.924,2.803
"Republican congressional leadership, and health",160.727,2.502
insurance companies.,163.229,1.335
"This week, he and his staff will have",164.564,1.501
discussions on women in healthcare while,166.065,2.203
continuing an open dialogue with,168.268,1.534
members of Congress.,169.802,1.802
And he will be hosting even more meetings and,171.604,2.736
listening sessions in the coming weeks as he works,174.34,2.703
with Congress to bring commonsense reforms to our,177.043,1.969
healthcare system.,179.012,1.334
The President has shown that he&amp;#39;s willing to hear,180.346,1.535
"from all stakeholders in the healthcare field, and",181.881,2.67
he will continue to listen as the process on the,184.551,2.769
American Health Care Act moves along and we pursue,187.32,3.07
the additional legislative and administrative,190.39,2.269
actions necessary.,192.659,1.568
"This afternoon, the President had lunch with",194.227,1.668
"the Vice President, and as we speak he&amp;#39;s meeting with",195.895,2.77
Secretary of State Tillerson.,198.665,1.735
The Secretary just returned from an,200.4,1.501
important trip to Asia.,201.901,1.935
He made it clear that America is committed to,203.836,1.769
"our allies, Japan and the Republic of Korea, and",205.605,3.17
that we expect China to increase its role in,208.775,2.102
persuading North Korea to move away from nuclear,210.877,2.669
weapon and ballistic missile development and,213.546,2.136
toward steps to create a better future for the,215.682,2.335
North Korean people.,218.017,1.602
This trip set the stage for future leader-level,219.619,2.869
engagement between the U.S. and China.,222.488,3.104
"During this meeting, he will debrief the",225.592,1.668
President on his trip.,227.26,1.868
"Later this afternoon, the President will welcome",229.128,1.936
Prime Minister al-Abadi of Iraq.,231.064,3.136
The Iraqi people have been a brave and steadfast,234.2,2.136
"partner in our shared fight against ISIS, al",236.336,2.435
"Qaeda, and radicalism.",238.771,1.702
The President will speak with the Prime Minister,240.473,1.568
about how that partnership will help us defeat ISIS,242.041,2.736
and move into a new era in which Iraq is a force for,244.777,2.903
stability and peace and a prosperous Middle East.,247.68,3.537
After his bilateral meeting with the Prime,251.217,1.602
"Minister, the President will depart the White",252.819,2.135
"House for Louisville, Kentucky for a Make",254.954,2.269
America Great Again Rally before returning to the,257.223,2.803
White House later this evening.,260.026,1.702
A few notes at the end before I take,261.728,1.668
some questions.,263.396,1.435
"Yesterday, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin returned",264.831,2.536
"from a very successful trip to Europe, where he",267.367,2.202
stopped in the UK for a bilateral with the,269.569,2.335
"Chancellor of the Exchequer, and later met",271.904,2.169
with 18 of his counterparts during the,274.073,1.969
G20 Ministerial in Baden-Baden.,276.042,3.07
This trip gave the Secretary an opportunity,279.112,2.435
to outline the administration&amp;#39;s,281.547,1.268
"priorities on a number of issues, including",282.815,2.102
"macroeconomic policy, financial regulation,",284.917,2.903
"international tax, and illicit finance.",287.82,2.837
"During the meetings, the Secretary and his",290.657,1.401
counterparts presented a platform that will,292.058,1.702
strengthen our collective work on steps to promote,293.76,2.736
global growth and financial stability.,296.496,2.102
In terms of the schedule for the rest of the week,298.598,2.102
"-- tomorrow, the President will sign S.",300.7,1.668
"442, &amp;quot;The National Aeronautics and Space",302.368,3.17
Administration Transition Authorization Act of 2017&amp;quot;,305.538,3.47
"in the morning, and make remarks at the National",309.008,2.236
Republican Congressional Committee March,311.244,2.202
Dinner in the evening.,313.446,1.368
"On Wednesday, as I mentioned last week, the",314.814,1.835
President will meet with,316.649,0.834
the Congressional Black Caucus.,317.483,1.635
"On Thursday, the President will hold an event with",319.118,2.136
truck drivers and representatives from the,321.254,1.601
trucking companies and industry on healthcare and,322.855,2.87
its negative impacts on their industry and,325.725,2.669
"livelihood, which just happens to be the largest",328.394,3.37
employer in 29 states.,331.764,1.669
"And on Friday, the President will hold a",333.433,1.401
Greek Independence Day celebration.,334.834,2.402
We&amp;#39;ll have further updates on all of,337.236,2.303
those events later.,339.539,1.535
"And finally, I want to address the House",341.074,2.035
Intelligence Committee hearing that is currently,343.109,2.836
happening in which the FBI director and the NSA,345.945,2.369
director are currently testifying and comment to,348.314,2.469
the extent that I can at this time.,350.783,2.002
"This hearing, as Chairman Nunes noted, is the first",352.785,2.736
of several that the House Intelligence Committee is,355.521,1.936
"engaged in, and the President is happy that",357.457,2.202
they&amp;#39;re pursuing the facts in this.,359.659,2.169
"As has been previously reported, Director Comey",361.828,4.17
confirmed that the FBI is investigating Russia&amp;#39;s,365.998,2.236
role in interfering with the election.,368.234,2.369
And let me just comment briefly on that.,370.603,2.536
"Following this testimony, it&amp;#39;s clear that",373.139,2.035
nothing has changed.,375.174,1.268
Senior Obama intelligence officials have gone on,376.442,2.303
record to confirm that there is no evidence of a,378.745,2.469
Trump-Russia collusion.,381.214,1.968
"The Obama CIA director said so, Obama&amp;#39;s director",383.182,3.103
"of national intelligence said so, and we take",386.285,2.403
them at their word.,388.688,1.068
"However, there was some new information that came",389.756,1.668
from the hearing that we believe is,391.424,1.368
newsworthy about the intelligence-gathering,392.792,1.468
process and the unmasking of Americans identified in,394.26,3.837
"intelligence reports, and the illegal leak of such",398.097,3.003
"unmasked individuals, which is a federal crime.",401.1,3.103
Director Comey told the House Intelligence,404.203,1.835
Committee that certain political appointees in,406.038,2.103
the Obama administration had access to the,408.141,2.335
names of unmasked U.S.,410.476,1.302
"citizens, such as senior White House officials,",411.778,2.902
"senior Department of Justice officials, and",414.68,2.57
senior intelligence officials.,417.25,1.835
"Before President Obama left office, Michael Flynn",419.085,2.736
was unmasked and then illegally his identify was,421.821,3.27
"leaked out to media outlets, despite the fact",425.091,2.836
"that, as NSA Director Rogers said, that",427.927,2.669
unmasking and revealing individuals endangers,430.596,3.137
&amp;quot;national security.&amp;quot; Not only was General Flynn&amp;#39;s,433.733,4.104
"identify made available, Director Comey refused to",437.837,2.502
answer the question of whether or not he&amp;#39;d,440.339,2.703
actually briefed President Obama on his phone,443.042,2.503
calls and activities.,445.545,0.667
Director Comey called these types of disclosures,446.212,1.335
of classified information a threat to national,447.547,1.368
"security, and said he will investigate and pursue",448.915,1.334
these matters to the full extent of law.,450.249,1.335
He also said that the leaking of classified,451.584,1.335
information had become &amp;quot;unusually active&amp;quot; in the,452.919,1.334
timeframe in question.,454.253,0.668
It&amp;#39;s also important to note that both Directors,454.921,1.334
Comey and Rogers told the committee that they have,456.255,1.368
no evidence that votes were changed in the,457.623,1.335
swing states the President had won.,458.958,4.872
"I think that pretty much, until we get the ending of",463.83,5.005
this hearing -- I don&amp;#39;t know that I want to,476.409,2.102
comment too much further.,478.511,1.501
"And with that, I&amp;#39;d be glad to take a few questions.",480.012,2.136
Jonathan.,482.148,0.667
"The Press: Sean, does the President still have",482.815,2.269
complete confidence in FBI Director Comey?,485.084,2.035
Mr. Spicer: There&amp;#39;s no reason to believe he,487.119,2.169
doesn&amp;#39;t at this time.,489.288,0.901
John.,490.189,0.668
"The Press: You said -- wait, hold on --",490.857,1.735
Mr. Spicer: I answered you.,492.592,1.301
The Press: He said that there is no information to,493.893,2.269
support the allegations that the President made,496.162,1.635
against President Obama.,497.797,1.334
Mr. Spicer: At this time.,499.131,1.068
The Press: So is the President prepared to,500.199,2.503
withdraw that accusation and apologize,502.702,1.334
to the President?,504.036,0.768
"Mr. Spicer: No, we started a hearing.",504.804,1.835
It&amp;#39;s still ongoing.,506.639,0.767
"And, as Chairman Nunes mentioned, this is one in",507.406,3.17
a series of hearings that will be happening.,510.576,4.538
"As I noted last week, there&amp;#39;s also a lot of",515.114,2.569
interesting news coming out of that in terms of,517.683,2.269
the activities that have gone on to reveal the,519.952,2.536
information on American citizens that have been,522.488,1.735
"part of this, particularly General Flynn.",524.223,2.369
There&amp;#39;s a lot of things that aren&amp;#39;t being covered,526.592,2.269
in this hearing that I think are interesting that,528.861,4.738
"-- since it&amp;#39;s ongoing, I&amp;#39;ll leave that for now.",533.599,1.869
But I think there&amp;#39;s a lot of areas that still,535.468,2.836
need to be covered.,538.304,1.168
There&amp;#39;s a lot of information that still,539.472,1.368
needs to be discussed.,540.84,0.934
The Press: The director also said he&amp;#39;s,541.774,1.335
investigating the links and the possibility of,543.109,2.969
coordination between the Trump campaign,546.078,2.036
and the Russians.,548.114,2.402
Given that the President just this morning said,550.516,2.035
"that the Democrats made up the Russia story, why",552.551,3.771
would the FBI director be investigating a,556.322,1.668
story if it&amp;#39;s simply --,557.99,1.135
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s what he said.,559.125,1.568
"But again, look at what -- The Press: No, no, he did.",560.693,1.602
He said that he&amp;#39;s investigating the nature,562.295,1.601
of any links between individuals associated,563.896,2.269
with the Trump campaign and the Russian,566.165,1.368
"government, and whether or not there",567.533,1.335
was any coordination.,568.868,0.801
Mr. Spicer: Correct.,569.669,0.734
"But again, investigating it and having proof of it",570.403,2.302
are two different things.,572.705,0.801
"If you look at the acting Obama CIA director, he",573.506,2.903
said that there&amp;#39;s smoke but there&amp;#39;s no fire.,576.409,2.035
Senator Tom Cotton -- &amp;quot;Not that I&amp;#39;ve seen and not,578.444,2.669
that I&amp;#39;m aware of.&amp;quot; You look at Director Clapper,581.113,2.703
-- &amp;quot;Not to my knowledge.&amp;quot;,583.816,1.368
"Senator Chris Coons, Democrat from Delaware --",585.184,2.069
&amp;quot;I have no evidence of collusion.&amp;quot;,587.253,2.469
There&amp;#39;s a point at which you continue to search for,589.722,2.236
something that everybody who&amp;#39;s been briefed,591.958,2.302
hasn&amp;#39;t seen or found.,594.26,2.436
"I think it&amp;#39;s fine to look into it, but at the end of",596.696,2.369
"the day, they&amp;#39;re going to come to the same",599.065,1.334
conclusion that everybody else has had.,600.399,1.669
"So you can continue to look for something, but",602.068,3.036
continuing to look for something that doesn&amp;#39;t,605.104,1.501
exist doesn&amp;#39;t matter.,606.605,1.602
There is a discussion -- I heard some names thrown,608.207,2.202
around before -- that were hangers-on or on the,610.409,3.537
"campaign, and I think at some point people that got",613.946,3.604
"thrown around at the beginning of this hearing,",617.55,2.402
"some of those names, the greatest amount of",619.952,2.269
interaction that they&amp;#39;ve had has had,622.221,2.002
cease-and-desist letters sent to them.,624.223,1.869
The Press: You&amp;#39;re talking about the Roger Stones and,626.092,2.469
the Carter Pages.,628.561,0.801
"Mr. Spicer: Exactly, the Carter Pages, yes.",629.362,1.968
"But those people, the greatest amount of",631.33,1.435
interaction that they had with the campaign was the,632.765,2.169
campaign apparently sending them a series of,634.934,1.968
cease-and-desist letters.,636.902,1.836
"So again, I think that when you read a lot of",638.738,2.235
"this activity about associates, there is a",640.973,2.603
fine line between people who want to be part of,643.576,2.602
"something that they never had an official role in,",646.178,2.203
and people who actually played a role in either,648.381,1.935
the campaign or the transition.,650.316,1.368
Julie.,651.684,0.667
"The Press: Sean, I just had two quick questions",652.351,1.335
on the hearing today.,653.686,0.667
Does the President -- now that we know there is an,654.353,2.102
ongoing investigation by the FBI -- does the,656.455,2.403
President stand by his comments that he is not,658.858,2.669
aware of any contacts that his campaign associates,661.527,2.402
had with Russia during the election?,663.929,1.769
Mr. Spicer: Yes.,665.698,0.901
The Press: And then the second one is: Has anyone,666.599,2.936
"from the White House -- Mr. Spicer: Well, can I",669.535,1.735
just amend the first one?,671.27,0.968
The Press: Sure.,672.238,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Obviously, just to be clear, I know",672.905,1.435
that -- I&amp;#39;m trying to think through this for a,674.34,1.401
"second, because obviously General Flynn -- but again --",675.741,1.902
"The Press: Right, particularly during the",677.643,1.335
"campaign, before the election.",678.978,0.867
Mr. Spicer: Right.,679.845,1.101
And I&amp;#39;m not aware of any at this time.,680.946,2.036
But even General Flynn was a volunteer of the,682.982,2.636
"campaign, and then obviously there&amp;#39;s been",685.618,2.502
discussion of Paul Manafort who played a very,688.12,2.736
limited role for a very limited amount of time.,690.856,2.403
But beyond --,693.259,1.434
The Press: He was the chairman of the campaign --,694.693,1.969
"Mr. Spicer: Hey, Jonathan, hold on.",696.662,1.335
Can you stop interrupting other people&amp;#39;s questions?,697.997,1.334
The Press: (Inaudible) played a limited role --,699.331,1.736
"Mr. Spicer: Hey, Jonathan, somebody is asking",701.067,2.469
a question.,703.536,0.8
It&amp;#39;s not your press briefing.,704.336,2.703
Julie is asking a question.,707.039,2.102
Please calm down.,709.141,0.668
Julie.,709.809,0.667
The Press: Are you saying then that the President is,710.476,1.368
aware of contacts that Manafort had,711.844,1.335
during the campaign?,713.179,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, nothing that hasn&amp;#39;t been",713.846,1.335
previously discussed.,715.181,0.667
I just don&amp;#39;t want to make it look like we&amp;#39;re not,715.848,1.335
aware of the stuff that&amp;#39;s --,717.183,0.667
The Press: Understood.,717.85,0.667
"And then the second thing is, anyone from the White",718.517,1.368
"House, up to the President, been",719.885,1.335
interviewed by the FBI as part of,721.22,1.335
this investigation?,722.555,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Not that I&amp;#39;m aware of.,723.222,1.335
Mara.,724.557,0.667
The Press: You said that -- you made a point of,725.224,1.335
saying that Comey refused to say whether he had,726.559,1.334
briefed Obama about the investigation.,727.893,1.368
"And also, the President, on his official account,",729.261,2.636
tweeted the same thing today.,731.897,1.835
"Comey made a point today of saying, please do not",733.732,3.671
draw any conclusions from my ability to confirm or,737.403,3.303
"deny anything, but you are",740.706,1.835
drawing a conclusion from that.,742.541,1.835
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think we&amp;#39;re pointing it out.",744.376,3.404
"I mean, we&amp;#39;re making a point that",747.78,1.335
it is not known.,749.115,1.134
"And I think there&amp;#39;s further -- I mean, to",750.249,2.736
"everyone who was looking for a conclusion today, I",752.985,2.769
think there&amp;#39;s a lot more that needs to be discussed,755.754,3.07
and looked at before we can jump to a conclusion about,758.824,3.07
The Press: (Inaudible.),761.894,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Hold on.,762.561,0.668
"But I think the point is, is that, in the same token",763.229,2.469
"you&amp;#39;ve got individuals that want an answer, and",765.698,3.47
"at the same time, there&amp;#39;s clearly a lot of",769.168,1.768
information that still hasn&amp;#39;t come out or,770.936,1.368
been discussed.,772.304,0.668
The Press: So you&amp;#39;re looking forward to,772.972,1.601
this investigation --,774.573,0.734
Mr. Spicer: I think that we are --,775.307,1.635
there is a lot more to come is the answer that I --,776.942,2.503
The Press: But the reason that I&amp;#39;m asking,779.445,1.334
this question is you said that they are going to,780.779,1.335
come to the same conclusion of,782.114,1.301
everybody else.,783.415,0.935
"Mr. Spicer: My point is, is that -- The Press: So",784.35,1.535
you already know what the conclusion is?,785.885,1.334
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, no.",787.219,0.668
What I&amp;#39;m getting at is that there is this,787.887,1.434
continuous -- there is this media narrative that,789.321,2.803
"continues to talk about collusion that exists, and",792.124,2.202
yet every person that&amp;#39;s been briefed -- Nunes; Tom,794.326,3.537
"Cotton; Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware;",797.863,3.537
"Clapper, the Obama appointee -- have all said",801.4,2.803
that nothing that they&amp;#39;ve seen makes them believe,804.203,2.669
that there was any collusion.,806.872,1.135
And I think there&amp;#39;s a difference between talking,808.007,1.968
"about an investigation into the 2016 election,",809.975,2.836
"which we all know, and any evidence of collusion.",812.811,3.804
"There is no evidence, according to the people",816.615,2.202
"that have been briefed, of any collusion or activity",818.817,2.803
that leads them to believe that that exists.,821.62,3.137
I think that is an important point that gets,824.757,1.601
overlooked over and over and over again.,826.358,1.502
"The Press: Right, but you said it&amp;#39;s fine to look",827.86,1.335
"into it, but they are going to come to the same",829.195,1.434
conclusion of everybody else -- that this,830.629,2.069
collusion doesn&amp;#39;t exist.,832.698,0.734
So you already know --,833.432,1.235
"Mr. Spicer: No, I don&amp;#39;t. What I&amp;#39;m --",834.667,1.835
The Press: - investigation is finished --,836.502,1.334
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, that&amp;#39;s not what I&amp;#39;m saying.",837.836,1.335
"What I&amp;#39;m saying is, is that every single person",839.171,2.436
-- because what the director said today is,841.607,2.135
that there&amp;#39;s an ongoing investigation.,843.742,2.069
My point is to say that everybody who&amp;#39;s been,845.811,2.403
briefed on that investigation -- it,848.214,2.202
doesn&amp;#39;t -- there is an assumption that because,850.416,1.568
"there is an investigation, it must mean that",851.984,1.969
it&amp;#39;s about something.,853.953,1.801
My point to you is that there is an assumption on,855.754,2.036
behalf of most people in the media about what that,857.79,2.469
investigation must mean.,860.259,1.268
"And my point to you is, is that, despite the",861.527,2.636
narrative that gets played over and over again with,864.163,2.702
respect to what the investigation might mean,866.865,3.204
"in terms of collusion, every person, Republican",870.069,2.302
"and Democrat, that has been briefed on it has",872.371,2.202
come to the same conclusion that there is,874.573,2.102
no collusion and that that&amp;#39;s over.,876.675,1.802
"So while we can talk about an investigation,",878.477,2.836
"big-picture holistically, the idea that so many",881.313,2.836
people are trying to jump to a conclusion seems,884.149,2.703
"very, very misguided.",886.852,1.101
Zeke.,887.953,0.668
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",888.621,0.9
Two quick ones.,889.521,0.968
"First -- briefing with the President, do you expect",890.489,2.836
the invitation to President Xi to that,893.325,2.202
summit that&amp;#39;s being reported on for next month,895.527,2.503
to be -- was that extended on that trip?,898.03,2.836
And do you expect that to be taking place early,900.866,2.603
"April, the 6th, 7th and 8th?",903.469,1.568
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;ll try to have more of a,905.037,1.435
readout afterwards.,906.472,0.734
I know that they&amp;#39;re going to talk extensively about,907.206,2.369
"what he accomplished in both Japan, South Korea,",909.575,2.235
and obviously in Beijing.,911.81,1.135
But I&amp;#39;m going to let the Secretary of State debrief,912.945,2.536
the President before I get ahead of deciding what was,915.481,6.506
discussed in Beijing.,921.987,0.868
The Press: And back to the previous topic.,922.855,1.535
I was hoping you could,924.39,0.667
square the circle a little bit.,925.057,1.001
"You said in the case of the President&amp;#39;s tweets, on",926.058,2.936
"this an ongoing investigation, that more",928.994,1.769
things will come out that may justify that.,930.763,2.369
"But in the case of the Clinton charges, you",933.132,2.636
listed all the people who have said (inaudible),935.768,2.369
investigation there.,938.137,0.7
"Why, in one case, is that sufficient to say that",938.837,1.735
"there is no -- you could rule out collusion now,",940.572,1.635
"versus in the other case you&amp;#39;d say, oh, there is",942.207,1.635
going to be more information coming out,943.842,1.335
that will prove these tweets?,945.177,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I&amp;#39;m not -- because again, I think",945.844,2.503
there&amp;#39;s a difference.,948.347,0.667
I&amp;#39;m not ruling anything out.,949.014,1.235
I&amp;#39;m merely explaining to you that every person --,950.249,3.503
"Republican, Democrat, Obama, that served in the",953.752,2.469
Obama administration across a broad section --,956.221,2.002
The Press: You can say the same thing about tweets.,958.223,1.902
Mr. Spicer: In terms of what?,960.125,1.335
The Press: Wiretappings.,961.46,1.468
Mr. Spicer: But I think that there is -- on the,962.928,4.738
"investigation itself, we know from the people",967.666,2.77
who have been briefed.,970.436,1.167
"On the other piece of it, we know that there is --",971.603,1.769
"it&amp;#39;s an ongoing thing, and that even according to the",973.372,2.336
Department of Justice in terms of the information,975.708,2.869
"that has been provided and Chairman Nunes, that they",978.577,2.402
are still at the beginning of this process.,980.979,1.736
That is a very different thing than a group of,982.715,2.202
people saying there is an ongoing investigation.,984.917,2.335
"And from what we&amp;#39;ve been briefed, there is no",987.252,1.769
evidence to suggest any type of collusion.,989.021,3.003
That&amp;#39;s the difference.,992.024,0.667
Hunter.,992.691,0.668
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",993.359,0.667
On a slightly different topic: In his first eight,994.026,2.736
"weeks in office, President Trump has made at least 10",996.762,2.97
trips to the golf course.,999.732,1.534
He regularly used to criticize President Obama,1001.266,2.336
for spending time on the course.,1003.602,1.468
How is his golf game any different?,1005.07,1.535
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think two things.",1006.605,1.401
"One is, you saw him utilize this as an",1008.006,2.503
opportunity with Prime Minister Abe to help,1010.509,5.405
foster deeper relationships in Southeast,1015.914,2.837
"Asia -- in Asia, rather -- and have a growing",1018.751,3.403
relationship that&amp;#39;s going to help,1022.154,1.702
U.S. interests.,1023.856,0.7
How you use the game of golf is something that he,1024.556,2.369
has talked about.,1026.925,0.801
"Secondly, we went down to -- he had a mini Cabinet",1027.726,3.971
"meeting the other day down -- or two weekends ago,",1031.697,3.904
down at his club in Virginia.,1035.601,2.369
And I remember so many people jumping to the,1037.97,2.035
conclusion that he&amp;#39;s going down and playing golf.,1040.005,2.302
Just because you go somewhere doesn&amp;#39;t,1042.307,1.335
necessarily mean that you did that.,1043.642,1.401
"So on a couple of occasions, he&amp;#39;s actually",1045.043,1.435
"conducted meetings there, he&amp;#39;s actually",1046.478,1.969
had phone calls.,1048.447,1.601
So just because he heads there doesn&amp;#39;t mean that,1050.048,2.069
that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happening.,1052.117,0.934
The Press: I know he did meet with Prime Minister,1053.051,2.136
"Abe on the course, but we&amp;#39;re not getting a lot of",1055.187,2.502
details on other high-level meetings that,1057.689,1.769
are taking place.,1059.458,0.801
If he is having these productive meetings on the,1060.259,2.169
"course, why isn&amp;#39;t the President and his aides",1062.428,2.502
being a little more forthcoming about,1064.93,1.468
what he&amp;#39;s doing?,1066.398,0.667
Mr. Spicer: It&amp;#39;s the same reason that he can have,1067.065,2.002
dinner or lunch with somebody and not --,1069.067,1.335
because I think the President is entitled to a,1070.402,1.335
"bit of privacy at some point, which is what",1071.737,1.368
we&amp;#39;ve always agreed to.,1073.105,0.667
"We bring the protective pool to be there, but the",1073.772,1.669
President is also entitled,1075.441,2.402
to a bit of privacy as well.,1077.843,3.637
Trey.,1081.48,0.667
The Press: Does the President believe the FBI,1082.147,3.103
will do a fair job of investigating any sort of,1085.25,2.97
links to Russia during the election?,1088.22,1.535
And then I have one more for you.,1089.755,1.334
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think there&amp;#39;s a variety of",1091.089,1.502
institutions looking at it -- both the House and the,1092.591,2.069
"Senate Intelligence Committee, the FBI.",1094.66,3.737
"But, yeah, I think that when you get to the bottom",1098.397,1.968
"of it, we&amp;#39;ll have a much better picture of what&amp;#39;s",1100.365,2.736
"happening, and I think it will continue to",1103.101,1.335
vindicate him on that.,1104.436,1.368
Go ahead.,1105.804,0.668
"The Press: In a follow-up, the President tweeted this",1106.472,1.801
morning a question about a potential DNC connection,1108.273,3.07
to Russia during the election.,1111.343,1.702
Is he under the impression that the Clinton campaign,1113.045,2.302
had inappropriate contact with Russia,1115.347,2.102
during the election?,1117.449,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think that -- and that&amp;#39;s an",1118.116,2.67
interesting aspect of all of this that&amp;#39;s,1120.786,1.635
not being covered.,1122.421,0.667
"Number one, from everything that&amp;#39;s been",1123.088,2.536
"publicly available, on several occasions the DNC",1125.624,3.27
was asked by the FBI to investigate -- or to allow,1128.894,2.836
"their servers to be looked at, despite all of the",1131.73,2.736
claims of their concerns about leaking.,1134.466,2.136
"And yet, the question still doesn&amp;#39;t come out --",1136.602,2.369
"why wouldn&amp;#39;t the DNC, on multiple occasions,",1138.971,3.103
rebuff the FBI?,1142.074,1.134
Why were they not wanting -- if they were so,1143.208,3.57
"concerned about hacks and leaking, why did the DNC",1146.778,3.471
not ask the FBI to come look?,1150.249,3.036
Not only did they not ask them; they rebuffed them,1153.285,2.002
on multiple occasions.,1155.287,1.301
Why?,1156.588,0.668
What are they hiding?,1157.256,1.368
What were they concerned of?,1158.624,1.968
But I think there is a serious question.,1160.592,1.669
"I mean, it&amp;#39;s not -- they&amp;#39;re very clear about",1162.261,3.069
"the concerns they have, as well as all of the",1165.33,3.47
leadership in the Democratic Party.,1168.8,1.535
And yet when it came to hacks and leaks out of the,1170.335,3.27
DNC -- and they&amp;#39;re quick to jump to the conclusion,1173.605,3.337
"about who did it, and yet they wouldn&amp;#39;t allow the",1176.942,2.269
FBI to investigate it -- there&amp;#39;s a whole second set,1179.211,2.803
of concerns here in terms of what was,1182.014,2.068
Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s role.,1184.082,0.968
"I mean, if you look at the Obama administration and",1185.05,2.536
the Clintons&amp;#39; involvement with Russia in terms of,1187.586,2.869
donations the Clintons received from Russia and,1190.455,2.036
"entities, the idea that they sold off a tremendous",1192.491,6.773
"amount of the uranium to the Russian government,",1199.264,3.537
and yet where was the concern for that?,1202.801,2.503
What are we doing to look into that?,1205.304,1.534
It was the Obama administration in 2009,1206.838,2.036
that talked about a reset with Russia and a desire,1208.874,3.136
to reset relationships.,1212.01,2.436
It was Hillary Clinton who signed off on the deal,1214.446,1.768
that gave a Russian company one-fifth,1216.214,2.536
of the U.S. uranium supply.,1218.75,1.368
Where is the questioning about that?,1220.118,2.036
What did they get?,1222.154,0.901
There was discussion the other day about a Russian,1223.055,2.469
official noting that both campaigns they sought to,1225.524,2.636
-- where is the concern about their efforts on the,1228.16,2.436
Hillary Clinton thing?,1230.596,1.101
"The Democrats and the Democratic Party, and a",1231.697,2.135
lot of those individuals are quick to point,1233.832,2.002
"fingers, and yet when it comes to discussing their",1235.834,2.302
own collusion or questions involving their,1238.136,4.505
involvement with Russian officials or buy-offs to,1242.641,3.136
"the Russians, there&amp;#39;s no discussion there.",1245.777,2.036
"So you got to wonder, on both sides, where&amp;#39;s the",1247.813,3.136
parity when it comes to these kinds,1250.949,1.969
of investigations?,1252.918,0.667
Margaret.,1253.585,0.667
"The Press: Sean, what constitutes conclusive",1254.252,1.369
evidence for the President on this front when you say,1255.621,2.702
there&amp;#39;s more to come forward?,1258.323,1.402
You&amp;#39;ve got the FBI director saying nothing to,1259.725,2.269
"back up the President&amp;#39;s tweets about wiretapping,",1261.994,2.002
"the former head of the DNI,",1263.996,1.701
House Intelligence Committees.,1265.697,0.834
"I mean, you&amp;#39;ve had a series of officials.",1266.531,2.47
So when does this end for the President?,1269.001,1.735
Is it March 28th?,1270.736,1.001
"Mr. Spicer: It&amp;#39;s not a question of a date, it&amp;#39;s a",1271.737,1.835
question of where we get answers.,1273.572,1.334
If you look at someone like Michael Flynn and you,1274.906,2.136
"ask the question, how does an American citizen, who",1277.042,2.769
should be protected by law from having their identity,1279.811,2.736
"unmasked, how does that happen?",1282.547,2.937
Because you got to think about it just like this:,1285.484,1.935
The FBI and all the relevant intelligence,1287.419,2.169
agencies have access to this document; they can,1289.588,1.935
figure out who it was.,1291.523,1.001
Right? So --,1292.524,1.768
The Press: I&amp;#39;m sorry -- who it was?,1294.292,1.369
"Mr. Spicer: Hold on. In other words, they --",1295.661,1.534
The Press: The wiretapping,1297.195,0.668
"of the President, that&amp;#39;s the claim.",1297.863,1.334
Mr. Spicer: Listen. I understand that.,1299.197,1.335
What I&amp;#39;m getting at is that there&amp;#39;s a lot of,1300.532,1.335
information that we have come to learn about what,1301.867,1.735
happened in terms of surveillance throughout,1303.602,2.302
the 2016 election and the transition.,1305.904,2.703
And when you look at somebody like Michael,1308.607,1.501
Flynn and you realize that while they might have been,1310.108,2.403
"looking at somebody else at that time, how does",1312.511,2.269
somebody&amp;#39;s name that&amp;#39;s protected by law from,1314.78,2.202
being disclosed get put out in the public?,1316.982,5.072
Why was it put out in the public?,1322.054,1.334
Because the people in the intelligence community,1323.388,1.335
would have had access to that information.,1324.723,1.401
They could have found out who it was.,1326.124,1.969
But yet you&amp;#39;ve got to question why was a name,1328.093,2.803
that should have been protected by law from,1330.896,1.868
being put out into the public domain,1332.764,1.669
put out there?,1334.433,0.9
What were the motives behind that?,1335.333,1.335
What else do we need to know?,1336.668,1.602
Who was behind that kind of unmasking?,1338.27,2.636
The Press: So are you saying the President has,1340.906,1.601
evidence that we have yet to see in public?,1342.507,2.87
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, I am saying that there&amp;#39;s a lot",1345.377,1.335
more questions that need to get asked about what,1346.712,2.736
"was being done in terms of surveillance, who was",1349.448,2.936
"being surveilled, why were they being involved, what",1352.384,2.202
techniques -- why are certain people being sort,1354.586,3.537
"of &amp;quot;unmasked&amp;quot; and having their identity known,",1358.123,3.437
what was going on.,1361.56,0.867
But there&amp;#39;s a lot more questions than answers,1362.427,1.835
that need to get asked.,1364.262,1.035
The Press: Who does the President trust to provide,1365.297,1.835
those answers if not the heads of all,1367.132,2.836
those agencies?,1369.968,0.667
Mr. Spicer: And we&amp;#39;ve talked about this ad,1370.635,2.002
"nauseam, that the House and the Senate",1372.637,1.635
Intelligence Committees are looking into this.,1374.272,1.602
Today is the first of several hearings that,1375.874,3.47
Chairman Nunes intends to call.,1379.344,1.635
Senator Burr has already talked about it.,1380.979,1.835
There&amp;#39;s a ways to go.,1382.814,0.834
And I get that you guys want to know the end of,1383.648,1.602
"the book right now, but we&amp;#39;re on the first",1385.25,1.535
chapter of this process.,1386.785,1.501
Steve.,1388.286,0.668
"The Press: So Burr and Nunes, he does trust",1388.954,1.334
them to provide --,1390.288,0.734
Mr. Spicer: Of course.,1391.022,0.668
We&amp;#39;ve put out a statement saying so much that we,1391.69,1.601
asked them to look into it.,1393.291,1.302
So I don&amp;#39;t think it should come to any surprise that,1394.593,2.302
that&amp;#39;s where we have noted multiple times that that&amp;#39;s,1396.895,3.237
where the President believe the appropriate,1400.132,1.501
place and the process for all of these,1401.633,3.27
documents to go through.,1404.903,0.801
Steve.,1405.704,0.667
The Press: The President said he had a lot of,1406.371,1.335
meetings over the weekend on North Korea.,1407.706,2.069
Who were those meetings with?,1409.775,1.668
And what was his reaction to North Korea&amp;#39;s test of,1411.443,2.235
this new rocket engine?,1413.678,3.037
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think we continue to be",1416.715,3.036
concerned with North Korea&amp;#39;s activity.,1419.751,1.735
That&amp;#39;s why not only have we continued to have,1421.486,3.07
conversations with officials in Japan and,1424.556,2.369
"South Korea, but we continue to urge China to",1426.925,2.636
step in and play a larger role in deterring both the,1429.561,5.639
ballistic and other missile threats that,1435.2,4.237
North Korea plays.,1439.437,0.768
I will try to have a further readout on some of,1440.205,3.203
"those conversations, but I think there is growing",1443.408,1.668
concern about North Korea.,1445.076,2.536
I think that is part of what Secretary Tillerson,1447.612,2.469
is going to be discussing,1450.081,0.868
to him during their meeting.,1450.949,0.901
The Press: And did Tillerson get a promise,1451.85,2.769
from China to weigh in more on North Korea?,1454.619,2.102
Mr. Spicer: I think he sent a very clear signal,1456.721,2.87
that our policy of strategic,1459.591,1.368
patience is over.,1460.959,1.735
The President and the Secretary of State have an,1462.694,3.337
expectation that China employed multiple points,1466.031,3.703
of pressure on North Korea.,1469.734,1.268
We know that we don&amp;#39;t agree 100 percent of the,1471.002,3.003
"time with China, but as the State Department noted",1474.005,2.169
"yesterday, both President Xi and Secretary Tillerson",1476.174,2.269
agreed that there are opportunities for greater,1478.443,3.103
"cooperation between China and the United States, and",1481.546,2.603
acknowledged that there are and will be in the,1484.149,1.935
future differences between the two countries.,1486.084,2.102
But I think that Secretary Tillerson&amp;#39;s trip continued,1488.186,3.237
to -- or helped set us down that path.,1491.423,2.202
And I think that the follow-on meetings that,1493.625,2.236
the leaders intend to have will be helpful,1495.861,3.069
in that vein.,1498.93,1.468
The Press: Given the talk last week about the,1500.398,4.071
"budget, the priorities for the American tax dollars,",1504.469,5.205
the need to cut programs like -- or make cuts to,1509.674,1.869
"programs like Meals on Wheels, is the President",1511.543,2.069
going to consider curbing some of his trips to,1513.612,2.168
Mar-a-Lago that the GAO estimates could cost $3,1515.78,3.237
million for the President to Palm Beach?,1519.017,2.169
Is he planning to cut those back at all given,1521.186,3.203
his feelings about the priorities for the,1524.389,2.102
Americans&amp;#39; tax dollars?,1526.491,0.834
Mr. Spicer: I think that is a vast reach to suggest,1527.325,3.871
"-- I mean, Presidents always travel.",1531.196,1.334
"And I think the President, wherever he goes, he",1532.53,1.335
carries the apparatus of the White House with us.,1533.865,1.335
That is just something that happens.,1535.2,1.334
The President will continue to go and travel,1536.534,5.005
around the country and have meetings to solve,1544.809,2.837
the nation&amp;#39;s problems.,1547.646,0.667
"And again, I think just -- because I know you took a",1548.313,3.203
"little bit of a shot there, I think even The",1551.516,1.335
"Washington Post, which is no friend to",1552.851,1.802
"conservatives, even they sided with us that these",1554.653,4.638
false sort of narratives on Meals on Wheels -- it&amp;#39;s,1559.291,2.969
not a federal program.,1562.26,1.001
Three percent of their total budget comes from a,1563.261,3.57
block grant that&amp;#39;s passed through there.,1566.831,1.502
It&amp;#39;s a state-run program.,1568.333,1.635
They had apparently a,1569.968,1.168
phenomenal weekend this week.,1571.136,1.468
"I get that that&amp;#39;s a cute program to point at, but",1572.604,2.636
it&amp;#39;s false and misleading to try to make,1575.24,2.335
that narrative stick.,1577.575,1.635
The Press: So to your point that all Presidents,1579.21,2.57
"travel, no President has traveled so often and so",1581.78,3.069
early to their own private residence.,1584.849,1.335
Mr. Spicer: President Bush went to Crawford.,1586.184,1.335
The Press: Not this often and --,1587.519,1.334
"Mr. Spicer: I get it, I get it.",1588.853,0.701
"But at the same time, the President is -- very",1589.554,5.839
clearly that he&amp;#39;s worked seven days a week.,1595.393,1.835
This is where he goes to see his family.,1597.228,2.803
He brings people down there.,1600.031,1.001
This is part of being President.,1601.032,1.568
John.,1602.6,0.668
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",1603.268,2.035
Turning back to the meeting with Chancellor,1605.303,2.87
"Merkel on Friday, did the President and the",1608.173,3.503
Chancellor discuss the economic crisis,1611.676,2.202
in Greece at all?,1613.878,1.769
And given the appointment of two officials to the,1615.647,3.97
Treasury Department who have been critical of the,1619.617,3.537
"International Monetary Fund, does the",1623.154,2.203
administration see a new or different role for the,1625.357,3.136
IMF in resolving the Greek economic crisis?,1628.493,2.736
Mr. Spicer: Let me refer you to the Treasury,1631.229,1.702
Department on IMF.,1632.931,1.368
I think the readout that we provided on the,1634.299,2.836
"Secretary&amp;#39;s -- on the Chancellor&amp;#39;s visit, rather",1637.135,2.302
-- excuse me -- speaks for itself.,1639.437,2.369
They spoke at length as far as what they discussed,1641.806,2.97
and what they meant.,1644.776,0.767
So I&amp;#39;m not going to step on that.,1645.543,1.502
Francesca.,1647.045,0.667
The Press: Thank you.,1647.712,1.268
Are you aware of any White House officials that are,1648.98,2.603
under investigation by the FBI?,1651.583,1.668
Mr. Spicer: No.,1653.251,0.768
The Press: Okay.,1654.019,0.734
And you mentioned the &amp;quot;hangers-on&amp;quot; in the,1654.753,2.168
"campaign earlier and Carter Page, but there was",1656.921,2.203
also a question about Roger Stone.,1659.124,1.668
Was he also in that category?,1660.792,1.635
Is he someone that the President is still in,1662.427,2.469
frequent contact with?,1664.896,0.834
Because he&amp;#39;s often called an informal advisor to the,1665.73,2.936
President and a confidante of his.,1668.666,1.836
Mr. Spicer: Mr. Stone is somebody the President has,1670.502,2.202
known for a long time.,1672.704,2.803
He worked briefly on the campaign I think until,1675.507,1.968
"about August of 2015, from recollection.",1677.475,4.071
They have talked from time to time but I don&amp;#39;t think,1681.546,4.671
any time recently.,1686.217,1.335
But they had a long relationship going back,1687.552,2.202
years where he would provide counsel.,1689.754,1.835
"And again, he played a role early on in his",1691.589,2.57
campaign but ended that role in August of 2015.,1694.159,3.069
And I don&amp;#39;t know at all when the last time they,1697.228,2.236
even spoke was.,1699.464,0.667
"The Press: Sean, in the meeting this morning with",1700.131,5.706
"Gates, did the President&amp;#39;s cut in NIH",1705.837,4.037
funding come up?,1709.874,0.801
And how does he square meeting with Gates and,1710.675,2.803
sort of focusing on this whole need to continue,1713.478,3.203
medical research and then at the same time want to,1716.681,3.137
cut medical research funding by,1719.818,1.234
such a large amount?,1721.052,0.968
Mr. Spicer: I know they talked about cures and,1722.02,2.602
"health, and I think he applauds a lot of the work",1724.622,2.937
that they&amp;#39;ve done overseas in particular.,1727.559,3.403
"I don&amp;#39;t have a full readout on it yet, but",1730.962,2.069
I&amp;#39;ll try to get you more on it.,1733.031,1.034
"Look, we&amp;#39;ve discussed the NIH in particular.",1734.065,1.335
I think that there&amp;#39;s this assumption in Washington,1735.4,1.334
that if you don&amp;#39;t spend more on a subject that,1736.734,5.339
you&amp;#39;re not caring as much.,1742.073,1.835
When you look at some of the agencies and,1743.908,1.936
"departments and programs that we&amp;#39;ve seen, in many",1745.844,3.97
cases they&amp;#39;re not meeting their mission.,1749.814,1.735
And I think there are cost-savings that can be,1751.549,1.602
achieved so that you can focus the dollars that are,1753.151,2.636
being allocated towards a more effective use of the,1755.787,3.77
mission at hand.,1759.557,2.069
"But it&amp;#39;s interesting, only in Washington do you",1761.626,2.736
literally judge the success of something by,1764.362,2.236
"how much money you throw at the problem, not",1766.598,1.835
actually whether it&amp;#39;s solving the problem or,1768.433,1.601
coming up with anything.,1770.034,1.769
April.,1771.803,0.667
"The Press: Sean, I want to go to a couple of topics.",1772.47,5.072
"One, back on wiretapping, Comey said he had no",1777.542,4.037
information supporting that President Obama,1781.579,2.236
wiretapped President Trump.,1783.815,1.335
"So with that, you have Schiff saying things like",1785.15,3.87
there are half-truths coming from this,1789.02,1.335
"President; no truth, it&amp;#39;s dangerous; we&amp;#39;re",1790.355,2.502
alienating our allies; we need to be able to,1792.857,3.437
trust our President.,1796.294,0.734
"And with that, I&amp;#39;m going to ask you -- and I need",1797.028,3.003
"an answer for this -- how do you regain trust, as",1800.031,2.736
some view him as the boy who cried wolf?,1802.767,2.236
Mr. Spicer: I think if you&amp;#39;re citing Adam,1805.003,1.968
Schiff&amp;#39;s political diatribe at the beginning,1806.971,1.969
as some sort of sense of -- he literally went off --,1808.94,2.869
The Press: But you have Comey saying --,1811.809,1.335
Mr. Spicer: Hold on.,1813.144,0.667
If you want to talk about a series of mistruths and,1813.811,1.902
"misdirection, I think if you look at that opening",1815.713,2.603
statement it was filled with those.,1818.316,1.735
So I don&amp;#39;t need to use that as some basis for,1820.051,2.903
having to respond to you.,1822.954,1.635
I was watching a lot of the reporter response on,1824.589,2.402
"Twitter initially to his sort of diatribe, and I",1826.991,4.772
think there were several folks that talked about,1831.763,1.902
how he&amp;#39;s mischaracterizing and taking things,1833.665,2.903
way out of context.,1836.568,0.8
So to use that as the basis of some,1837.368,1.836
kind of authoritative --,1839.204,1.401
The Press: What about Comey saying there is no information?,1840.605,3.537
How do you regain the trust at that --,1844.142,3.17
"Mr. Spicer: April, I&amp;#39;ve addressed this",1847.312,2.135
multiple times.,1849.447,0.701
"At this point, we are at the beginning phases of",1850.148,2.436
this and we have a ways to go.,1852.584,1.434
John.,1854.018,0.668
"The Press: Wait, I&amp;#39;m not finished.",1854.686,1.668
I asked on the budget.,1856.354,1.335
On the budget.,1857.689,0.767
How -- and this is kind of going back to --,1858.456,2.903
Mr. Spicer: This is number three now.,1861.359,1.869
The Press: Not really; it&amp;#39;s number two.,1863.228,1.835
Thank you.,1865.063,0.667
How is the President contributing to his own,1865.73,1.969
"role of reducing spending, the deficit and the debt,",1867.699,2.369
and his management of spending here at,1870.068,1.835
the White House?,1871.903,0.801
Mr. Spicer: There&amp;#39;s a lot -- we&amp;#39;ve used -- the White,1872.704,2.869
"House, when it looks at a total percentage of the",1875.573,2.903
"budget, is miniscule.",1878.476,0.868
I think that to ask that question is somewhat,1879.344,2.168
ironic after seeing Director Mulvaney sit up,1881.512,2.503
here the other day and talk about the savings and,1884.015,3.737
the cost-cutting measures that we&amp;#39;ve seen,1887.752,1.502
across the entire budget.,1889.254,2.702
He sat up here and got grilled on that and,1891.956,2.369
answered effectively how the President is looking,1894.325,2.77
at efficiencies and duplicity in all programs,1897.095,2.435
throughout government.,1899.53,1.068
So it&amp;#39;s not just a question of here at the,1900.598,2.569
"White House, but he&amp;#39;s looking at it holistically",1903.167,1.969
throughout all of government.,1905.136,1.168
But then you look at some of the activities the,1906.304,1.368
President is personally engaged in terms of the,1907.672,2.235
"F-35, the next generation of Air Force One,",1909.907,4.705
personally getting -- and looking at ways in which,1914.612,2.87
we can create a more effective and efficient,1917.482,2.402
procurement process.,1919.884,0.901
That&amp;#39;s one area where I think you&amp;#39;re going to see,1920.785,1.735
"the President personally engage on more and more,",1922.52,2.269
is looking at all the stuff that the government,1924.789,2.035
"buys and how we&amp;#39;re doing it, our bidding process in",1926.824,2.67
"so many ways, especially",1929.494,1.601
in the Department of Defense.,1931.095,1.202
The Press: What about salaries?,1932.297,0.967
We know three people here are not taking salaries.,1933.264,1.935
But what about salaries?,1935.199,0.901
I&amp;#39;m talking about since he&amp;#39;s making these massive,1936.1,1.835
"cuts, is the hurt going to come here as well?",1937.935,2.303
Mr. Spicer: Sure.,1940.238,0.867
"It&amp;#39;s not just a hurt, but you bring it up -- there",1941.105,2.069
are multiple people here who are,1943.174,1.668
"not taking salaries. I mean, that is --",1944.842,1.569
"The Press: Three,",1946.411,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Huh?,1947.078,0.667
The Press: Three.,1947.745,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: No, way more than three, April.",1948.413,1.635
The Press: How many?,1950.048,1.301
"Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;ll get back to you, but there are",1951.349,2.936
several individuals that are not taking,1954.285,1.335
a salary here.,1955.62,0.701
So when you talk about commitment to helping to,1956.321,1.334
"come serve this government, serve the",1957.655,1.335
"President and actually help institute a vision,",1958.99,2.102
there&amp;#39;s a lot of people who have sacrificed,1961.092,2.436
"tremendously in terms of saying, I&amp;#39;ll give up --",1963.528,2.536
"I&amp;#39;ve done very well for myself, this country has",1966.064,2.836
"benefitted me, this is an opportunity for me to give",1968.9,1.968
back -- that there are people well through this,1970.868,2.937
organization who have done that.,1973.805,1.735
John.,1975.54,0.667
"The Press: The President met with Dr. Emanuel, as",1976.207,2.202
"you pointed out, a short time ago.",1978.409,2.002
He&amp;#39;s probably one of the fiercest critics of what,1980.411,2.569
the President is trying to do of anybody out there.,1982.98,2.87
He&amp;#39;s made it quite clear that he believes that this,1985.85,2.603
will take us back to worse than we were before the,1988.453,2.903
Affordable Care Act came in.,1991.356,1.368
What did the President hope to gain by meeting,1992.724,2.302
with Dr. Emanuel today?,1995.026,1.034
"Mr. Spicer: Well, he&amp;#39;s an architect of Obamacare.",1996.06,2.269
I think that despite our political and policy,1998.329,3.737
"differences, he wants to hear ideas not just of him",2002.066,3.804
but a lot of people.,2005.87,0.667
We&amp;#39;ve brought in people on both sides of the aisle,2006.537,3.137
"from both houses, from industry.",2009.674,2.669
The idea is to try to make this the best possible --,2012.343,3.404
he talked to Elijah Cummings a couple weeks,2015.747,2.002
ago about drug prices.,2017.749,1.001
"It&amp;#39;s not about ideology or party, it&amp;#39;s about",2018.75,3.303
instituting a patient-centric drug and,2022.053,4.938
healthcare system that benefits the American,2026.991,2.636
people and gives them the access and the price point,2029.627,2.87
that they can get healthcare and,2032.497,1.835
actually get coverage.,2034.332,1.168
So it is hearing his ideas.,2035.5,2.636
It&amp;#39;s listening to his suggestions and figuring,2038.136,2.235
out if we can make it better.,2040.371,1.168
Part of the manager&amp;#39;s amendment that Speaker,2041.539,2.336
Ryan talked about is in large part because we&amp;#39;ve,2043.875,3.703
been listening and making it better and,2047.578,2.136
making it better.,2049.714,0.667
And as it continues to work its will through the,2050.381,1.735
"process, it&amp;#39;s not just the current bill but it&amp;#39;s also",2052.116,3.07
the additional legislation that&amp;#39;s part of this,2055.186,2.002
overall three-pronged process that,2057.188,1.501
we&amp;#39;ve talked about.,2058.689,0.935
So making sure that we do this right and we give the,2059.624,2.769
American people the best possible outcome is what,2062.393,1.902
this has always been about.,2064.295,1.268
The Press: The Speaker wants to get this in front,2065.563,2.703
of the House maybe by Thursday.,2068.266,1.768
How much will the plan change between now and,2070.034,1.402
then compared to what we saw voted on in the,2071.436,1.801
first two committees?,2073.237,0.734
Mr. Spicer: Three.,2073.971,1.135
The House Ways and Means Committee --,2075.106,2.669
The Press: And is the President,2077.775,1.702
going up to the Hill tomorrow morning?,2079.477,1.568
Mr. Spicer: We don&amp;#39;t have any announcements on the,2081.045,1.869
schedule at this time.,2082.914,0.967
He&amp;#39;s going to continue to make sure that we do,2083.881,2.603
"everything we can, and I&amp;#39;ll leave the legislative",2086.484,2.269
piece up to Speaker Ryan.,2088.753,1.201
The Press: How much does he think is going to,2089.954,1.768
change between what we saw voted on by Ways and Means --,2091.722,3.471
"Mr. Spicer: It depends on how much -- look, I",2095.193,2.636
think Speaker Ryan detailed some additions,2097.829,2.335
and ideas and suggestions on your network yesterday,2100.164,2.67
"with Chris Wallace that he is considering, and I",2102.834,3.003
think as we continue to meet with folks -- there,2105.837,3.336
are some staff-level discussions that occurred,2109.173,2.002
over the weekend.,2111.175,1.001
There will be more later this afternoon.,2112.176,2.369
And to the extent that we can make changes that I,2114.545,2.303
"think enable us to maintain 218 votes,",2116.848,3.837
we will do it.,2120.685,0.667
Sara.,2121.352,0.667
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",2122.019,1.101
There are a number of the President&amp;#39;s supporters on,2123.12,2.002
the Hill and elsewhere who worry that the President&amp;#39;s,2125.122,2.57
refusal to drop the whole wiretapping issue will,2127.692,2.269
eclipse some of his other accomplishments.,2129.961,1.701
What message does the President have for his,2131.662,2.269
supporters who worry that this could be a rabbit,2133.931,2.536
hole that might diminish the other things he&amp;#39;s,2136.467,2.269
"trying to, like healthcare?",2138.736,1.135
Mr. Spicer: I think there will be a lot of,2139.871,2.836
"accomplishments, so they don&amp;#39;t need to worry.",2142.707,2.202
"We&amp;#39;ve got a lot of things coming down the pike, and",2144.909,3.47
"I think whether it&amp;#39;s healthcare, tax reform,",2148.379,3.17
"his infrastructure plan, reforming government,",2151.549,2.269
immigration -- I think we&amp;#39;re going to have a lot,2153.818,1.568
of things to be very proud of that people on both,2155.386,2.469
sides of the aisle are going to be excited,2157.855,2.036
to see enacted.,2159.891,1.334
And so in due time there will be plenty,2161.225,3.437
to be proud of.,2164.662,0.901
Sara.,2165.563,0.667
The Press: You dismiss Paul Manafort as sort of,2166.23,2.036
an incidental figure in this campaign.,2168.266,1.635
"But he worked for the campaign for five months,",2169.901,2.502
"he was the campaign chairman, he was there for",2172.403,2.503
a number of pivotal decisions.,2174.906,1.368
"So I&amp;#39;m wondering how is that insignificant, and is",2176.274,2.435
the White House aware of any contacts between Paul,2178.709,3.204
Manafort and Russian operatives or suspected,2181.913,2.135
Russian operatives?,2184.048,0.901
And is that cause for concern?,2184.949,1.001
"Mr. Spicer: Well, just so we&amp;#39;re clear: I&amp;#39;m not",2185.95,1.602
"dismissing Paul Manafort as a hanger-on, I was",2187.552,2.902
"noting to some other folks,",2190.454,0.901
as Jonathan pointed out.,2191.355,1.602
"With respect to Paul, though, I believe -- and",2192.957,2.069
"again, I&amp;#39;m not looking to re-litigate the election",2195.026,2.903
or -- but I believe Paul was brought on sometime in,2197.929,2.736
"June, and by the middle of August he was no longer",2200.665,3.37
"with the campaign, meaning that for the entire final",2204.035,2.435
"stretch of the general election,",2206.47,1.635
he was not involved.,2208.105,0.901
And so to start to look at some individual that was,2209.006,4.238
"there for a short period of time, or, separately,",2213.244,3.236
individuals who really didn&amp;#39;t play any role in,2216.48,2.002
"the campaign, and to suggest that those are the",2218.482,2.303
basis for anything is a bit ridiculous.,2220.785,2.636
The Press: So are you saying it wouldn&amp;#39;t be,2223.421,2.602
cause for concern if we found out that Paul,2226.023,1.335
Manafort was in contact with Russian operatives or,2227.358,1.335
suspected operatives when he was,2228.693,1.334
the campaign chairman?,2230.027,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, no, I think that -- but to",2230.695,1.368
"intimate that somebody who was there for eight weeks,",2232.063,3.403
and definitely not there in the final three months,2235.466,1.935
of the campaign played some kind of lasting role,2237.401,2.603
"that influenced -- you know, again, you realize,",2240.004,2.703
"I think somewhere between March -- I mean, August",2242.707,2.502
12th or the 15th was when he ended his affiliation,2245.209,3.337
with the campaign.,2248.546,1.034
"So my point is, to suggest now that if you look at",2249.58,2.636
the final three months of the campaign where none of,2252.216,2.736
the individuals in question that Democrats,2254.952,2.503
brought up over and over again today were,2257.455,1.935
affiliated with the campaign -- to suggest,2259.39,2.536
that that somehow shows some high-level collusion,2261.926,1.835
is a bit of a stretch to say the least.,2263.761,2.236
The Press: And is the White House aware of any,2265.997,2.068
contacts between Paul Manafort and Russian,2268.065,2.336
operatives or suspected Russian operatives?,2270.401,1.635
Mr. Spicer: No.,2272.036,0.968
The Press: He joined in March.,2273.004,1.968
"Sean, you&amp;#39;ve been really critical of reports that",2274.972,2.569
are based on sources in the past.,2277.541,2.403
Today it seems like the two headlines that we got,2279.944,1.802
"out of the committee were, one, an official",2281.746,3.77
confirmation directly from the FBI and the Justice,2285.516,2.169
Department that there is an ongoing criminal,2287.685,3.036
investigation into whether associates of the sitting,2290.721,2.937
President had contacts with Russia and Russian,2293.658,2.969
"operatives, and whether there was any",2296.627,2.536
coordination between those.,2299.163,1.268
And the second headline being that there is an,2300.431,3.003
"official -- you had questioned in the past,",2303.434,2.402
"Priebus a couple weeks ago, when there were",2305.836,3.237
reports in our paper and others that the FBI,2309.073,2.436
director was indicating that there was no support,2311.509,2.302
"for President&amp;#39;s tweets, you said, well, those are",2313.811,1.802
just reports; those are not coming from his mouth,2315.613,2.736
-- he hasn&amp;#39;t said it.,2318.349,0.667
"Okay, we&amp;#39;ve now got it from his mouth directly,",2319.016,2.102
"in open testimony, that there is no evidence that",2321.118,2.403
he has to support the President&amp;#39;s tweets.,2323.521,3.336
"I guess the question is, do those two facts, which",2326.857,3.103
are now on the record and not attributed to,2329.96,3.537
anonymous sourcing -- does that cause this White,2333.497,2.736
House any concern?,2336.233,1.569
"And how come you treat the one -- the latter, the one",2337.802,4.504
about wiretapping -- you want to say that&amp;#39;s just in,2342.306,2.236
"the early stages, but on the former one, you want",2344.542,3.069
to sort of come to the conclusion that the,2347.611,4.138
investigation has sort of gotten to the point where,2351.749,2.703
you don&amp;#39;t have to worry about that because that&amp;#39;s,2354.452,1.935
all said and done and everybody has come to the,2356.387,1.735
conclusion on that?,2358.122,0.667
So that seems like you&amp;#39;re treating both of those,2358.789,1.669
pieces of news very differently.,2360.458,1.334
"Mr. Spicer: Well, first, I think your",2361.792,1.335
headlines are bad.,2363.127,0.834
I&amp;#39;m glad to rewrite -- The Press: I don&amp;#39;t think that.,2363.961,2.836
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;d be glad to if you guys are looking,2366.797,3.103
for some help.,2369.9,0.868
(Laughter.),2370.768,0.667
The Press: Are you looking for a job?,2371.435,1.869
Mr. Spicer: Our services are at the New York Times&amp;#39;,2373.304,2.469
"disposal if it comes to writing headlines, and we",2375.773,2.402
"could probably do a couple things on stories too, if",2378.175,1.936
you&amp;#39;re willing to go there.,2380.111,3.236
I think because there&amp;#39;s a big difference.,2383.347,1.735
"One is, literally talking -- there&amp;#39;s",2385.082,4.104
a big difference.,2389.186,0.701
Everyone keeps conflating that there is an,2389.887,2.002
investigation into the 2016 election.,2391.889,2.603
Got it -- no disagreement there.,2394.492,2.569
Right?,2397.061,0.667
But I think that there&amp;#39;s a question about collusion,2397.728,1.869
between anybody.,2399.597,1.034
"And my point has been to say over and over again,",2400.631,2.503
"to the dismay of every one of you guys, is that when",2403.134,2.936
the people who have been briefed by the FBI about,2406.07,3.97
"collusion between individuals, the answer",2410.04,2.369
continues to be &amp;quot;no.&amp;quot;,2412.409,2.036
"And at some point, take no for an answer.",2414.445,2.969
"When these people, both sides of the aisle --",2417.414,3.304
"Obama appointees, elected Democrats, elected",2420.718,2.269
"Republicans -- say &amp;quot;no evidence suggested,&amp;quot; at",2422.987,3.136
"some point it&amp;#39;s not just about me, it&amp;#39;s about you:",2426.123,2.936
Take no for an answer.,2429.059,1.235
And realize that the people -- while you can,2430.294,1.802
"have an investigation, it doesn&amp;#39;t necessarily mean",2432.096,2.469
"that you have to jump to the conclusion that, ah",2434.565,1.768
"ha, it must be about the collusion between",2436.333,2.77
those two things.,2439.103,1.068
They&amp;#39;ve talked about this for a long time.,2440.171,2.002
The 17 intelligence agencies have talked about,2442.173,2.869
an ongoing investigation into Russia&amp;#39;s involvement,2445.042,2.803
in the election.,2447.845,0.901
That&amp;#39;s vastly different than jumping to the,2448.746,1.668
"conclusion and saying that there must be somehow,",2450.414,2.202
"therefore, a collusion between individuals",2452.616,3.103
on one side.,2455.719,1.135
They don&amp;#39;t talk about all of the Hillary Clinton,2456.854,1.868
"collusion that may or may not have occurred, and",2458.722,1.969
that was a subject that came up with a Russian,2460.691,1.635
"official, and yet that has not gotten pursued once.",2462.326,3.17
There were zero minutes paid on the evening news,2465.496,2.969
"the other night, when that Russian official said that",2468.465,3.17
they had attempted to reach out to,2471.635,1.335
both campaigns.,2472.97,0.934
Zero minutes.,2473.904,1.168
"I know, I know -- see, I&amp;#39;m an equal opportunity --",2475.072,2.369
"The Press: But can I just ask, does the President",2477.441,2.436
need to take no for an answer in the same way,2479.877,2.135
that you&amp;#39;re urging the news media to on this?,2482.012,1.836
"Mr. Spicer: No, because one is a bunch of people",2483.848,1.901
"who have been briefed who are saying, we",2485.749,1.335
haven&amp;#39;t seen anything.,2487.084,0.667
"And one is an ongoing -- because, again, when you",2487.751,2.803
"ask them, they are getting at -- the President was",2490.554,1.802
"very clear, and I think there is continuing to be",2492.356,2.135
"a very, very literal interpretation of his",2494.491,2.703
"tweet, which is whether or not there was wiretapping.",2497.194,2.102
The President understands that you don&amp;#39;t literally,2499.296,1.869
wiretap people the same way that you did in the,2501.165,2.369
&amp;#39;70s and &amp;#39;80s with wires and things in the phone.,2503.534,3.57
The Press: Director Comey didn&amp;#39;t,2507.104,1.435
focus on wiretapping.,2508.539,0.867
He focused on the question of surveillance.,2509.406,2.002
"Mr. Spicer: No, but again, I think that we are still",2511.408,3.137
at the beginning phase of a look as to what kind of,2514.545,2.536
"surveillance occurred and why, and that there&amp;#39;s a",2517.081,2.335
"question about what leaks occurred,",2519.416,2.269
why they&amp;#39;re happening.,2521.685,1.035
"And again, just Director Comey -- because I believe",2522.72,2.769
one of the big headlines that should come out of,2525.489,1.635
today is that when he talks about the unusually,2527.124,2.736
"high amount of leaks that are coming out of this,",2529.86,3.17
"and classified information leaks, that in itself",2533.03,2.603
should be a question: Why is so much information,2535.633,2.102
being leaked out now?,2537.735,1.468
What are the motives behind it?,2539.203,1.535
Who is doing it?,2540.738,1.535
And is it threatening our national security?,2542.273,1.701
Which I do believe the answer is yes.,2543.974,1.969
But there&amp;#39;s a lot of other stories.,2545.943,1.368
"And that&amp;#39;s why I think, with all due respect to",2547.311,2.636
"your two headlines coming out, I do believe there&amp;#39;s",2549.947,2.269
a lot of headlines coming out.,2552.216,1.268
It&amp;#39;s just that the only headlines that people want,2553.484,2.135
to write are the ones that support a narrative,2555.619,2.87
"against this administration, and not",2558.489,1.535
one that actually looks into how many times do,2560.024,2.602
people say that there was no evidence of something,2562.626,2.87
happening; how many times -- or how much classified,2565.496,3.003
information is being leaked.,2568.499,2.135
There&amp;#39;s a lot of headlines that should be written,2570.634,1.969
today about a lot of stuff that&amp;#39;s ongoing.,2572.603,2.502
"And I know that we have an ongoing hearing, but",2575.105,1.502
there&amp;#39;s a lot of other things that need to get,2576.607,1.902
discussed and aren&amp;#39;t being happening.,2578.509,2.035
Why did the DNC not let the FBI look,2580.544,2.803
at their servers?,2583.347,0.867
Why is that story not -- because I would assume,2584.214,2.903
"that if somebody was a victim of something, which",2587.117,2.169
they have yelled from the rooftops --,2589.286,1.435
The Press: And you --,2590.721,0.767
The Press: The President made the allegation.,2591.488,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: Hold on, hold on --",2592.823,0.868
"The Press: I&amp;#39;m sorry, I&amp;#39;m curious -- the implication",2593.691,1.701
of that is what?,2595.392,0.768
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, the question is, why is none",2596.16,2.335
of that being looked at?,2598.495,1.368
The Press: I understand the question. But --,2599.863,2.269
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know what the -- but my,2602.132,1.335
"point is, is that, not to draw an implication, but",2603.467,1.735
"to merely ask a question, which all I&amp;#39;m getting at",2605.202,2.903
is that suddenly none of the questions regarding,2608.105,2.469
any of this seemed to get asked or answered,2610.574,2.469
or explored.,2613.043,1.201
And yet --,2614.244,0.668
The Press: But you won. You&amp;#39;re here.,2614.912,2.235
"Mr. Spicer: Brian, you get the same treatment that",2617.147,1.735
Jonathan does.,2618.882,0.668
That doesn&amp;#39;t mean you get to jump in.,2619.55,1.802
"So the answer that I&amp;#39;m getting at is, why are",2621.352,3.003
none of those questions being asked?,2624.355,1.334
Why is no one taking no for an answer when it,2625.689,2.369
comes to all of these individuals saying that,2628.058,2.803
they&amp;#39;ve seen nothing?,2630.861,1.101
But there are a series of headlines that I would,2631.962,2.002
"suggest need to get written and,",2633.964,1.368
"frankly, stories.",2635.332,1.068
"I&amp;#39;m glad to do that, as I offered.",2636.4,1.835
George.,2638.235,0.667
The Press: I&amp;#39;d like to try to clarify two things.,2638.902,3.037
"In the future, when you, from that podium, read",2641.939,3.87
"from news articles or cite news articles, can we",2645.809,5.039
assume that you&amp;#39;re vouching for the accuracy,2650.848,2.669
of those articles?,2653.517,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I think merely reading a story that&amp;#39;s in,2654.184,2.603
"a paper is not vouching for it, it&amp;#39;s",2656.787,1.468
reading the story.,2658.255,0.801
The Press: It doesn&amp;#39;t put a White House --,2659.056,1.902
Mr. Spicer: No.,2660.958,0.967
I think reading a series of things when asked a,2661.925,2.002
"question, &amp;quot;where is this narrative coming from,&amp;quot;",2663.927,2.67
and citing a multitude of stories that are in the,2666.597,4.07
public domain is not necessarily endorsing,2670.667,2.269
everything I read.,2672.936,1.202
That&amp;#39;s a silly assertion.,2674.138,2.869
We&amp;#39;re reading stories that you and your colleagues --,2677.007,2.803
and not necessarily you at National Journal -- have,2679.81,2.436
"put out, but several people in here whose",2682.246,1.802
publication have put something out.,2684.048,2.235
Simply reciting those,2686.283,2.202
things is not an endorsement.,2688.485,1.268
"The Press: The second thing is, when you talked",2689.753,3.971
"to the British about the GCHQ thing, did you tell",2693.724,4.304
them that the White House would not,2698.028,2.069
raise that again?,2700.097,0.701
Or can you talk about that conversation?,2700.798,1.501
Mr. Spicer: There was merely an explanation of,2702.299,3.937
"what we did and why we did it, which is what",2706.236,2.436
I just said to you.,2708.672,0.934
And that was it -- simply that.,2709.606,1.969
"Thank you, guys, for that.",2711.575,1.068
We&amp;#39;ll see you tomorrow.,2712.643,0.767
Hopefully some of you get a chance to go down today.,2713.41,2.369
"If you don&amp;#39;t, we&amp;#39;ll have a readout.",2715.779,1.335
Thank you.,2717.114,5.005
