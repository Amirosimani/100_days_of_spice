"Mr. Spicer: Hi, guys.",0.9,2.67
The hearing is still -- Judge Gorsuch&amp;#39;s hearing is,3.57,2.402
"ongoing, and considering the significant attention,",5.972,3.67
I&amp;#39;m going to try to keep this a little on the,9.642,1.902
shorter side today.,11.544,2.97
The President is making a full day of progress,14.514,2.135
towards some of his biggest promises that he&amp;#39;s,16.649,1.702
made to the American people.,18.351,1.668
This morning he met with the House Republican,20.019,1.635
"Conference members on Capitol Hill, ahead of the",21.654,2.336
House&amp;#39;s scheduled vote on the American Health Care,23.99,1.935
"Act, which is currently scheduled for Thursday.",25.925,3.237
"During the meeting, the President reminded members",29.162,2.603
of the House Conference that repealing and,31.765,1.434
replacing Obamacare has been a promise that,33.199,2.436
Republicans have been,35.635,0.701
making to voters for years.,36.336,1.768
Members have made it clear that if voters put a,38.104,3.203
Republican in the White House and continue,41.307,2.336
Republican majorities in the House and the Senate,43.643,2.369
that we would repeal and replace this,46.012,2.469
ill-advised legislation.,48.481,2.77
And for every member who pledged to the American,51.251,1.768
"people that they would deliver on this promise,",53.019,2.336
this is really their chance.,55.355,1.935
This is the repeal of Obamacare that Republicans,57.29,3.137
"have been working on for years, and voters have",60.427,2.302
been waiting for this for some time.,62.729,2.002
"On Thursday, as the House gathers on the floor and",64.731,1.968
"casts their votes for the ACH, it will be exactly",66.699,2.937
seven years after President Obama had signed,69.636,2.969
Obamacare into law.,72.605,1.602
We&amp;#39;re hoping to make this the last anniversary,74.207,2.035
Americans will have to endure Obamacare.,76.242,2.503
Republicans have been working to repeal and,78.745,1.835
replace this misguided law ever since.,80.58,2.336
"And now, under President Trump, we will finally be",82.916,2.168
able to take this step towards fundamental reform,85.084,3.07
of our healthcare system.,88.154,1.535
I think most Americans remember the lines that,89.689,1.969
were used to sell Obamacare seven years ago:,91.658,2.636
"&amp;quot;If you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor.&amp;quot;",94.294,2.169
"&amp;quot;If you like your healthcare plan, you&amp;#39;ll be",96.463,1.701
able to keep your healthcare plan.&amp;quot;,98.164,1.335
"But for millions of Americans, those lines",99.499,2.803
proved to be nothing more than empty promises.,102.302,2.936
Plans that their families had relied on for years,105.238,2.236
were suddenly cancelled.,107.474,1.568
"Premiums and deductibles skyrocketed, leaving many",109.042,3.236
who had plans unable to actually use them.,112.278,2.67
And insurers fled the marketplace.,114.948,2.569
Nearly one in five Americans only have one,117.517,4.137
insurer offering plans on their Obamacare exchange.,121.654,3.27
President Trump and Republicans in Congress,124.924,2.169
will keep their promise by reforming the system,127.093,2.436
once and for all.,129.529,0.767
And that&amp;#39;s exactly what we&amp;#39;re doing with the,130.296,2.77
"American Health Care Act, which, along with the",133.066,2.169
additional legislative and administrative action that,135.235,2.402
is part of the three-prong approach that we continue,137.637,2.202
"to outline, will finally give all Americans the",139.839,2.503
"healthcare system they deserve, where",142.342,1.835
"market-based competition leads to more affordable,",144.177,3.303
higher-quality care opportunities.,147.48,3.37
"This is an ongoing process, and the President",150.85,1.935
has made it clear to Congress that they should,152.785,1.469
be open to incorporating some of the common-sense,154.254,2.535
policy proposals that have been suggested by members,156.789,2.97
in both chambers who share their commitment to,159.759,3.27
improving the healthcare system.,163.029,1.835
"To that end, the House introduced several",164.864,2.036
technical and policy amendments to the,166.9,2.035
"legislation last night, which the President",168.935,2.102
acknowledged on Capitol Hill this morning.,171.037,2.035
They include: Delivering more immediate relief from,173.072,2.803
"Obamacare&amp;#39;s taxes, accelerating the repeal of",175.875,2.936
"these taxes from 2017 rather than from 2018, and",178.811,3.604
ensuring that millions of Americans who paid,182.415,1.935
Obamacare&amp;#39;s penalties or taxes can reclaim their,184.35,2.903
hard-earned dollars from the IRS.,187.253,2.369
It&amp;#39;s making it easier for Americans to deduct more,189.622,2.336
of the costs of their medical expenses.,191.958,2.202
Protecting life by prohibiting taxpayer,194.16,1.902
dollars from being used to help purchase insurance,196.062,2.469
plans that currently cover abortion.,198.531,2.236
Giving states additional flexibility for their,200.767,1.935
Medicaid program covering traditional adult and,202.702,3.303
"children populations, while maintaining baseline",206.005,2.67
funding for elderly and disabled populations.,208.675,3.436
"Giving states the ability to implement optional,",212.111,2.336
reasonable work requirements for,214.447,1.969
able-bodied adults without dependents as part of,216.416,2.435
their Medicaid programs.,218.851,1.669
Freezing Obamacare&amp;#39;s Medicaid expansion while,220.52,2.869
"allowing for a responsible unwinding, so that people",223.389,3.27
who enroll before 2020 will continue to be,226.659,3.671
supported by the program.,230.33,1.868
And providing a more generous reimbursement for,232.198,2.336
"elderly and disabled Medicaid enrollees,",234.534,3.203
recognizing that those populations have unique,237.737,2.269
needs that must be taken care of.,240.006,2.903
After a return to the White House from the House,242.909,2.402
"-- speaking to the House Republican Conference, the",245.311,2.002
President received his Daily Intelligence,247.313,1.635
Briefing.,248.948,0.868
"Then the President signed S.442, the NASA",249.816,2.702
Administration Transition Authorization Act for,252.518,3.838
"2017, acting on another of the President&amp;#39;s most",256.356,3.737
ambitious promise to the American people.,260.093,2.569
"Many may recall in his joint address, the",262.662,2.269
President said of a dream.&amp;quot;,264.931,1.268
"And with this bill, he is taking the latest step",266.199,1.334
towards making that dream a reality by reiterating,267.533,1.335
NASA&amp;#39;s mission to ensure America remains a leader,268.868,1.335
in space exploration.,270.203,2.002
"This bipartisan, bicameral legislation provides NASA",280.813,3.17
with the full support it needs to fulfill this and,283.983,2.603
"many other important missions, including:",286.586,2.636
supporting NASA&amp;#39;s plan to explore deep space and,289.222,2.669
"sending astronauts to Mars, including an",291.891,2.236
endorsement of launching the Mars 2020 Rover.,294.127,2.869
The rover will explore a site that is likely to,296.996,2.269
"have been habitable, seeking signs of past life",299.265,3.003
and testing compelling samples and techniques for,302.268,2.436
future robotic and eventual human exploration,304.704,2.436
of Mars. Reaffirming that,307.14,1.735
NASA remains a fully multi-mission agency with,308.875,3.87
"a balanced set of core missions in space science,",312.745,3.337
"space technology, aeronautics, human space flight,",316.082,3.103
"exploration, and education.",319.185,3.103
Endorsing NASA&amp;#39;s continued progress towards launching,322.288,2.736
"the James Webb Telescope, which will be a giant leap",325.024,2.97
forward in our ever-evolving quest to,327.994,1.935
"understand the universe, and establishing an",329.929,2.302
"astronaut occupational healthcare program,",332.231,2.503
something that NASA has considered a,334.734,2.035
priority for years.,336.769,1.535
"After the bill signing, the Vice President also",338.304,1.835
announced that the President will be taking,340.139,1.435
action shortly to relaunch the National Space,341.574,2.603
"Council, which the Vice President will chair.",344.177,2.669
The President was honored to sign this new bill into,346.846,1.802
law so that NASA can continue its work towards,348.648,2.969
making America the world leader in space,351.617,2.369
exploration once again.,353.986,1.869
"Also this morning, the President -- the Vice",355.855,2.236
"President, rather, hosted a breakfast meeting with",358.091,2.535
Prime Minister al-Abadi of Iraq.,360.626,2.636
We provided a readout on the President&amp;#39;s meeting,363.262,2.57
"with the Prime Minister yesterday as well, and I",365.832,2.102
believe there has been a readout of the Vice,367.934,2.102
President&amp;#39;s as well.,370.036,0.967
At 3:00 p.m.,371.003,1.268
"this afternoon, the President will meet with",372.271,1.635
members of Congress who are part of the House,373.906,2.636
Tuesday Group to discuss,376.542,1.535
the American Health Care Act.,378.077,1.568
"And this evening, the President will speak at",379.645,1.402
the National Republican Congressional,381.047,1.501
Committee March Dinner.,382.548,1.368
"Over on the Senate side of the Hill, the President&amp;#39;s",383.916,2.203
"pick for the Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch",386.119,1.334
has been doing a phenomenal job in the,387.453,1.368
Senate today during his first day of questioning.,388.821,1.335
The judge&amp;#39;s eloquent testimony yesterday was,390.156,1.335
"widely praised from both sides of the aisle, and",391.491,1.334
"it&amp;#39;s clear that everyone agrees, from a broad",392.825,1.335
"spectrum, that Judge Gorsuch is a very",394.16,1.335
qualified person to serve on the Supreme Court.,395.495,1.368
"As the Judge noted today, &amp;quot;a judge is there to make",396.863,1.334
"sure that every person, poor or rich, mighty",398.197,5.005
"or meek, gets equal",408.641,3.403
protection of [under] the law.&amp;quot;,412.044,1.168
His records show that he has lived up to this,413.212,2.803
"commitment throughout his entire career, and he&amp;#39;s",416.015,2.302
continuing to prove that he is exactly the type of,418.317,2.303
jurist we need on the Supreme Court throughout,420.62,2.335
the questioning that&amp;#39;s started today.,422.955,2.336
"Today is also National Agriculture Day, for those",425.291,2.369
who are keeping note.,427.66,1.735
The world needs America&amp;#39;s farmers and ranchers to,429.395,2.403
"lead, just as the world needs America to lead.",431.798,2.469
Global food demand is expected to increase by 50,434.267,2.636
to 97 percent by 2050.,436.903,2.502
The world can&amp;#39;t afford for America&amp;#39;s farmers and,439.405,2.369
"ranchers to retreat, but the agriculture industry",441.774,2.703
has met its share of challenges in recent,444.477,1.401
years.,445.878,0.935
While our farmers are the most efficient in the,446.813,1.534
"world, margins have been tightening, regulations",448.347,2.67
"have been multiplying, and exports, which have",451.017,2.402
historically counted for over one-fifth of U.S.,453.419,2.336
"farm production, have been declining due to unwise",455.755,3.403
trade policies.,459.158,1.568
The President promised the many people in the,460.726,1.569
agriculture industry and throughout rural America,462.295,3.169
"that he would not allow this to continue, and he",465.464,1.702
will continue to pursue policy changes that will,467.166,2.936
reverse this disturbing trend.,470.102,2.002
"Quickly, in terms of follow-up from yesterday,",472.104,1.702
"I was asked about North Korea, and I wanted to",473.806,1.602
"provide an update from the NSC: &amp;quot;The United States,",475.408,3.27
"in coordination with our allies, is exploring a new",478.678,2.769
"range of diplomatic, security, and economic",481.447,2.803
measures in response to the grave and escalating,484.25,2.736
threat posed by North Korea&amp;#39;s nuclear and,486.986,2.569
ballistic missile programs.&amp;quot;,489.555,2.002
"And before I open it up for questions, let me run",491.557,2.97
through a few scheduling updates.,494.527,1.702
"Tomorrow, the President will stop by the Women in",496.229,3.303
Healthcare panel hosted by,499.532,1.835
CMS Administrator Seema Verma.,501.367,2.135
There will also be a series of meetings with,503.502,1.535
members of Congress tomorrow.,505.037,1.669
"In the morning, the President will meet with",506.706,1.434
members to discuss the American Health Care Act.,508.14,2.837
And in the afternoon he will meet with,510.977,1.334
congressional -- members,512.311,1.068
of the Congressional Black Caucus.,513.379,1.802
"On Thursday, the President will have lunch with",515.181,1.601
Secretary of the Treasury Mnuchin before hosting a,516.782,3.003
meeting with truckers and representatives from,519.785,2.77
trucking companies on healthcare that we,522.555,1.568
discussed yesterday.,524.123,1.535
"In many states throughout the country, trucking",525.658,2.402
"happens to be one of the largest employers, and",528.06,2.236
it&amp;#39;s important to understand the impact of,530.296,1.802
healthcare legislation on this important industry.,532.098,4.404
I&amp;#39;ll have updates on the weekend schedule for you,536.502,2.035
hopefully tomorrow.,538.537,1.402
"And finally, yesterday, pursuant to the",539.939,1.535
President&amp;#39;s executive order on interior,541.474,2.035
"enforcement that he signed on January 25th, the U.S.",543.509,3.404
"Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency, ICE,",546.913,3.97
"released its first weekly list of detainee requests,",550.883,3.504
which local law enforcement agencies have,554.387,1.735
failed to comply with.,556.122,1.401
These examples where criminal illegals who have,557.523,2.436
"been arrested or convicted, in many cases,",559.959,2.336
of serious and violent,562.295,0.934
crimes threaten public safety.,563.229,1.935
"In each instance, local law enforcement is",565.164,1.869
refusing to cooperate with ICE in its efforts to,567.033,2.702
remove illegal immigrants,569.735,1.635
who have committed a crime.,571.37,1.268
It is part of the President&amp;#39;s continued,572.638,2.636
efforts to keep our communities safe.,575.274,1.935
A copy of this report is available on the ICE,577.209,2.603
website that details all of the municipalities,579.812,2.836
where there has been an issue and the crime that,582.648,4.605
"has been committed, and the person -- not",587.253,1.968
"necessarily the person&amp;#39;s name, but the offense in",589.221,2.903
which they were convicted for.,592.124,1.068
"And with that, I&amp;#39;d be glad to take a few questions.",593.192,3.103
Since we&amp;#39;re talking Supreme Court -- John Roberts.,596.295,2.936
(Laughter.),599.231,0.668
Come on.,599.899,0.667
That was good.,600.566,1.068
The Press: Unless there&amp;#39;s an Alito in the audience.,601.634,5.005
"On healthcare, the President came away from",610.676,1.869
Capitol Hill sounding pretty positive about,612.545,3.236
"where he was going to go on Thursday, but then at",615.781,2.336
"the same time, Heritage Action came out and said",618.117,2.502
it was going to encourage members to vote &amp;quot;no.&amp;quot;,620.619,2.57
Club for Growth is taking,623.189,1.701
out ads attacking this bill.,624.89,1.735
"Jim Jordan said the President&amp;#39;s great, but",626.625,2.069
it&amp;#39;s still a bad bill.,628.694,1.535
This is going to go to a vote day after tomorrow.,630.229,2.069
What gives the President the sense of optimism that,632.298,3.537
"he can get this through, and might he request more",635.835,3.17
changes from Speaker Ryan before it goes to a vote?,639.005,2.369
"Mr. Spicer: Well, we&amp;#39;ve talked about",641.374,1.334
this for days.,642.708,0.668
There&amp;#39;s been a lot of input from members of,643.376,1.334
"Congress, and I think that the meeting this morning",644.71,1.335
really was a huge sign of support.,646.045,5.005
"There was a lot of enthusiasm and optimism,",653.686,3.303
not just for the bill itself but for something,656.989,2.669
"that, as I noted, conservatives and",659.658,1.869
"Republicans and a lot of Democrats, frankly, have",661.527,1.835
"been fighting for for a while, which is a more",663.362,2.469
patient-centric healthcare system.,665.831,1.669
I think the President is continuing to,667.5,2.035
engage with members.,669.535,0.801
He will continue to do that all the way,670.336,2.235
through Thursday.,672.571,0.801
"But as I also noted, there were a lot of changes that",673.372,3.937
"were made by the Speaker last night, additional",677.309,3.804
legislation -- the three-pronged approach,681.113,1.835
that we&amp;#39;ve talked about in the past has been put,682.948,1.402
forward to actually make sure that members,684.35,2.836
understood the comprehensive,687.186,1.735
nature of this.,688.921,0.934
This is one vehicle.,689.855,1.268
There&amp;#39;s a huge administrative piece that,691.123,1.802
Secretary Price will administer through,692.925,3.036
administrative action that was given to them when,695.961,2.203
they passed this bill and gave that authority to,698.164,2.736
"Kathleen Sebelius, then the Secretary of Health",700.9,2.602
"and Human Services, to implement pieces that they",703.502,2.336
couldn&amp;#39;t get done legislatively.,705.838,1.501
We can now unwind a lot of that and add a lot of,707.339,3.07
consumer-based and competition measures,710.409,4.104
through the administrative thing.,714.513,1.335
"But then the third prong, all the other stuff that",715.848,1.635
we&amp;#39;ve talked about for years as Republicans --,717.483,2.569
"buying across state lines, expanding health savings",720.052,2.136
"accounts, et cetera, et cetera -- all of that has",722.188,2.702
now been introduced as well.,724.89,1.669
And I think that he continues to meet with,726.559,3.036
"members and walk away with a very, very optimistic",729.595,3.77
view of where the bill is headed.,733.365,1.669
I think a lot of the measures that have been,735.034,1.735
changed and tweaked and updated have assuaged,736.769,4.171
members who had concerns or wanted to see some,740.94,1.902
additional tightening.,742.842,0.667
"But keep in mind, if you are a conservative who has",743.509,4.671
"been fighting for repeal and replace,",748.18,2.703
this is your chance.,750.883,1.268
If you are a conservative who has been looking to,752.151,2.703
"address out-of-control entitlement spending, this",754.854,3.103
is the first attempt -- this is the first reform,757.957,4.037
of an entitlement program in terms of Medicaid,761.994,2.002
in 30 years.,763.996,1.068
These are a truly conservative set of,765.064,2.803
principles that we are fighting for.,767.867,1.468
"The competition that&amp;#39;s in the bill, the ability to",769.335,5.472
"allow prices to come down and choice to go up, there",774.807,2.969
is nothing more conservative than there,777.776,1.502
is in this bill.,779.278,0.667
And I think as members continue to talk about,779.945,2.403
"ideas that have been included in this bill, and",782.348,2.502
"the principles of it, we feel very good going into",784.85,2.569
the final stretch.,787.419,0.668
The Press: But may he seek more changes in order to,788.087,2.269
further assuage some --,790.356,1.001
Mr. Spicer: It&amp;#39;s possible. But I think that we&amp;#39;ve,791.357,1.768
made some very positive steps forward.,793.125,1.769
"So I don&amp;#39;t want to rule anything out, but I will",794.894,3.403
say that I feel very good about this where,798.297,1.969
it stands now.,800.266,0.667
And I think the more and more that members meet,800.933,2.302
"with the President, the more they understand how",803.235,3.971
important this is to the overall agenda that we&amp;#39;re,807.206,2.502
seeking to pass.,809.708,0.968
And I think if we can -- as the President noted,810.676,2.069
"this morning to members, if you can repeal",812.745,2.636
"Obamacare, replace it with a healthcare system that",815.381,4.104
"does what conservatives and independents, and,",819.485,2.402
"frankly, some Democrats have talked about it for",821.887,1.568
"years, that does exactly that kind of thing --",823.455,2.837
"instill choice, drive down costs, allows people to",826.292,3.169
"actually get care that they&amp;#39;ve been promised, and",829.461,2.403
then get on to things like tax reform -- we will have,831.864,2.636
an amazing first year in office.,834.5,1.835
And I think the President reminded them this is the,836.335,2.302
first step in an amazing agenda that he set forth,838.637,3.37
and that we can work together on.,842.007,1.368
Eamon.,843.375,0.668
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",844.043,0.934
Members of this administration have talked,844.977,1.868
about the stock market as a real-time barometer for,846.845,2.87
how the administration is performing.,849.715,1.568
"But this afternoon, though, the stock market",851.283,1.802
has been off as much as 200 points on the Dow.,853.085,2.903
Some commentators on Wall Street are suggesting,855.988,1.868
that&amp;#39;s because traders are starting to sense a lack,857.856,2.37
"of progress in the Trump legislative agenda,",860.226,1.835
worried that he might not be able to accomplish,862.061,2.402
everything he set out to do.,864.463,1.568
Does the President believe that today&amp;#39;s dip in the,866.031,2.403
Dow is the result of his performance as President,868.434,2.235
of the United States?,870.669,0.968
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think to look at any one day is",871.637,4.237
nothing that we&amp;#39;ve ever -- we&amp;#39;ve always cautioned.,875.874,2.203
I think overall it still continues to be up,878.077,2.769
tremendously.,880.846,1.001
And I think when you look at not just that one,881.847,1.802
indicator -- I think if you want to get a -- I,883.649,1.735
"mean, you probably know better than anybody in",885.384,1.702
terms of what you guys cover -- that you can&amp;#39;t,887.086,2.569
look at one indices and say that that is the,889.655,3.303
benchmark of an entire economy.,892.958,1.435
"But you see confidence levels, both in small",894.393,2.369
"business and in other surveys, that show that",896.762,2.269
there is continued confidence in the market,899.031,3.003
and optimism in the market.,902.034,1.401
"You see manufacturers coming back to America,",903.435,2.57
talking about investment; major CEOs and small,906.005,3.203
businesses trying to grow the economy and talking,909.208,2.035
about job creation.,911.243,0.801
Those are the real indicators.,912.044,1.835
"And again, I think the numbers that we saw last",913.879,1.869
"month -- again, one month doesn&amp;#39;t make a record.",915.748,4.104
"But I think that it was very promising, not just",919.852,2.068
"because of what the number was, but what it had been",921.92,2.37
forecast to be -- right?,924.29,1.134
"So it was expected to be 200,000; it came",925.424,2.069
"in at 235,000.",927.493,1.835
"So, again, when you&amp;#39;re over-performing, I think",929.328,2.569
that shows a sign of optimism and,931.897,2.202
confidence in the market.,934.099,2.203
"I think -- again, I just want to make sure that",936.302,1.735
we&amp;#39;re clear before we go into -- as we continue,938.037,3.169
through the months.,941.206,0.968
One report does not make something to base an,942.174,2.936
entire record off of.,945.11,1.502
But I think that we feel very good about where,946.612,1.835
things are headed and the direction things are,948.447,2.035
"going, not just in terms of the indices and the ups",950.482,2.703
"and downs in the market, but also in terms of the",953.185,2.336
number of manufacturers that are walking in and,955.521,1.902
"restating their commitment to grow jobs, expand, et",957.423,3.603
"cetera, in the market.",961.026,0.868
The Press: -- feel confidence that President,961.894,1.334
Trump will be able to get a tax cut done this year,963.228,2.303
"that would be in place for next year, is that",965.531,1.902
something we should worry about at all?,967.433,1.334
"Mr. Spicer: Look, I think we&amp;#39;re well on our way to",968.767,1.869
seeing this agenda done.,970.636,0.934
"The President has rolled out the budget, which I",971.57,2.77
think reaffirmed his commitment to fiscal,974.34,1.801
austerity and to the priorities he set out of,976.141,2.336
"defending this country, making the increases in",978.477,4.538
national defense and homeland security that he,983.015,2.703
"promised, prioritizing other things",985.718,1.901
in the budget.,987.619,0.735
"We&amp;#39;ve got Obamacare done, on immigration,",988.354,2.335
executive order-wise.,990.689,1.035
And I think that when you&amp;#39;re doing big things --,991.724,3.436
"Obamacare, tax reform -- I mean, the healthcare",995.16,1.869
system is a fifth of the economy;,997.029,1.802
that&amp;#39;s not small fee.,998.831,0.901
And I think in terms of what you&amp;#39;ve seen so far --,999.732,2.702
"going through three committees, moving along",1002.434,2.569
"-- the Senate ready to take it up, his pick of",1005.003,1.836
Neil Gorsuch -- the agenda is moving along at a very,1006.839,2.903
brisk pace in terms of what his priorities were,1009.742,2.369
and where I think we&amp;#39;re headed.,1012.111,1.635
"The Press: Sean, last month, I guess, you talked",1013.746,3.57
"to us about the consideration,",1017.316,2.002
"potentially, of the carbon tax, which I guess was",1019.318,3.603
discussed in a meeting at the White House.,1022.921,3.304
We&amp;#39;re hearing some reports that there&amp;#39;s a pretty,1026.225,2.135
lively internal debate.,1028.36,1.835
Gary Cohn might be someone who&amp;#39;s more prone to that.,1030.195,3.771
"Can you just discuss, is the President",1033.966,1.601
considering a carbon tax?,1035.567,1.068
And what are sort of the various things that are,1036.635,2.269
going on in the White House with that?,1038.904,1.335
Mr. Spicer: I think there&amp;#39;s a robust debate,1040.239,1.368
going on with respect to comprehensive tax reform.,1041.607,3.57
"And as we&amp;#39;ve mentioned, I mean, our goal right now",1045.177,4.171
"is to get through Thursday, and that&amp;#39;s what",1049.348,2.235
the President has talked about very publicly.,1051.583,1.969
"We need to get Obamacare repealed and replaced, and",1053.552,3.337
move on to tax reform and some of the other trade,1056.889,2.435
reviews that we&amp;#39;ve talked about -- immigration.,1059.324,2.136
There&amp;#39;s a lot of things on the agenda.,1061.46,1.335
But I&amp;#39;m not going to comment on,1062.795,1.101
specific prongs of that.,1063.896,1.334
I will just tell you that obviously there&amp;#39;s a lot of,1065.23,2.236
people who recognize that we haven&amp;#39;t have,1067.466,1.568
"comprehensive tax reform since 1986, and that",1069.034,2.836
there&amp;#39;s a lot of pieces in this that we need to,1071.87,3.137
examine and get to and there&amp;#39;s a lot of voices,1075.007,2.335
and opinions that get shared with him.,1077.342,2.136
So I&amp;#39;m not in a position where I&amp;#39;m going to get,1079.478,3.003
"into commenting piecemeal on where it is, but I will",1082.481,3.303
say that&amp;#39;s even more reason that we -- let&amp;#39;s,1085.784,2.269
get past Thursday.,1088.053,1.869
"When you look at the week ahead real quick, Glenn,",1089.922,2.269
"in terms of this, the repeal-and-replace aspect",1092.191,2.502
"and Gorsuch, I think, from a legislative standpoint",1094.693,3.604
-- going back to Eamon&amp;#39;s question -- I think it&amp;#39;s a,1098.297,2.469
pretty big week for the White House to,1100.766,1.735
seeing all this done.,1102.501,0.667
Hunter.,1103.168,0.668
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",1103.836,0.934
President Trump has previously indicated that,1104.77,2.903
he wanted to appoint pro-life judges who would,1107.673,3.27
be willing to overturn Roe vs.,1110.943,1.468
"Wade, yet in his testimony today Judge Gorsuch said",1112.411,3.403
he would have walked out the door if President,1115.814,2.136
Trump asked if he had this position.,1117.95,2.669
Is President Trump still confident that Judge,1120.619,2.336
Gorsuch would be willing to overturn Roe vs. Wade?,1122.955,3.17
And is this position still important to him?,1126.125,2.035
Mr. Spicer: I think the President&amp;#39;s comments,1128.16,1.835
speak for themselves.,1129.995,0.834
I think the President&amp;#39;s list that he&amp;#39;s put out on,1130.829,1.935
20 are jurists that both the Federalist Society and,1132.764,2.97
Heritage have deemed to be people who interpret the,1135.734,2.569
"Constitution as originalists, as people",1138.303,3.27
who aren&amp;#39;t looking to legislate from the bench.,1141.573,2.536
And I&amp;#39;m not going to take the bait during a live,1144.109,2.503
hearing to comment on that but I,1146.612,2.035
appreciate the effort.,1148.647,1.235
Ronika.,1149.882,0.667
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",1150.549,1.068
I have two questions on the same story.,1151.617,2.402
"Recently a 14-year-old girl, she was raped in the",1154.019,3.604
boy&amp;#39;s bathroom of her high school.,1157.623,1.735
A 17- and 18-year-old boy have been charged.,1159.358,2.536
One of the boys we know unlawfully entered the,1161.894,2.802
country; both of them have outstanding,1164.696,1.902
orders with ICE.,1166.598,0.935
So here&amp;#39;s my first question about it:,1167.533,2.302
"Currently, schools are prohibited from denying",1169.835,2.269
access to public education,1172.104,1.635
based on immigration status.,1173.739,1.535
Does the President hear a story like that and think,1175.274,3.903
that it should change or be addressed in a,1179.177,3.504
future executive order?,1182.681,1.168
"Mr. Spicer: I think first, let me just say that this",1183.849,5.972
"is a tragic event, and it&amp;#39;s horrendous and",1189.821,2.002
horrible and disgusting what this young woman in,1191.823,2.436
Rockville went through.,1194.259,2.436
I can&amp;#39;t possibly imagine.,1196.695,2.936
"So first of all, let&amp;#39;s remember the human side of",1199.631,2.403
"this, that this is a tragic event that no",1202.034,4.471
"child, no person, no parent should ever",1206.505,2.202
have to deal with.,1208.707,1.068
Schools should be a place where a parent puts their,1209.775,2.936
child on a bus or drops them off or sees them off,1212.711,3.103
and knows that they&amp;#39;re safe.,1215.814,2.069
"And the idea that this occurred is shocking,",1217.883,4.304
"disturbing, horrific, and whatever other words that",1222.187,4.271
come to mind that someone can think of.,1226.458,1.768
Because this is not -- schools should be a safe,1228.226,2.203
place where children are there to learn and,1230.429,2.169
to feel safe.,1232.598,2.002
In that kind of environment -- to know,1235.4,1.669
that this happened and the circumstances -- this,1237.069,2.102
young women in particular fought to come to this,1239.171,2.936
country legally because of the freedoms and the,1242.107,3.403
treasures of this nation.,1245.51,1.635
And to think that this kind of tragedy would,1247.145,3.37
occur to someone who&amp;#39;s personally endured that,1250.515,2.903
kind of struggle to come to this nation and then,1253.418,2.903
face this is reprehensible.,1256.321,2.636
And it is not who we are as a country.,1258.957,2.469
"I think it is troubling, and I think further, to",1261.426,3.971
"your question, the President recognizes that",1265.397,3.337
education is a state-run and a local-run issue.,1268.734,2.802
But I think it is pause for concern what happened,1271.536,2.336
"there, and I think the city should look",1273.872,4.538
at its policies.,1278.41,3.003
And I think that this is something that authorities,1281.413,1.735
are going to have to look at.,1283.148,0.667
"I think from an immigration standpoint,",1283.815,1.735
clearly to see somebody -- there are so many facets,1285.55,3.27
of this case that deserve question -- why was there,1288.82,2.236
"a -- I think he was 17 or 18 years old -- 18, thank",1291.056,3.236
you -- and how does that person get put,1294.292,2.303
into the ninth grade?,1296.595,0.901
Why was -- there are so many issues that,1297.496,2.402
come up in this case.,1299.898,1.935
"I will leave it to authorities to get to, but",1301.833,1.769
I think that we are in the early stages of this and,1303.602,2.069
there&amp;#39;s a lot that needs to get addressed with,1305.671,2.235
respect to this case in particular.,1307.906,1.335
The Press: So I hear you about it being,1309.241,1.601
a state issue.,1310.842,0.668
"Let&amp;#39;s talk about something, though, that",1311.51,1.635
the President has implemented and introduced,1313.145,2.135
"VOICE -- VOICE, Victims of Immigration Crime",1315.28,2.97
Enforcement -- is that enough to support a --,1318.25,3.67
"Mr. Spicer: No, it&amp;#39;s one piece.",1321.92,1.502
"The President understands that victims need a voice,",1323.422,1.935
"which is why he brought it in there, to help them",1325.357,1.868
when they&amp;#39;re specifically targeted or victims of a,1327.225,4.004
crime by people who are here illegally.,1331.229,1.869
But I think part of the reason that the President,1333.098,1.902
has made illegal immigration and crackdown,1335,3.17
such a big deal is because of tragedies like this.,1338.17,3.036
We act so many times when we talk about this and say,1341.206,2.469
-- how is the President going to -- why is the,1343.675,2.636
President dealing with this -- because,1346.311,1.368
of this priority.,1347.679,0.801
"Well, part of the reason is because of the tragedy",1348.48,2.302
"that this young girl dealt with, had inflicted upon",1350.782,4.872
"her, whatever the word is -- this is why he&amp;#39;s",1355.654,1.334
"passionate about this, because people are victims",1356.988,1.335
of these crimes in terms of them -- they&amp;#39;re victims,1358.323,1.335
"of the economic pieces, there&amp;#39;s a",1359.658,1.334
national security.,1360.992,0.668
But immigration pays its toll on our people if it&amp;#39;s,1361.66,5.005
not done legally.,1370.635,1.235
"And this is another example, and it&amp;#39;s why the",1371.87,1.802
President is so passionate about this.,1373.672,1.535
"But he recognizes that it&amp;#39;s multifaceted, why we",1375.207,2.235
"have to be tough at the border, why I just read",1377.442,2.002
off that this executive order is dealing with,1379.444,2.77
people who have committed crimes who local,1382.214,2.435
"enforcement agencies, our municipalities of -- at",1384.649,2.203
the state level are not dealing with it.,1386.852,1.401
"And if you go to the ICE website and download this,",1388.253,3.504
you&amp;#39;ll see it&amp;#39;s over 30-something pages of,1391.757,2.902
cases where there&amp;#39;s a person that is convicted,1394.659,2.47
of a crime that local people -- local municipal,1397.129,3.236
"law enforcement, for whatever reason -- and in",1400.365,2.302
some cases they&amp;#39;re prohibited but for one,1402.667,2.603
reason or another are not enforcing the law and not,1405.27,2.536
turning that individual over to federal,1407.806,1.969
authorities to be deported.,1409.775,1.101
And I think this is another example of why,1410.876,2.869
this issue needs to be addressed.,1413.745,2.236
Jon.,1415.981,0.667
"The Press: Sean, is the President going to hold",1416.648,2.336
Republicans who vote,1418.984,0.901
against healthcare accountable?,1419.885,0.901
Are they going to pay a price if they vote against,1420.786,3.336
this bill?,1424.122,0.668
Mr. Spicer: I think they&amp;#39;ll probably pay a,1424.79,1.434
"price at home, meaning I think that you can&amp;#39;t go",1426.224,3.437
"promise over and over again, since 2010 -- in",1429.661,4.037
"the case the member has been there that long, but",1433.698,1.735
at least for those who have been there that long,1435.433,1.769
and at least -- and even the new ones -- this was a,1437.202,2.536
major component of the last election.,1439.738,2.702
And I think there is probably not a single,1442.44,1.602
Republican member in itself who went out and,1444.042,2.336
talked about this.,1446.378,0.801
And I think when you realize the components of,1447.179,2.535
this bill and that the President worked with the,1449.714,4.138
House and the Senate to put something together,1453.852,1.568
"that achieved a promise that was made to voters,",1455.42,2.603
"yeah, I think there&amp;#39;s going to be a price to be",1458.023,1.902
"paid, but it&amp;#39;s going to be with their own voters.",1459.925,2.168
And they&amp;#39;re going to have to go back and explain to,1462.093,1.802
them why they made a commitment to them and,1463.895,3.737
then didn&amp;#39;t follow through.,1467.632,0.935
And one of the things that&amp;#39;s interesting that,1468.567,2.068
people who agree or don&amp;#39;t agree with the President,1470.635,2.236
"in terms of legislative agenda, at least give him",1472.871,1.768
high remarks regardless of whether or not they,1474.639,2.069
"subscribe to his agenda, for keeping his word",1476.708,2.536
and his promises.,1479.244,0.867
And I think that&amp;#39;s one of the things that he&amp;#39;s made,1480.111,2.002
very clear this morning.,1482.113,1.268
We pledged to the American people at the,1483.381,2.503
"congressional level, at the Senate level, at the",1485.884,2.469
presidential level to go do something.,1488.353,3.003
"And this bill, while probably not everybody got",1491.356,3.203
"everything they wanted, does exactly what we said.",1494.559,2.503
It&amp;#39;s repealing it and replacing it with all of,1497.062,1.968
the principles and the aspects that we discussed,1499.03,2.336
throughout not only last cycle but in a lot of,1501.366,1.768
these cases back through 2010.,1503.134,1.535
Margaret.,1504.669,1.068
The Press: Will he campaign against,1505.737,1.735
those Republicans?,1507.472,1.034
Mr. Spicer: Let&amp;#39;s get through the vote.,1508.506,1.836
I think one of the things that he made clear this,1510.342,1.334
morning was that he was going to make sure that,1511.676,1.335
"the people who did support this, he would be out",1513.011,2.202
there supporting them.,1515.213,1.802
And so I&amp;#39;m not going to focus on the negative as,1517.015,3.17
much as the positive today.,1520.185,1.134
And he made it clear to members that for those of,1521.319,2.002
you who go out there and keep your word and support,1523.321,2.603
"it, we&amp;#39;re going to make sure that we remember",1525.924,1.868
those who stood by us and who stood by the word that,1527.792,3.17
they gave to their voters.,1530.962,0.935
Margaret.,1531.897,0.667
The Press: Thanks.,1532.564,0.701
"Okay, so I was actually -- that&amp;#39;s one I was going to",1533.265,2.268
"ask, but let me try to --",1535.533,1.502
Mr. Spicer: Oh.,1537.035,0.667
"The Press: No, that&amp;#39;s okay, I&amp;#39;ve got another",1537.702,1.735
"one, don&amp;#39;t worry.",1539.437,0.701
So my other one -- but I&amp;#39;m going to go back to that,1540.138,3.537
-- is on the laptop restrictions by the U.S.,1543.675,2.536
"and now the UK, it certainly sounds like that",1546.211,2.803
may have been in response to some kind of a specific,1549.014,3.003
security threat.,1552.017,0.667
What can you talk about from the podium in as much,1552.684,3.737
"specificity as you can, and if you can&amp;#39;t do",1556.421,3.07
specifics at least to help us to understand -- are,1559.491,3.403
"there multiple threats, is there one threat, what is",1562.894,3.07
going on here?,1565.964,1.001
Mr. Spicer: So yesterday the TSA announced new,1566.965,2.836
enhanced measures on flights inbound to the,1569.801,2.102
United States from 10 of more than the 250,1571.903,3.837
countries that have flights coming into the,1575.74,2.169
United States that serve as the last,1577.909,2.669
point of departure.,1580.578,0.735
I think even ranking member of the House,1581.313,2.335
"Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, who we&amp;#39;ve not",1583.648,2.069
"always shared the same point of view with, even",1585.717,1.969
"agreed by saying, &amp;quot;These steps are both necessary",1587.686,2.335
and proportional to the threat.&amp;quot;,1590.021,2.202
Elevated [Evaluated] intelligence that we&amp;#39;re,1592.223,2.269
aware of indicates that terrorist groups continue,1594.492,1.902
to target commercial aviation and are,1596.394,2.236
aggressive in pursuing innovative methods to,1598.63,2.836
undertake their attacks to include smuggling an,1601.466,2.536
explosive device in various consumer objects.,1604.002,2.336
"Base on this information, the Secretary of Homeland",1606.338,2.168
Security and the TSA administrator determined,1608.506,2.77
that it&amp;#39;s necessary to enhance security,1611.276,2.335
procedures for passengers at certain,1613.611,1.569
last-point-of-departure airports.,1615.18,2.369
"That being said, I&amp;#39;m not going to go any further",1617.549,3.003
"than that, and I would refer any further",1620.552,1.334
comment to the TSA.,1621.886,1.936
The Press: Can I try what I was going to,1623.822,3.203
try out earlier then?,1627.025,1.268
Mark Meadows -- seems like a nice guy -- and the,1628.293,3.57
"President seemed like he was kind of joking, but",1631.863,1.702
has the President decided in his own mind yet,1633.565,2.202
whether he thinks it would be appropriate potentially,1635.767,4.271
"to mount primary opposition, to campaign",1640.038,3.203
for primary opposition in Republican,1643.241,2.669
congressional midterms?,1645.91,1.068
Mr. Spicer: Mark Meadows is a long-time early,1646.978,4.271
supporter of the President.,1651.249,2.136
He had some fun at his expense this morning,1653.385,2.669
"during the conference meeting, and I think he",1656.054,4.104
"continued to express hope that Congressman Meadows,",1660.158,3.07
"who&amp;#39;s the head of the Freedom Caucus, would",1663.228,3.303
continue to see the efforts that have been,1666.531,3.303
made to make this better and address a lot of the,1669.834,3.504
concerns out there.,1673.338,1.201
But he has made it very clear that he was having,1674.539,2.436
fun with him.,1676.975,0.7
The President is committed to making sure that this,1677.675,2.236
gets passed.,1679.911,0.667
We&amp;#39;ll go from there.,1680.578,1.068
Vivian.,1681.646,0.667
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1682.313,1.535
First a follow-up to Margaret&amp;#39;s question.,1683.848,2.102
Why wait for the new aviation regulations 96,1685.95,2.236
hours to implement it?,1688.186,1.635
Isn&amp;#39;t the President&amp;#39;s mantra on counterterrorism,1689.821,2.469
"that we have to kind of sneak up on our enemies,",1692.29,4.505
not let them know our tactics?,1696.795,2.435
Mr. Spicer: So I&amp;#39;m going to ultimately you refer,1699.23,3.304
"you back to TSA, but I will tell you that --",1702.534,1.535
remember that these are 10 airports of last point of,1704.069,3.77
departure to the United States out of,1707.839,2.536
250 that come here.,1710.375,1.535
Part of it is to allow -- you have to provide,1711.91,2.836
"appropriate notification to the host country, to",1714.746,2.436
"the host airlines, and give them opportunity",1717.182,2.602
to get those procedures in place.,1719.784,1.635
I&amp;#39;m not going to comment any further about the,1721.419,2.836
security measures that have been taking place or,1724.255,3.904
are taking place just to continue to refer,1728.159,2.069
you back to TSA.,1730.228,0.767
But I will tell you that I think that implementing,1730.995,2.503
something of this nature in that timeframe is,1733.498,2.97
pretty darn quick.,1736.468,0.667
"The Press: Okay, and one more -- sorry, I had a",1737.135,1.368
follow-up --,1738.503,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Of course.,1739.17,0.668
The Press: Sorry.,1739.838,0.667
Something totally unrelated.,1740.505,0.667
"I wanted to ask, has the White House Counsel",1741.172,1.535
approved Ivanka Trump getting a West Wing office,1742.707,1.902
and clearance?,1744.609,0.667
And so what is the administration&amp;#39;s thinking,1745.276,1.468
behind this?,1746.744,0.668
What is she going to do as the --,1747.412,1.935
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t think,1749.347,1.168
"the counsel actually approves office space, but",1750.515,2.069
I get your questions.,1752.584,1.001
The Press: Right.,1753.585,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Ivanka has taken on several measures,1754.252,1.869
to promote high standards of ethical conduct.,1756.121,2.302
"Even though she&amp;#39;s not a federal employee, she&amp;#39;ll",1758.423,1.668
follow the restrictions that would,1760.091,1.335
apply if she were.,1761.426,1.101
She&amp;#39;s taking these steps with advice of counsel and,1762.527,3.103
in consultation with the Office of,1765.63,1.335
Government Ethics.,1766.965,1.034
Hallie.,1767.999,0.667
The Press: Two for you.,1768.666,0.668
"One on healthcare, to follow up on the",1769.334,1.601
follow-ups.,1770.935,0.668
You&amp;#39;ve made very clear that the President was,1771.603,1.935
going to be supporting those who,1773.538,1.768
supported the bill.,1775.306,0.935
"And I want to talk about the flip side of that, but",1776.241,2.502
when he talked this morning in the closed-door,1778.743,1.802
"meeting about people paying a price, losing",1780.545,1.568
"seats, not get the majority -- is that an",1782.113,2.036
implied threat from the President to the members,1784.149,1.768
"that don&amp;#39;t back this bill Mr. Spicer: No, I think",1785.917,1.969
it&amp;#39;s a political reality.,1787.886,1.901
I think if you go out and promise the American,1789.787,2.403
"people something and your voters something,",1792.19,1.835
"especially on a scale like this -- and, frankly, as I",1794.025,2.102
"said, there&amp;#39;s obviously members that have been",1796.127,2.369
"there one term, two terms, three terms, but this is",1798.496,2.002
something that as a party we&amp;#39;ve made very clear --,1800.498,1.935
"if you give us this, American people, we",1802.433,2.369
will get this done.,1804.802,1.469
And I think that to go and make a promise and a,1806.271,2.702
pledge of this magnitude and not to follow it,1808.973,2.603
"through, I&amp;#39;m sure that voters would be upset.",1811.576,3.27
And we&amp;#39;ve seen this in the past.,1814.846,2.803
"And it&amp;#39;s something that I think the President, as I",1817.649,2.102
"mentioned earlier, has staked -- has earned high",1819.751,3.003
"marks for, is keeping his word.",1822.754,1.268
And I think the President was stating a political,1824.022,1.968
reality -- if we go out there and make these,1825.99,2.002
pledges to the American people and don&amp;#39;t do what,1827.992,2.403
"we&amp;#39;ve said we&amp;#39;ve done on these big things, then I",1830.395,2.369
don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re going to continue to want to see,1832.764,1.501
us in the majority and they&amp;#39;re going to look,1834.265,1.335
for an alternative.,1835.6,0.667
"The Press: And the second, just about -- will he",1836.267,2.269
remember the names of those who don&amp;#39;t,1838.536,1.835
back the bill?,1840.371,0.768
Mr. Spicer: (Laughter.) We&amp;#39;ll see.,1841.139,1.334
John Gizzi.,1842.473,0.668
"The Press: Actually, on yesterday, I just wanted",1843.141,1.868
to clarify that.,1845.009,0.901
Mr. Spicer: -- on counting -- it&amp;#39;s like CBO.,1845.91,2.736
(Laughter.) Sorry.,1848.646,0.668
"Come on, that was -- The Press: Do you want to",1849.314,3.27
elaborate on that one?,1852.584,1.201
"Mr. Spicer: No, I don&amp;#39;t.",1853.785,1.301
Please go ahead.,1855.086,0.667
The Press: I do want to ask about the Russia,1855.753,1.702
testimony from yesterday.,1857.455,0.701
I know you obviously addressed it from the,1858.156,1.334
"podium hours ago, but there was sort of this",1859.49,3.037
interesting moment that happened a little bit,1862.527,1.935
"after the briefing, where Director Comey was asked",1864.462,2.236
about the live tweets coming from the President,1866.698,2.235
in his account at the same time that the,1868.933,2.503
hearing was happening.,1871.436,0.867
And Director was fact-checking the,1872.303,1.368
"President in real time, essentially saying he was",1873.671,2.136
incorrect in what he was tweeting.,1875.807,2.102
Is there concern on the part of the White House,1877.909,1.635
about the President&amp;#39;s credibility in that,1879.544,1.802
"situation, that his own Director is correcting his",1881.346,2.402
tweets and what he&amp;#39;s saying in real time?,1883.748,2.436
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I mean, let&amp;#39;s just be clear.",1886.184,1.601
"I mean, he was answering questions.",1887.785,1.735
"I mean, it&amp;#39;s not like he was out there -- he was",1889.52,2.403
responding to a question.,1891.923,0.934
"But again, I think it&amp;#39;s important to note, with",1892.857,2.669
respect to this -- and I saw a couple comments,1895.526,3.571
yesterday -- Senator Coons took issue with a couple,1899.097,2.903
of the comments that we made.,1902,1.201
Let me just read you -- I know you guys love this,1903.201,1.868
"when I do this, so I&amp;#39;m just going to entertain",1905.069,1.502
you for a second -- Senator Chris Coons --,1906.571,1.835
"this is his quote, direct quote -- &amp;quot;I have no hard",1908.406,3.17
evidence of collusion.&amp;quot;,1911.576,1.835
"Director Clapper, &amp;quot;Not to my knowledge.&amp;quot;",1913.411,1.335
"Senator Tom Cotton, &amp;quot;Not that I&amp;#39;ve seen and not",1914.746,1.801
that I&amp;#39;m aware of.&amp;quot;,1916.547,2.269
This is in reference to any type of collusion with,1918.816,4.305
Russia that occurred.,1923.121,1.101
"Obama&amp;#39;s Acting CIA Director Morell, &amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s",1924.222,1.735
smoke but there&amp;#39;s no fire.&amp;quot;,1925.957,3.503
Senator Chuck Grassley after the Comey briefing,1929.46,2.002
"-- I can say #POTUS and #Clapper are both right,",1931.462,2.903
no evidence of Trump collusion with,1934.365,1.368
the Russians.,1935.733,0.668
So we&amp;#39;ve now gone over this on multiple,1936.401,3.87
"occasions, but at some point there is a",1940.271,1.802
distinction between an investigation that goes,1942.073,3.804
into Russia&amp;#39;s involvement in 2016 and this continued,1945.877,3.537
narrative that falsely tries to link the Trump --,1949.414,3.77
the President or the White House into any of it.,1953.184,1.969
They continue to see that there is nothing there.,1955.153,3.103
Every single person who has been briefed who has,1958.256,1.768
come out and publicly talked about it --,1960.024,2.136
"Republican, Democrat, former DNI, former CIA",1962.16,2.536
"directors, Obama appointees --",1964.696,2.102
have said no evidence.,1966.798,1.501
And so I get that -- we keep getting asked -- The,1968.299,4.038
Press: That&amp;#39;s not my question.,1972.337,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: But my point is, is that -- that was",1973.004,1.335
"one of the tweets, though, that he addressed.",1974.339,2.302
"He said, former DNI continues to note -- and",1976.641,3.37
that was actually true.,1980.011,0.934
These are their quotes.,1980.945,1.268
This is what they&amp;#39;ve said.,1982.213,1.835
So it&amp;#39;s not a question -- I think sometimes you come,1984.048,2.236
"back to us -- at some point, the question has to",1986.284,2.002
be to the individuals who said this -- whether it&amp;#39;s,1988.286,2.035
"Chris Coons from Delaware, or former Director",1990.321,2.536
"Clapper, or former CIA Acting Director Morell --",1992.857,2.569
they&amp;#39;re the ones who&amp;#39;ve said these,1995.426,1.335
things on the record.,1996.761,0.667
They&amp;#39;re the ones who&amp;#39;ve been briefed by the,1997.428,1.335
"intelligence community, by the FBI, and come out and",1998.763,3.503
said there is no collusion.,2002.266,2.803
"And so, at some point, to fact-check the President",2005.069,3.871
for merely quoting them is not -- the question should,2008.94,3.804
"be directed at them, not us.",2012.744,1.034
"But over and over again, it&amp;#39;s come to the",2013.778,1.835
same conclusion.,2015.613,0.801
"So, Kaitlan.",2016.414,0.667
"All right, John.",2017.081,0.668
Then Kaitlan.,2017.749,0.667
That was very nice of you.,2018.416,4.604
It&amp;#39;s National Ag Day afterwards -- The Press:,2023.02,5.606
"Thank you, Sean.",2028.626,0.768
"Thank you, Kaitlan.",2029.394,1.468
I have two questions.,2030.862,3.403
"First, the author David Horowitz, in his book, The",2034.265,3.17
"Big Agenda, writes of what he calls &amp;quot;a deep state,&amp;quot;",2037.435,5.772
in which he said these are Obama holdovers in,2043.207,3.704
government who are trying to undercut the,2046.911,2.903
President&amp;#39;s agenda.,2049.814,0.801
This has been widely repeated on social media.,2050.615,3.069
Does the President himself believe in,2053.684,3.37
this deep state?,2057.054,1.669
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I&amp;#39;ve been asked this question",2058.723,3.303
before and I&amp;#39;ll give you the same answer I&amp;#39;ve given,2062.026,2.035
"before, which is I think there are people that",2064.061,2.036
burrow into the government after an administration --,2066.097,2.336
this is going back since the beginning of time.,2068.433,2.769
They used to call it ramspecking -- it&amp;#39;s,2071.202,2.336
suddenly no longer permitted in terms,2073.538,2.736
of that same way.,2076.274,0.7
But this has been going on since the country was --,2076.974,2.77
"country came to be, where people burrow in after an",2079.744,2.803
administration into a civil servant job.,2082.547,3.904
"But, sure, there&amp;#39;s people, after eight years of Obama",2086.451,2.035
"that found their way into government, so it",2088.486,2.269
should be no huge secret.,2090.755,1.134
Okay?,2091.889,0.668
The Press: Yes.,2092.557,0.734
Another question on --,2093.291,1.368
The Press: What was that again?,2094.659,2.068
The Press: -- that word?,2096.727,1.736
Mr. Spicer: Ramspecking?,2098.463,1.034
"Oh, Google it.",2099.497,1.068
The Press: I remember -- I remember when -- The,2100.565,2.802
Press: How do you spell it?,2103.367,1.969
Mr. Spicer: You ever seen my spelling?,2105.336,1.335
Come on.,2106.671,0.667
(Laughter.) Ramspecking.,2107.338,0.667
It was named after -- we&amp;#39;re going to go through,2108.005,1.335
"a history lesson here, guys.",2109.34,1.168
"The Press: My other question was, over the",2110.508,4.404
"weekend, Governor Graco Ramirez, the head of the",2114.912,4.371
"Mexican Governors Association, was again in",2119.283,3.304
"Washington, and in a much publicized statement said",2122.587,4.404
that Mexico had scored its first victory over,2126.991,4.338
the proposed wall.,2131.329,1.334
He said that in the President&amp;#39;s budget there&amp;#39;s,2132.663,3.103
a line item for $2.6 billion --,2135.766,2.703
Mr. Spicer: In FY&amp;#39;18.,2138.469,1.468
"The Press: -- in tax dollars, and no mention of",2139.937,3.671
Mexico paying for the wall in any way.,2143.608,2.802
He&amp;#39;s claimed a victory in that.,2146.41,1.869
Your response to Governor Graco Ramirez?,2148.279,1.902
Mr. Spicer: It&amp;#39;s a little early to be,2150.181,1.535
claiming victory.,2151.716,0.767
I think the President has made it clear that he was,2152.483,2.536
going to use the current process to start the,2155.019,4.238
construction of the wall and that there would be,2159.257,4.237
ways that that fulfillment of that pledge,2163.494,1.869
would come true.,2165.363,0.867
Kaitlan.,2166.23,0.668
The Press: Thank you.,2166.898,0.667
The administration and the President have repeatedly,2167.565,1.802
said that over the next few weeks they will,2169.367,2.135
present evidence that he was wiretapped.,2171.502,1.802
And last week he said it would be coming this week,2173.304,2.469
and he may speak on it this week.,2175.773,1.802
"Can we expect the President to, this week,",2177.575,2.102
present evidence that he was wiretapped,2179.677,2.169
by Barack Obama?,2181.846,1.101
Or will he speak about it?,2182.947,1.101
Because he didn&amp;#39;t mention it last night,2184.048,1.335
in his rally.,2185.383,0.901
Mr. Spicer: Let&amp;#39;s see how the week goes.,2186.284,2.369
Margaret.,2188.653,0.667
"The Press: Sean, when we heard from the President",2189.32,2.302
before talk about the need for this healthcare plan,2191.622,2.703
"to pass, he&amp;#39;s talked about the important steps of tax",2194.325,2.97
reform and the rest.,2197.295,1.167
At what point do you think that his agenda could be,2198.462,3.27
imperiled as you look at the vote count?,2201.732,2.403
"Because you&amp;#39;re also going to have a further fight,",2204.135,2.669
"of course, to get any of this through the Senate.",2206.804,2.97
"Mr. Spicer: So, at what point will the vote count --",2209.774,3.27
The Press: This seems to be such a centerpiece,2213.044,2.402
of the rest of the President&amp;#39;s agenda.,2215.446,2.369
So given that it&amp;#39;s still not any -- there&amp;#39;s no,2217.815,4.438
"certainty in terms of passage at this point, how",2222.253,3.67
concerned are you that Thursday could imperil the,2225.923,3.27
President&amp;#39;s agenda?,2229.193,0.801
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think it&amp;#39;s -- the President&amp;#39;s",2229.994,3.17
visit this morning was very well received.,2233.164,2.135
I think we continue down the path to get the votes.,2235.299,2.202
We got a ways to go.,2237.501,0.734
We got to get to the Senate next.,2238.235,1.669
But I think members understand that this is,2239.904,2.235
something that has been at the heart of what,2242.139,3.337
"Republicans have campaigned, and I feel we",2245.476,1.969
-- I feel very good headed into this.,2247.445,3.203
"The President continues to talk to members, and we&amp;#39;re",2250.648,1.602
going to make sure that we grow the vote as,2252.25,1.334
much as we can.,2253.584,1.301
"But with respect to the rest of the agenda, I",2254.885,3.204
think all of the issues that the President,2258.089,1.801
campaigned on are things that the House and the,2259.89,2.169
Senate both look forward to taking up.,2262.059,2.57
Whether it&amp;#39;s trade or immigration or,2264.629,2.068
"comprehensive tax reform, all of these issues are",2266.697,2.569
stuff that many Republicans have,2269.266,2.103
campaigned on for a long time and are,2271.369,1.368
eager to get going.,2272.737,1.234
"The President has made it very clear, as he did last",2273.971,1.869
"night, as well, that, look, part of the -- we&amp;#39;ve",2275.84,2.269
got to keep moving along if we want to,2278.109,1.601
get big things done.,2279.71,2.503
There&amp;#39;s a lot that can be done during this,2282.213,1.535
"administration, during the first term, and he wants",2283.748,2.502
to get as much of it done as possible.,2286.25,1.435
"And so the quicker we get repeal and replace done,",2287.685,3.136
"and put the American Health Care Act in place,",2290.821,3.27
the better.,2294.091,0.668
I mean that&amp;#39;s just the nature of it.,2294.759,2.202
But I think when you look at the speed in which,2296.961,2.302
"we&amp;#39;ve moved, it&amp;#39;s been very responsible.",2299.263,2.336
We&amp;#39;ve allowed the committees to,2301.599,1.368
work their will.,2302.967,0.934
The House has taken up the amendments.,2303.901,3.804
It&amp;#39;s been online.,2307.705,1.168
So this is -- there&amp;#39;s always a balance between,2308.873,3.303
jamming it down and getting it done and over,2312.176,1.768
"with, which is how the Democrats operated at one",2313.944,2.236
point when they finally moved on their bill versus,2316.18,3.303
how this is done.,2319.483,0.668
But I think we&amp;#39;ve stricken a very nice,2320.151,1.801
balance on this.,2321.952,0.835
The Press: At which point will be it Trumpcare?,2322.787,1.701
The President said today it could happen when we,2324.488,2.57
asked during the photo spray.,2327.058,1.501
Mr. Spicer: We&amp;#39;ll have to see.,2328.559,1.869
"Right now it&amp;#39;s the American Health Care Act,",2330.428,1.901
and we&amp;#39;re trying to get it done.,2332.329,1.335
Anita.,2333.664,0.667
The Press: Two questions.,2334.331,1.135
"First, the Kansas legislature is on the",2335.466,1.435
"verge of possibly passing a Medicaid expansion, and",2336.901,2.502
the current version of the healthcare bill does not,2339.403,2.87
allow states to pass that.,2342.273,1.701
And so I&amp;#39;m wondering -- as you know most legislatures,2343.974,2.77
are currently meeting across the country.,2346.744,1.568
Will there be an exception for states if they expand,2348.312,2.603
before any new bill comes to --,2350.915,1.835
Mr. Spicer: It would have to be addressed in the legislation.,2352.75,2.869
"I don&amp;#39;t believe there&amp;#39;s an exception clause, so I",2355.619,2.436
don&amp;#39;t -- but I also don&amp;#39;t -- it would be -- far be,2358.055,2.87
"it from me to say at this point, the bill is getting",2360.925,2.002
"ready to move to the House, the",2362.927,1.301
legislation is meeting.,2364.228,0.868
I don&amp;#39;t want to prejudge the outcome yet.,2365.096,2.435
But I don&amp;#39;t believe from my understanding that,2367.531,2.503
there is any kind of like clause that says &amp;quot;if.&amp;quot;,2370.034,1.868
"The Press: And secondly, tomorrow -- you mentioned",2371.902,2.469
the Congressional Black Caucus.,2374.371,1.168
"Is there a specific topic -- healthcare,",2375.539,2.436
five topics?,2377.975,0.667
What can you tell us about the President&amp;#39;s message,2378.642,3.137
to them?,2381.779,0.701
And how did it come about?,2382.48,1.601
I know there&amp;#39;s been some back and forth on getting,2384.081,2.803
"a meeting going, how did that come about?",2386.884,2.436
"Mr. Spicer: (Laughter.) April is -- okay, don&amp;#39;t",2389.32,3.77
drag April into that.,2393.09,1.068
(Laughter.),2394.158,0.667
"The Press: Didn&amp;#39;t say a name, didn&amp;#39;t",2394.825,1.368
say a name.,2396.193,0.768
Mr. Spicer: This has been something that the,2396.961,2.068
President has talked about for a while.,2399.029,1.802
He met with Congressman Elijah Cummings.,2400.831,1.769
He started off in a phone call probably a month or,2402.6,3.203
so ago where they discussed prescription,2405.803,1.802
drugs and the need to get it down; and then the,2407.605,2.369
conversation continued.,2409.974,0.934
Our legislation affairs team early on went to some,2410.908,4.638
of their meetings and started having a dialogue,2415.546,2.002
"with them, and that dialogue continued.",2417.548,3.737
And there was a desire to have a meeting.,2421.285,1.502
The President wanted to have them down.,2422.787,1.668
I think there&amp;#39;s going to be a range of issues that,2424.455,1.401
get discussed that range from drug prices to,2425.856,4.271
"infrastructure, investment in education, HBCUs.",2430.127,3.37
"There will be a range, and I think that&amp;#39;s part of it.",2433.497,4.505
There&amp;#39;s no set agenda to say we must talk,2438.002,2.402
about these things.,2440.404,0.667
"And obviously, I think healthcare is going to",2441.071,1.335
"come up, too.",2442.406,0.667
The President wants to get their idea.,2443.073,1.569
"Before April jumps out her seat, we&amp;#39;ll give her --",2444.642,3.203
The Press: Thank you for giving a follow-up.,2447.845,3.003
"I want to follow up on the CBC, and I have another",2450.848,4.504
question on another subject.,2455.352,1.502
"So with the CBC, since you&amp;#39;re saying you went",2456.854,3.036
through all of this prior to the fact that he became,2459.89,2.97
"President, that there was an effort to reach",2462.86,2.269
out to the CBC.,2465.129,1.168
So with all of this understanding that they,2466.297,2.369
are an important to deal with in handling some of,2468.666,3.036
"the issues, the urban issues, or issues that",2471.702,2.469
"pertain to their community, how does the",2474.171,2.136
President plan to move forward in working with,2476.307,2.469
"them, particularly as some just don&amp;#39;t see",2478.776,1.968
eye-to-eye with him?,2480.744,1.035
Mr. Spicer: I think part of it is it continues to,2481.779,4.871
"have a dialogue, April.",2486.65,1.101
"I mean, it&amp;#39;s simply sitting down with people,",2487.751,2.937
"talking about issues,",2490.688,1.168
talking about common ground.,2491.856,0.967
I think if you look at the conversation that he began,2492.823,2.469
and continued with Congressman Elijah,2495.292,1.569
"Cummings, they found common ground.",2496.861,2.469
"The President talked about areas where, despite some",2499.33,3.336
"of the narratives that are out there, there were",2502.666,1.969
issues that they probably both share concern for and,2504.635,3.27
that they can work on together.,2507.905,2.069
And maybe they won&amp;#39;t agree on 100 percent or 60,2509.974,2.903
"percent, but maybe there&amp;#39;s 15, 20, or 30",2512.877,2.035
percent of the issues.,2514.912,1.001
Maybe there&amp;#39;s one bill in particular that,2515.913,1.702
they can work on.,2517.615,0.767
"But there&amp;#39;s a willingness to sit down and talk, and",2518.382,3.737
I think that&amp;#39;s the first step in the process,2522.119,1.902
of any of these.,2524.021,1.368
It&amp;#39;s not just your own party -- and the President,2525.389,2.236
has shown this on several of these meetings -- where,2527.625,2.936
it&amp;#39;s not just business leaders.,2530.561,1.101
He&amp;#39;s brought in the union leaders.,2531.662,1.335
"We talked about healthcare; yesterday, he",2532.997,1.334
had Dr. Zeke Emanuel in.,2534.331,1.502
It&amp;#39;s not about just bringing in people who,2535.833,1.601
"agree with you, it&amp;#39;s about people across the spectrum",2537.434,2.67
who can offer ideas.,2540.104,1.334
And the President -- and I get it that inner cities,2541.438,3.337
"aren&amp;#39;t exclusive, the rebuilding of inner cities",2544.775,1.935
aren&amp;#39;t the only issue.,2546.71,1.068
But he&amp;#39;s talked about -- he&amp;#39;s elevated the status,2547.778,3.036
"of Historically Black Colleges and Universities,",2550.814,1.502
bringing that office into the White House to help,2552.316,1.835
coordinate some of the federal,2554.151,1.301
government activities.,2555.452,0.701
He&amp;#39;s talked about rebuilding the,2556.153,1.368
inner cities.,2557.521,0.667
He&amp;#39;s talked about school choice.,2558.188,1.335
A lot of issues that --,2559.523,1.068
The Press: Law and order.,2560.591,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Law and order, and healthcare.",2561.258,1.468
"And there&amp;#39;s issues that impact urban areas,",2562.726,3.037
"minority communities, whether they live in rural",2565.763,3.57
areas or urban areas.,2569.333,0.767
But I think that that dialogue needs to continue,2570.1,2.436
"because it can only help, and I think that that&amp;#39;s",2572.536,2.936
what we look forward to tomorrow.,2575.472,1.335
The Press: And the second subject -- as you&amp;#39;re,2576.807,1.335
"talking about bringing in groups, you&amp;#39;re also",2578.142,1.902
bringing in truckers.,2580.044,0.967
And there is a concern in the trucking industry,2581.011,2.903
about something like e-logs that&amp;#39;s going to,2583.914,2.269
"happen at the end of the year, where truckers -- be",2586.183,3.57
"it truckers with commercial trucks, or",2589.753,2.069
mom-and-pop businesses -- all of them are going to,2591.822,1.835
"have computers to log in, to monitor the time you",2593.657,3.704
"drive, the stop and speed, et cetera.",2597.361,2.502
And many people are saying that it cuts,2599.863,2.57
into their income.,2602.433,0.967
Where does the President stand on that?,2603.4,2.269
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, I think let&amp;#39;s see if that comes up",2605.669,2.836
"in the meeting, and I&amp;#39;ll have a readout.",2608.505,1.368
But I know --,2609.873,0.668
The Press: But even whether it comes up in the meeting --,2610.541,1.334
Mr. Spicer: I understand. That&amp;#39;s,2611.875,1.335
"more of a DOT issue, so I would refer",2613.21,1.335
you to the Department of Transportation.,2614.545,1.334
The Press: They&amp;#39;re very concerned about it.,2615.879,1.335
Would he at least --,2617.214,0.701
Mr. Spicer: I understand that.,2617.915,0.901
And I hope that that comes up.,2618.816,2.102
Jeff Mason.,2620.918,0.667
The Press: Just a follow-up on the DHS,2621.585,3.67
airline issue.,2625.255,1.035
If there is a danger to Americans or to fliers,2626.29,3.537
generally with having laptops or things that are,2629.827,3.703
bigger than a cellphone in planes from those 10,2633.53,4.171
"countries, why would that also not be a danger from",2637.701,4.638
other countries?,2642.339,0.934
"Mr. Spicer: As you can imagine, I can&amp;#39;t talk",2643.273,4.205
about the intelligence that we have.,2647.478,1.768
I can just tell you that the steps that are being,2649.246,1.368
taken are appropriate and commensurate with the,2650.614,1.335
intelligence that we have.,2651.949,0.667
And I&amp;#39;d refer you to the Department of Homeland,2652.616,1.335
"Security and, specifically, the",2653.951,0.667
Transportation Security Administration.,2654.618,1.335
The Press: One other question.,2655.953,1.435
Mr. Spicer: One out of two.,2657.388,1.935
The Press: Okay.,2659.323,1.001
The President has traditionally issued a,2660.324,1.968
greeting to those celebrating the Iranian,2662.292,1.969
"New Year, Nowruz.",2664.261,0.968
Will President Trump be doing that today?,2665.229,2.302
Mr. Spicer: Let me get back to you.,2667.531,1.735
I know that -- I don&amp;#39;t want to get ahead of,2669.266,2.102
"myself on that, but we may have something",2671.368,2.636
for you later.,2674.004,0.667
I&amp;#39;ve got to check on that.,2674.671,1.769
"But thank you, guys, very much.",2676.44,1.234
Let&amp;#39;s get back to watching Neil Gorsuch.,2677.674,1.502
And I will see you tomorrow.,2679.176,1.635
We&amp;#39;re going to have a week full of briefings.,2680.811,2.402
I&amp;#39;m excited.,2683.213,0.601
"And, by the way, I am very happy that the individual",2683.814,2.369
in the press corps who took Tom Brady&amp;#39;s jersey --,2686.183,2.97
(laughter) -- that that has been,2689.153,1.835
returned properly.,2690.988,1.301
"Another bad on the press,",2692.289,1.201
but we have righted that wrong.,2693.49,1.569
Thank you.,2695.059,0.633
