Mr. Spicer: Good afternoon.,0.767,2.669
"First, at the top, I wanted to note that the",3.436,1.702
President has been briefed on the situation in London.,5.138,4.404
"He just spoke to Prime Minister May, and we&amp;#39;ll",9.542,1.802
have a readout on that situation and that call soon.,11.344,3.237
We obviously condemn today&amp;#39;s attack in,14.581,2.636
"Westminster, which the United Kingdom is treating",17.217,2.903
as an act of terrorism.,20.12,1.768
And we applaud the quick response that the British,21.888,3.403
police and their first responders made,25.291,2.403
to the situation.,27.694,1.001
The victims in this are in our thoughts,28.695,2.469
and our prayers.,31.164,1.902
The City of London and Her Majesty&amp;#39;s government have,33.066,3.136
the full support of the U.S.,36.202,1.402
government in responding to the attack and bringing,37.604,2.536
those to justice who are responsible.,40.14,1.935
We will provide you with further updates as,42.075,2.336
"warranted and, as I mentioned, a readout of",44.411,2.035
the President&amp;#39;s call with the Prime Minister.,46.446,2.569
"Turning to the events of today -- this morning, the",49.015,3.237
President received his daily intelligence briefing.,52.252,2.502
He stopped by the Women in Healthcare panel hosted by,54.754,2.87
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Systems,57.624,2.202
"Administrator, Seema Verma.",59.826,1.602
"And also, that event was attended by the Vice",61.428,2.736
President and the Health and Human Services,64.164,1.968
"Secretary, Dr. Tom Price.",66.132,1.835
Healthcare professionals have seen the challenges,67.967,1.969
of implementing Obamacare firsthand.,69.936,2.669
They&amp;#39;re a valuable asset to the President and his,72.605,2.069
team as we continue to consider and enact,74.674,2.469
"policies, like the American Health Care Act,",77.143,1.802
that will make healthcare more accessible and,78.945,2.536
affordable for everyone.,81.481,1.635
The women who were at the roundtable today represent,83.116,2.002
"the physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and",85.118,2.536
administrators who make sure that people around,87.654,2.769
the country receive the necessary preventative and,90.423,2.636
lifesaving care that they need every day.,93.059,2.202
The doctors who attend to the patients in the family,95.261,2.836
"practices, emergency rooms, and clinics -- and",98.097,3.17
those who support them on the administrative and,101.267,2.203
technical sides -- are one of our country&amp;#39;s,103.47,2.335
most treasured resources.,105.805,2.169
With the passage of the American Health Care Act,107.974,2.469
and the rest of the President&amp;#39;s healthcare,110.443,1.502
"reform agenda, everyone, regardless of their",111.945,2.569
"financial situation, will be able to take full",114.514,2.436
advantage of this resource.,116.95,1.668
"That&amp;#39;s why, at last count, over 40 major associations",118.618,3.27
have expressed their support for the American,121.888,1.735
"Health Care Act, with several of them,",123.623,2.169
including the U.S.,125.792,0.667
"Chamber [of Commerce], the National Federation of",126.459,1.502
"Independent Businesses, and, just today, the",127.961,2.135
National Taxpayers Union calling it a key vote.,130.096,3.404
"Following his appearance at the panel, the",133.5,1.768
President and his legislative affairs team,135.268,2.336
hosted several members of the House of,137.604,1.434
Representatives for another meeting on the,139.038,1.969
American Health Care Act.,141.007,1.502
"The President acknowledged, as he has",142.509,1.668
"before, that the AHCA is only one step in the",144.177,3.337
larger process of fixing the broken healthcare,147.514,2.202
"system created by Obamacare, but it&amp;#39;s an",149.716,2.936
essential first step.,152.652,1.835
Undoing and fixing all of the misguided policies is,154.487,2.503
"going to require a holistic, multistep process.",156.99,3.637
And that&amp;#39;s why the President and his team are,160.627,2.068
fully committed to maintaining an open line,162.695,1.836
of communication with Capitol Hill leadership,164.531,3.336
throughout this entire process.,167.867,1.869
Throughout the weeks since the AHCA was first,169.736,2.435
"introduced, they have been meeting with Republican",172.171,2.169
"members from across the political spectrum, many",174.34,2.403
"of whom we&amp;#39;ve seen move from &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;yes,&amp;quot; as",176.743,2.769
they learn more about the legislation and amendments,179.512,2.469
that have been adopted.,181.981,1.435
Continued coordination between administrative and,183.416,3.303
legislative actions will ensure that our new,186.719,2.236
healthcare system is effective and efficient.,188.955,2.869
"This afternoon, the President will meet with",191.824,1.535
the Congressional Black Caucus&amp;#39;s Executive Committee.,193.359,2.77
The President has brought in and will continue to,196.129,1.835
hear from representatives of all interests as he,197.964,2.302
continues to note that he is the President,200.266,1.568
of all Americans.,201.834,1.435
"Diversity makes our nation strong, and it also means",203.269,3.17
that we don&amp;#39;t necessarily agree on every policy item,206.439,3.337
but that we continue to have a dialogue towards,209.776,2.402
productive policies that help America move forward.,212.178,3.504
The President looks forward to discussing the,215.682,1.601
CBC&amp;#39;s policy priorities and finding ways that they,217.283,3.037
can work together where those priorities align.,220.32,2.569
"This evening, the President will have dinner",222.889,1.501
with Secretary of State Tillerson.,224.39,1.936
"Today at the State Department, Secretary",226.326,1.935
Tillerson hosted the foreign ministers and,228.261,1.902
senior leaders of the Global Coalition working,230.163,3.103
to defeat ISIS for the first meeting of the full,233.266,1.968
coalition of 68 members since December 2014.,235.234,4.004
This meeting follows up on the defense ministerial,239.238,2.169
Secretary Mattis hosted last month in Brussels.,241.407,2.903
"The coalition is united in the fight against ISIS,",244.31,2.703
and this meeting seeks to accelerate international,247.013,2.269
efforts to defeat ISIS in the remaining areas it,249.282,2.803
"holds in Iraq and Syria, while maximizing pressure",252.085,3.203
"on its branches, affiliates, and networks.",255.288,3.303
This meeting is a part of our whole-of-government,258.591,1.935
approach to defeating ISIS.,260.526,1.869
The Trump administration will use all of the tools,262.395,2.169
"of national power, in coordination with our",264.564,2.302
"international powers [partners], to cut off",266.866,2.035
"ISIS&amp;#39;s funding, expand intelligence sharing, and",268.901,3.404
deny ISIS geographic and online safe havens.,272.305,4.004
"Also today, over on the Hill, Judge Gorsuch [is]",276.309,2.135
in his second day of questioning by the,278.444,2.436
Senate Judiciary Committee.,280.88,1.769
During his nearly 12 hours of questioning yesterday,282.649,3.803
-- now at least I know how someone else feels --,286.452,1.101
(laughter),287.553,1.702
-- the judge continued to prove himself,289.255,2.035
an enormously qualified jurist that Americans will,291.29,2.87
all be proud to see on the Supreme Court.,294.16,2.469
It&amp;#39;s not surprising that Senate Democrats are,296.629,1.869
failing to gain traction for any of their potshots,298.498,3.737
and opposition to Judge Gorsuch.,302.235,2.135
There&amp;#39;s simply not enough politicizing the Senate,304.37,2.236
Democrats can do to hide the fact that Judge,306.606,1.735
Gorsuch is an immensely qualified and thoughtful,308.341,3.17
jurist with a lifelong dedication to,311.511,2.302
our Constitution.,313.813,2.302
A few administrative notes here before I take your,316.115,1.635
"questions: Last night, we formally announced that",317.75,2.736
the President will travel to Brussels for the May,320.486,2.436
25th meeting of NATO heads of state and government.,322.922,3.637
"During this meeting, the President looks forward to",326.559,1.568
reaffirming our strong commitment to NATO and,328.127,2.069
"discussing critical issues to the Alliance,",330.196,2.336
especially Allied responsibility-sharing and,332.532,3.17
NATO&amp;#39;s role against -- the fight against terrorism.,335.702,2.535
The President will also host NATO Secretary,338.237,2.036
General Stoltenberg to the White House on April 12th.,340.273,3.47
"Today, the President declared a major disaster",343.743,3.87
exists in the state of Wyoming and ordered,347.613,2.536
"federal assistance to supplement state, tribal,",350.149,2.403
and local recovery efforts in the areas affected by a,352.552,2.769
severe winter storm and straight-line winds that,355.321,2.503
occurred in February.,357.824,1.835
We also announced that the President will deliver,359.659,1.735
this year&amp;#39;s commencement address at Liberty,361.394,1.568
University on May 13th.,362.962,2.302
"The President is proud to call Liberty&amp;#39;s president,",365.264,2.136
"Jerry Falwell, his wife Becki and their entire",367.4,1.935
"family, his friends, and looks forward to",369.335,2.336
celebrating the success of this amazing graduating,371.671,3.07
class on such a momentous occasion.,374.741,2.268
"Finally, a few minutes ago, many of you may have",377.009,2.269
seen that the Chairman of the House Intelligence,379.278,2.269
"Committee, Devin Nunes, gave remarks on the",381.547,2.403
surveillance collected on individuals associated,383.95,2.302
with the President.,386.252,0.667
Let me quote him directly: &amp;quot;I recently confirmed that,386.919,4.205
on numerous occasions the intelligence community,391.124,2.869
incidentally collected information about U.S.,393.993,2.136
citizens involved in the Trump transition.,396.129,3.236
Details about U.S.,399.365,0.934
persons associated with the incoming,400.299,1.702
"administration, details with little or no apparent",402.001,3.337
"foreign intelligence value, were widely",405.338,2.769
disseminated in the intelligence,408.107,1.568
community reporting.,409.675,1.669
"And third, I have confirmed that additional",411.344,2.469
names of Trump transition team members,413.813,2.569
were unmasked.,416.382,1.268
"And fourth and finally, I want to be clear, none of",417.65,2.636
this surveillance was related to Russia or the,420.286,2.069
investigation of Russian activities or [of],422.355,2.469
the Trump team.&amp;quot;,424.824,1.535
My understanding is that Chairman Nunes is coming,426.359,1.868
to the White House later to brief the President on,428.227,1.769
"this development, and we will have a readout",429.996,2.702
for that meeting once it occurs.,432.698,2.536
"With that, I&amp;#39;ll be glad to take your questions.",435.234,2.136
Mara.,437.37,0.667
The Press: Two questions.,438.037,1.735
One on Nunes and then healthcare.,439.772,1.735
Is your understanding that this -- none of these,441.507,2.803
unmasked names were leaked?,444.31,1.168
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know.,445.478,1.101
I literally read the statement -- or heard the,446.579,2.536
"statement, came out and briefed it.",449.115,1.568
It was wrapping up as we were beginning this.,450.683,2.269
The Press: Okay.,452.952,0.667
"Today in the pool spray, the President said &amp;quot;keep",453.619,3.604
"your doctor, keep your plan&amp;quot; didn&amp;#39;t work",457.223,1.335
out that way.,458.558,0.667
You didn&amp;#39;t get your doctor.,459.225,0.801
You don&amp;#39;t get your plan.,460.026,1.334
This is one of the reasons we have to,461.36,2.87
repeal Obamacare.,464.23,0.667
Is the President assuring people who currently like,464.897,2.469
their plan or like their doctor that under the,467.366,2.002
American Health Care Act they can keep their,469.368,1.735
doctor and their plan?,471.103,1.035
"Mr. Spicer: Well, that&amp;#39;s the hope.",472.138,1.334
"And what I mean by that is not to be cute, but last",473.472,2.002
time they were promised,475.474,0.701
something that didn&amp;#39;t turn out.,476.175,1.168
I can&amp;#39;t promise something that a doctor stays in a,477.343,2.436
plan or a plan stays there.,479.779,1.301
But that&amp;#39;s a bit different.,481.08,1.835
We understand that we&amp;#39;re letting market forces,482.915,2.369
come into play here.,485.284,2.469
Competition.,487.753,0.668
Doctors can change what insurances they take.,488.421,3.47
Plans can come in and out of markets.,491.891,1.802
What I think we can be assured of is,493.693,1.501
a couple of things.,495.194,0.701
"One is that currently under Obamacare, premiums",495.895,5.238
are set to continue to skyrocket.,501.133,1.435
We&amp;#39;ve seen an average of 25 percent.,502.568,2.136
"We&amp;#39;ve noted before in Arizona, they&amp;#39;ve gone",504.704,1.601
up 116 percent.,506.305,1.702
I think there&amp;#39;s no question that the,508.007,2.069
additional competition and amendments that have been,510.076,4.337
brought into this discussion will help lower,514.413,2.203
"the trajectory of that, number one.",516.616,2.168
Number two is I think that they&amp;#39;re going to,518.784,1.335
see greater choice.,520.119,1.869
So I think those are the things that we&amp;#39;re willing,521.988,1.868
to talk about being part of this plan because you,523.856,3.871
can&amp;#39;t -- where they erred last time is went out and,527.727,2.669
made promises that they couldn&amp;#39;t keep.,530.396,1.768
And I think that one of the problems that they did,532.164,2.236
is that they&amp;#39;ve tried to suppress market,534.4,3.57
forces and competition.,537.97,1.201
And instead of lowering costs and increasing,539.171,2.937
"choice, which is what they sought to do,",542.108,1.535
it did the opposite.,543.643,1.635
"So that&amp;#39;s where this is headed, and I think",545.278,2.235
that&amp;#39;s important.,547.513,0.667
John.,548.18,0.668
"The Press: Thanks a lot, Sean.",548.848,2.169
"On the AHCA, Mark Meadows, who appears to be a firm",551.017,4.704
no in terms of his opposition to the,555.721,3.437
"replacement bill, said that 25 members of the",559.158,3.403
Freedom Caucus are opposed to this replacement bill.,562.561,3.437
Do you dispute those numbers?,565.998,2.136
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to share our whip count.,568.134,2.169
"I know we saw Lou Barletta, who was a hard",570.303,1.868
"no, come out and say he&amp;#39;s yes.",572.171,1.702
Steve King I believe had been a no; he&amp;#39;s a yes.,573.873,4.171
Member by member we&amp;#39;re seeing tremendous support,578.044,2.669
"flow in our direction, and the count keeps",580.713,1.702
getting stronger for us.,582.415,2.569
So I&amp;#39;m not going to start to get into yes or nos.,584.984,3.603
But I would just say that former Congressman,588.587,2.236
"Mulvaney, now Director of OMB Mulvaney, who is a",590.823,4.238
"leader in that caucus, has been a very strong",595.061,3.603
advocate of this policy.,598.664,1.268
"As you know, he&amp;#39;s been up on the Hill talking to his",599.932,2.036
"former colleagues, assuring them of the",601.968,2.836
effort and why the process has to go the way it does.,604.804,4.237
But I&amp;#39;m optimistic in the sense of what we&amp;#39;re seeing,609.041,4.204
"and the trajectory that this is going, and the",613.245,1.736
"number of votes that are flowing our way,",614.981,1.868
not the other way.,616.849,0.667
The Press: And on the confirmation hearing for,617.516,2.303
"Judge Neil Gorsuch, I have not seen any Democrat come",619.819,3.003
out in support of Judge Gorsuch just yet.,622.822,2.536
Do you anticipate that you&amp;#39;ll get Democratic,625.358,2.035
support on this particular nomination?,627.393,2.135
Mr. Spicer: I hope and believe so.,629.528,2.87
I think that there have been several that have,632.398,1.401
been spoken very positively.,633.799,1.869
I think he&amp;#39;s been extremely impressive,635.668,1.568
"throughout this confirmation process, and",637.236,2.669
"you&amp;#39;ve heard members both in the Senate, on the",639.905,4.538
"committee, and then a lot of outside voices comment",644.443,3.37
"on how well he&amp;#39;s done, how qualified he is.",647.813,2.336
And I think it&amp;#39;s tough for anybody to say that he&amp;#39;s,650.149,3.737
not immensely qualified for this position.,653.886,4.138
Alexis.,658.024,0.667
"The Press: Sean, related to Congressman Nunes, can",658.691,2.436
you explain why the White House has agreed to meet,661.127,3.403
with him at all about what his findings are?,664.53,3.07
And the reason I ask that is because the minute that,667.6,3.77
Director Comey said that there was an official,671.37,2.736
"investigate, it might appear as if the White",674.106,2.036
House is interfering with the investigation.,676.142,1.935
And Congressman Nunes should present his,678.077,1.969
information not to the White House but to the FBI.,680.046,3.303
So why is anyone here at the White House agreeing,683.349,3.27
to meet with him about his findings?,686.619,2.269
Mr. Spicer: We&amp;#39;ll have a readout for you,688.888,1.701
after that meeting.,690.589,0.668
I think he did this press conference.,691.257,2.469
He made the announcement that he was coming up to,693.726,1.635
see the President to share these findings.,695.361,1.768
I don&amp;#39;t know who else he&amp;#39;s shared them with.,697.129,1.902
"I don&amp;#39;t know -- to your question, I don&amp;#39;t know if",699.031,2.436
he&amp;#39;s briefed anyone else on it in terms of the,701.467,2.202
intelligence community -- either Admiral Rogers or,703.669,2.302
Comey -- of whether this is something they,705.971,1.335
shared with him.,707.306,0.934
"But I think after the meeting, hopefully",708.24,2.169
"depending on the classification level, we",710.409,1.468
may be able to share more on that with you.,711.877,2.803
"The Press: Can I just add, is the President concerned",714.68,3.137
"at all that there will be an appearance immediately,",717.817,2.836
today that he has interfered with an ongoing,720.653,2.536
investigation -- whether it&amp;#39;s a congressional,723.189,1.868
investigation or the executive branch,725.057,1.568
investigation by meeting privately with a,726.625,1.902
congressman who says he has information?,728.527,1.902
Mr. Spicer: So let me get this straight.,730.429,1.935
"Number one, we asked -- as you know, two weeks ago,",732.364,2.97
we said this was the appropriate venue.,735.334,1.635
"Number two, you guys have asked us over and over",736.969,2.703
"again, why aren&amp;#39;t we meeting with",739.672,1.635
certain individuals.,741.307,0.667
The chairman of the committee that -- one of,741.974,1.602
the two committees that we asked to look into this --,743.576,2.269
"wants to share his findings,",745.845,0.667
or what he knows.,746.512,0.667
I think that is exactly how we&amp;#39;ve talked,747.179,1.335
about this working.,748.514,0.701
But I would leave it to Congressman Nunes to come,749.215,1.334
"up, and to brief and share his thoughts.",750.549,1.335
I don&amp;#39;t know what his plan is.,751.884,0.667
"Obviously, he sat -- he briefed the media",752.551,5.205
before he briefed us.,757.756,3.637
He went down and talked about what he had found.,761.393,3.904
"So, you know, it&amp;#39;s interesting, I didn&amp;#39;t see",765.297,1.468
any complaints from you guys when he went down and,766.765,1.569
held a press conference for the umpteenth time,768.334,2.869
talking about his findings and what he&amp;#39;s found.,771.203,1.635
There is no complaints from the media when he,772.838,1.368
shares what he has found with you guys.,774.206,2.236
"But when he wants to come up here and tell us, this",776.442,2.402
is where the investigation stands and here&amp;#39;s what,778.844,1.935
"I&amp;#39;ve unloaded -- or excuse me, learned -- there&amp;#39;s",780.779,3.037
seems to be a little bit of an interesting,783.816,1.868
double standard on that.,785.684,1.235
"The Press: Just to close the loop, because the",786.919,3.07
President said that he had additional information,789.989,2.369
that he believed the White House or he or his,792.358,3.37
"representatives would present, related to this",795.728,2.035
"investigation, what Congressman Nunes has is",797.763,2.002
not related to that?,799.765,1.368
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t -- you&amp;#39;re asking me questions,801.133,2.503
that -- he has not briefed us.,803.636,1.968
He has not briefed the President.,805.604,1.535
"You guys, as I noted -- he actually went down and",807.139,2.169
spoke to the media before he shared this with us.,809.308,2.135
So I would ask the colleagues that of yours,811.443,3.17
"that ask questions, more than you have -- you&amp;#39;ve",814.613,2.002
"had -- collectively, the media has more of an",816.615,2.67
opportunity to ask questions and to hear what,819.285,1.801
he has to say than we do at this point.,821.086,1.602
"So once we have more to understand what he said,",822.688,2.569
"to the extent that we can, I&amp;#39;m sure we&amp;#39;ll be glad",825.257,2.236
to share it with you.,827.493,1.435
But the media has more information than we,828.928,2.035
do at this point.,830.963,0.667
Jon.,831.63,0.668
"The Press: Sean, staying on that, didn&amp;#39;t we already",832.298,3.737
know that there was incidental collection of,836.035,1.968
intelligence involving some members of the,838.003,2.169
transition team?,840.172,0.834
And I point to --,841.006,1.068
Mr. Spicer: Not the way you guys ask the questions.,842.074,2.102
"I mean, you questioned us every day about what we",844.176,3.871
"knew, and now you&amp;#39;re coming back to me saying,",848.047,1.935
didn&amp;#39;t we already know this.,849.982,1.001
Well -- I&amp;#39;m doing somewhat of an effective job.,850.983,2.603
"The Press: No, but didn&amp;#39;t we already know that Flynn",853.586,1.334
was monitored in his conversations,854.92,1.335
with Kislyak?,856.255,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Right.,856.922,0.668
The Press: So we know --,857.59,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Again, I guess",858.257,0.834
"my point, John, is I don&amp;#39;t know.",859.091,2.402
"He made a statement, went down to the press.",861.493,2.136
"Until we get briefed on this, until the President",863.629,2.035
"gets briefed, I don&amp;#39;t know what he knows.",865.664,2.536
"And so to ask -- until that occurs, and until we",868.2,3.37
have the ability to share some of that in an,871.57,2.503
"unclassified nature, I don&amp;#39;t want to get ahead of it.",874.073,2.769
I don&amp;#39;t know what he knows.,876.842,1.635
"That&amp;#39;s why, apparently, he&amp;#39;s coming up to share",878.477,1.902
his findings with the President.,880.379,2.302
At least that&amp;#39;s what he said.,882.681,1.268
"Again, let&amp;#39;s wait and see how this unfolds.",883.949,2.269
"The Press: And on the American Health Care Act,",886.218,2.336
"Mark Meadows says they don&amp;#39;t have the votes, they",888.554,1.702
need to start over and do a new bill.,890.256,2.335
That sounds like you&amp;#39;re in pretty serious trouble.,892.591,2.603
"Mr. Spicer: No, that sounds like one member&amp;#39;s opinion.",895.194,2.369
As I mentioned --,897.563,0.767
The Press: Who represents a,898.33,0.801
large contingent of people who oppose the bill.,899.131,2.369
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, no, but again, I just named a",901.5,1.335
few of the members that are part of that caucus,902.835,1.368
that have come on board.,904.203,0.667
"I think that -- look, every day, you see more",904.87,1.435
and more of those members from that caucus and,906.305,2.502
throughout the entire conference express their,908.807,3.537
support for the bill.,912.344,0.701
The President was up yesterday for a while,913.045,2.202
talking to them.,915.247,0.934
We&amp;#39;ve had members -- and the Vice President has,916.181,1.435
"been actively engaged -- Mick Mulvaney, Reince",917.616,2.036
"Priebus, Marc Short and Rick Dearborn, who lead",919.652,2.569
our leg affairs team.,922.221,1.234
These guys have been flooding the Hill.,923.455,1.936
"They&amp;#39;ve been on the phone, having meetings with them.",925.391,2.402
There&amp;#39;s been a series of members up here all day.,927.793,2.069
I think the trajectory is going very well for us.,929.862,2.903
The Press: And Heritage Action says you can easily,932.765,3.904
fix this bill simply by removing the regulatory,936.669,2.569
framework -- the tax credits and all of that --,939.238,2.569
and you&amp;#39;ll get massive buy-in from conservatives.,941.807,2.603
But can you do that?,944.41,1.201
Mr. Spicer: There are certain constraints that,945.611,2.202
we have in the reconciliation process.,947.813,1.635
And for those who are steeped in the arcane,949.448,2.703
"rules of the Senate, there&amp;#39;s a thing called the",952.151,2.269
"Byrd Rule, and it does not allow policy",954.42,2.969
to be recreated.,957.389,0.935
It has to do with the budgetary nature of that,958.324,5.105
vehicle to get -- that&amp;#39;s sustainable at 50 votes.,963.429,3.036
"Right now, there are certain things that I",966.465,1.368
think a lot of people would like but that will,967.833,1.969
not potentially get ruled in order by the,969.802,2.102
Senate parliamentarian.,971.904,1.234
"So I understand what people want, but I think",973.138,2.336
that we have created a vehicle to get this done.,975.474,2.603
This is the only way that we will repeal,978.077,2.669
and replace Obamacare.,980.746,1.101
"And again, I think people have to recognize that",981.847,2.436
there is a three-step process to doing this.,984.283,1.935
"This is exactly how the Democrats enacted it, and",986.218,3.303
this is exactly how we will unwind it and,989.521,2.002
implement a much better system.,991.523,1.836
"That&amp;#39;s it, plain and simple.",993.359,1.001
Margaret.,994.36,0.667
"The Press: Sean, I know you can&amp;#39;t get ahead of",995.027,3.17
"Nunes, but what he said was, incidental, legal",998.197,2.736
"surveillance using a FISA warrant, which would --",1000.933,2.736
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t believe he said FISA warrant.,1003.669,2.536
The Press: He did.,1006.205,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Did he?,1006.872,0.667
Okay.,1007.539,0.668
The Press: He did.,1008.207,0.667
"And that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m asking this question, which is,",1008.874,2.135
does the Trump administration have the,1011.009,2.336
presumption that foreign leaders or foreign,1013.345,2.636
nationals will not be surveilled when they are,1015.981,2.703
in contact with --,1018.684,1.668
"Mr. Spicer: No, look, again, as I said, I don&amp;#39;t",1020.352,1.935
want to start talking or,1022.287,1.702
"guessing what he may say or may not say,",1023.989,2.436
or explain this.,1026.425,1.168
"I think that we will have more information, or I",1027.593,2.035
hope to have more information once the,1029.628,1.735
"President is briefed, and to find out what else has",1031.363,4.071
gone on in terms of,1035.434,1.168
additional information on this.,1036.602,2.269
But I do think it is a startling revelation and,1038.871,3.036
there&amp;#39;s a lot of questions that need to get asked.,1041.907,1.802
I think it&amp;#39;s interesting all of the questions are,1043.709,2.669
"in the presumptive negative towards us, as",1046.378,1.902
"opposed to &amp;quot;why was this taking place, why were",1048.28,2.87
people surveilled ostensibly; they were,1051.15,3.937
involved in the campaign.&amp;quot; Because it&amp;#39;s not --,1055.087,1.902
"The Press: Well, that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m trying to clarify that --",1056.989,1.535
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, the question is --",1058.524,0.634
the question --,1059.158,0.567
The Press: -- was your presumption that,1059.725,0.4
foreign nationals --,1060.125,0.868
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, it&amp;#39;s not a presumption.",1060.993,0.834
"Actually, I&amp;#39;m not the one --",1061.827,0.968
The Press: (Inaudible.),1062.795,0.734
Mr. Spicer: Right.,1063.529,0.567
"Respectfully, I&amp;#39;m not the one with the presumption",1064.096,1.735
-- you guys are.,1065.831,0.801
I didn&amp;#39;t come up here presuming anything.,1066.632,1.234
I actually started my comments off by saying that --,1067.866,3.07
"The Press: Well, I would presume that foreign",1070.936,0.834
nationals are being monitored by U.S.,1071.77,2.036
intelligence when they are talking to anyone.,1073.806,2.168
Mr. Spicer: And then the question -- I think,1075.974,2.336
"there&amp;#39;s a series of questions, which is, how",1078.31,2.269
many times was an individual picked up?,1080.579,1.802
Why were they picked up?,1082.381,0.767
Were they unmasked?,1083.148,0.834
"Again, a lot of this, if they&amp;#39;re picked up during a",1083.982,1.902
"FISA warrant, is that American citizens are",1085.884,2.069
"prohibited by law from being unmasked, from",1087.953,3.036
&amp;quot;having their name put out there.&amp;quot; Why would,1090.989,1.936
someone&amp;#39;s name get put out there?,1092.925,1.368
What ways were they described?,1094.293,1.601
There&amp;#39;s a lot of questions that need to get asked.,1095.894,2.336
Those are the relevant issues that need to get asked.,1098.23,2.436
How many times was one individual followed?,1100.666,2.803
"Did their name get unmasked, and why?",1103.469,2.035
But there&amp;#39;s a lot of things that need to get,1105.504,2.869
followed up on.,1108.373,0.868
"We&amp;#39;re not at that position yet, as I&amp;#39;ve said",1109.241,2.035
now multiple times.,1111.276,0.935
"The Chairman is going to come up here, brief the",1112.211,2.035
"President, I don&amp;#39;t know to what extent and",1114.246,1.902
to what detail.,1116.148,0.967
"But hopefully, as we move forward, we will have more.",1117.115,2.269
The Press: Is this what you&amp;#39;ve been -- because,1119.384,1.469
"you&amp;#39;ve said there&amp;#39;s more information to come,",1120.853,1.735
more information to come.,1122.588,1.635
Is this what you&amp;#39;ve been gesturing towards?,1124.223,2.802
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know.,1127.025,1.402
"For the eighth time, there is no -- we don&amp;#39;t know",1128.427,3.837
what he&amp;#39;s going to come up here and,1132.264,1.335
explain and share.,1133.599,1.234
"And until that happens, for me to talk about where",1134.833,2.736
"we think this is headed -- again, we&amp;#39;re not in the",1137.569,2.136
business of trying to get to this point yet.,1139.705,2.035
"We say, this is what they have.",1141.74,1.435
We&amp;#39;ve asked that the investigation be conducted,1143.175,3.036
and that people gather up information.,1146.211,1.535
"What they have and to what extent, we&amp;#39;ll know soon.",1147.746,2.803
April.,1150.549,0.667
"The Press: Sean, I have a series of questions on a topic.",1151.216,3.404
"Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, met with an",1154.62,3.103
official here at the White House yesterday.,1157.723,2.169
She&amp;#39;s looking for fairness and justice in,1159.892,2.168
her son&amp;#39;s case.,1162.06,0.935
What should we expect to come out of that meeting,1162.995,3.103
with this White House official?,1166.098,1.535
Should there be a push to make sure that there is an,1167.633,3.737
indictment of the police officer&amp;#39;s --,1171.37,1.835
"Mr. Spicer: I mean, that&amp;#39;s a Department of Justice question.",1173.205,2.836
"For us to get involved in a case, a specific case,",1176.041,4.538
would be highly inappropriate in terms of,1180.579,2.636
trying to guess what the outcome of a case should be.,1183.215,2.969
"The Press: Well, along that line, the official,",1186.184,3.17
"according to Ms. Carr, reached out to the",1189.354,2.836
"Department of Justice, the civil rights division, had",1192.19,2.803
"the wrong number; called another department, had",1194.993,2.436
the right number.,1197.429,1.068
"Now, in previous administrations, to",1198.497,1.735
include the Obama administration and other,1200.232,2.102
"administrations, the Department of Justice had",1202.334,1.935
limited the numbers of people to call over to the,1204.269,3.07
Department of Justice.,1207.339,0.968
"Has the Attorney General, this Attorney General",1208.307,2.235
"Sessions, changed that memo?",1210.542,1.301
What has he done?,1211.843,1.268
"Mr. Spicer: Well, it would have to be reissued.",1213.111,2.903
That&amp;#39;s a separate issue in terms of -- every Attorney,1216.014,3.203
"General issues a memo going back to, I think,",1219.217,3.571
Mukasey was the first one -- post-Watergate -- I&amp;#39;m,1222.788,3.069
trying to remember who issued the first one.,1225.857,2.236
But it has been a practice of I think almost every,1228.093,2.569
Attorney General to issue a memo spelling out the,1230.662,4.672
procedures that officials in the Justice Department,1235.334,1.635
"contact the White House and who they can contact,",1236.969,1.334
and the nature of which and what their exceptions,1238.303,1.368
"are, et cetera.",1239.671,0.668
"Those memos get crafted by each administration, by",1240.339,1.334
each new Attorney General.,1241.673,0.668
I would refer you back to the Department of Justice,1242.341,1.334
on the status of that under this Attorney General.,1243.675,1.335
The Press: So how many officials here have that,1245.01,1.335
"right, to call the Department of Justice,",1246.345,1.368
even if it&amp;#39;s for --,1247.713,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know the answer.,1248.38,1.335
I would refer you to the Department of Justice.,1249.715,1.334
The Press: But was there wrongdoing in this effort,1251.049,1.335
to call over to the Department of Justice?,1252.384,1.335
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know.,1253.719,0.667
I don&amp;#39;t know the nature of -- I&amp;#39;ll have to look into,1254.386,1.368
what you&amp;#39;re asking.,1255.754,0.667
"But I would, again, refer you back to the",1256.421,1.335
Department of Justice.,1257.756,4.872
Hunter.,1262.628,5.038
The Press: Yes.,1267.666,5.872
"Thank you, Sean.",1273.538,0.668
I have two quick questions.,1274.206,2.169
"Last November, President Trump dismissed reports he",1276.375,2.636
was trying to obtain security clearances for,1279.011,2.669
his children as &amp;quot;a typically false news,1281.68,3.103
story.&amp;quot; Now there are reports Ivanka Trump is,1284.783,2.369
indeed attempting to obtain a clearance.,1287.152,1.735
What changed there?,1288.887,1.068
"Mr. Spicer: Well, at the time, it was not true.",1289.955,2.269
"I mean, she wasn&amp;#39;t obtaining a security",1292.224,2.202
"clearance, so it was not accurate then.",1294.426,3.937
There was no -- I think we addressed it,1298.363,3.304
during the transition.,1301.667,1.334
An official had actually just inquired.,1303.001,2.169
There was no actual attempt at the time.,1305.17,2.169
The official in question was removed from,1307.339,3.37
the transition team.,1310.709,0.834
They had merely made an inquiry into what it would,1311.543,2.669
take to get an SF-86 process moving forward.,1314.212,4.338
"No paperwork was ever drawn, no account was",1318.55,2.002
"opened, and that official was let go.",1320.552,2.769
"At this time, as I mentioned yesterday,",1323.321,2.57
"Ivanka has decided to go above and beyond, and act",1325.891,5.272
in certain ways to ensure that she complies with,1331.163,2.836
certain rules by maintaining the Federal,1333.999,2.502
"Records Act, getting a security clearance so that",1336.501,2.87
if she is privy to any information that is,1339.371,2.636
"classified, she has to abide by the same rules",1342.007,2.402
and regulations in terms of being in a room and how,1344.409,2.169
"it&amp;#39;s handled, et cetera.",1346.578,1.168
We have taken appropriate measures to do that.,1347.746,2.135
I mentioned the statement,1349.881,0.835
yesterday and will stick by it.,1350.716,1.434
The Press: And then the second question,1352.15,1.368
on Paul Manafort.,1353.518,1.535
The Associated Press has published a report based,1355.053,2.302
on documents that he had a plan to &amp;quot;benefit&amp;quot; Vladimir,1357.355,3.371
Putin for a client.,1360.726,1.434
"And with him back in the headlines, I&amp;#39;m just",1362.16,1.835
wondering if you still stand by the comment that,1363.995,2.303
he had a &amp;quot;limited role&amp;quot; on the campaign.,1366.298,2.235
And if you could explain a little bit more about how,1368.533,2.169
spending months as the campaign&amp;#39;s top official,1370.702,2.569
is a limited role.,1373.271,1.469
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, thank you.",1374.74,1.901
I&amp;#39;ve tried to avoid commenting.,1376.641,1.569
I know I&amp;#39;ve talked to a lot of you about the,1378.21,3.069
"individual stories, but I think obviously this one",1381.279,2.57
has started to catch a lot of buzz.,1383.849,2.369
"So to comment briefly on this, I think nothing in",1386.218,3.904
this morning&amp;#39;s report referenced any actions by,1390.122,3.036
"the President, the White House, or any Trump",1393.158,2.669
administration official.,1395.827,0.901
I think that&amp;#39;s got to be clear from the get-go.,1396.728,3.137
The report is entirely focused on actions that,1399.865,4.137
Paul took a decade ago regarding -- he&amp;#39;s a former,1404.002,4.037
"advisor of the campaign, and the actions that came",1408.039,2.069
to light this morning are about a client that,1410.108,1.502
he had last decade.,1411.61,2.802
"I know I commented on this the other day, and clearly",1414.412,2.536
I should have been more precise with,1416.948,1.335
respect to Paul&amp;#39;s role.,1418.283,1.268
So let me clarify this and kind of go,1419.551,1.435
through the facts.,1420.986,1.101
Paul was hired to oversee the campaign&amp;#39;s,1422.087,2.369
delegate operation.,1424.456,1.468
He had played a significant role in the,1425.924,1.335
convention and delegate operations of four,1427.259,2.636
"previous Republican nominees -- Bob Dole,",1429.895,2.802
"former Presidents George H. Bush,",1432.697,1.869
Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford.,1434.566,2.102
"And to be clear, he got the job done",1436.668,2.369
on the delegates.,1439.037,1.368
The President won the Republican nomination,1440.405,1.802
after months of speculation after a,1442.207,1.902
potentially contested contest -- convention.,1444.109,3.603
"In total, he was involved with the campaign for a",1447.712,3.07
total of just under five months.,1450.782,2.002
He was first hired on March 28th to oversee,1452.784,2.503
delegate operations.,1455.287,1.334
He was made the chief strategist and campaign,1456.621,1.735
chairman on May 19th.,1458.356,1.769
And his relationship with the campaign ended,1460.125,2.502
on August 19th.,1462.627,1.669
The AP story focuses on his activities,1464.296,2.068
from the last decade.,1466.364,1.635
"And to place in to context, Paul represented",1467.999,2.102
"many foreign clients, according to publicly",1470.101,2.303
"available data, in the Caribbean, Asia,",1472.404,1.835
Africa and Europe.,1474.239,1.301
His representation of foreign clients is public,1475.54,2.469
"and similar to the work of Tony Podesta, a Clinton",1478.009,2.303
"campaign fundraiser, whose brother John chaired",1480.312,2.502
Hillary Clinton&amp;#39;s campaign.,1482.814,1.635
Last year -- not last decade -- Tony Podesta,1484.449,3.07
lobbied against sanctions for Russia&amp;#39;s largest bank.,1487.519,2.936
"And John Podesta, Clinton&amp;#39;s campaign chair,",1490.455,1.969
sat on the board of a Russian-based energy company.,1492.424,3.537
"This was something tied to Hillary Clinton, who was",1495.961,1.768
the face of the failed Russia reset policy.,1497.729,1.969
So it&amp;#39;s not even close -- what we&amp;#39;re talking about,1499.698,2.969
now isn&amp;#39;t even close to her most significant role,1502.667,3.037
with respect to Russia.,1505.704,1.434
"As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, along",1507.138,1.869
"with the Obama administration, approved a",1509.007,1.668
deal that gave Russia one-fifth of America&amp;#39;s,1510.675,3.771
uranium reserves.,1514.446,1.468
"Hillary&amp;#39;s husband, former President Bill Clinton,",1515.914,2.002
received over half a million dollars by a paid,1517.916,2.669
speech by a bank connected to the uranium deal.,1520.585,3.704
And Vladimir Putin personally called the,1524.289,2.336
former President and thanked him for,1526.625,1.401
giving the speech.,1528.026,0.734
So an individual who worked for less than --,1528.76,2.569
the campaign for five months for the President&amp;#39;s,1531.329,2.236
"two-year long campaign, who worked with a Russian",1533.565,2.135
"entity a decade ago, is the subject of rampant",1535.7,2.503
"media speculation all day long, even though the",1538.203,2.269
Clintons had much more expensive -- extensive,1540.472,2.803
"ties, while Secretary of State Hillary was crafting",1543.275,3.436
a policy she said was designed &amp;quot;strengthen,1546.711,3.137
"Russia.&amp;quot; And to be clear, the President has no",1549.848,3.036
personal financial dealings with Russia.,1552.884,2.302
His ties are limited to hosting a contest in,1555.186,2.47
"Russia once, and selling a Palm Beach home to a",1557.656,2.002
businessman in 2005.,1559.658,2.135
That&amp;#39;s it.,1561.793,1.168
And for members of the media trying to conflate,1562.961,3.403
"Paul&amp;#39;s role in activities with Monday&amp;#39;s hearing, I",1566.364,2.369
"have another reminder: Numerous individuals,",1568.733,2.436
including former Obama Director of National,1571.169,1.969
"Intelligence, James Clapper, and acting CIA",1573.138,2.235
Director Mike Morrell and members of the,1575.373,1.435
intelligence community from both parties who have,1576.808,2.269
been briefed have said across the board that they,1579.077,2.069
have seen zero evidence of any collusion between the,1581.146,2.569
Trump campaign and Russian officials.,1583.715,2.269
And that&amp;#39;s not going to be changed by former business,1585.984,2.402
dealings of a campaign staffer from a decade ago.,1588.386,3.604
Sara.,1591.99,0.667
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1592.657,1.201
You and other senior administration officials,1593.858,2.269
have sought to assure skeptical Republican,1596.127,2.236
lawmakers that phase two of these regulatory,1598.363,2.636
modifications will address some of their concerns.,1600.999,2.636
So what is Secretary Tom Price waiting for?,1603.635,3.003
Why not roll out phase two now if the vote is looking,1606.638,4.504
like it&amp;#39;s going to be a very close marker?,1611.142,3.37
Mr. Spicer: I think in some of those cases -- and,1614.512,2.67
"it&amp;#39;s tied to -- it&amp;#39;s all one package, and that&amp;#39;s",1617.182,3.603
why I think you saw some of the stuff he is working,1620.785,2.203
"on, some of the stuff he is doing.",1622.988,1.668
But I think the important piece is to get the,1624.656,1.501
phase-one part of it done.,1626.157,2.002
He has assured them and talked to them about,1628.159,2.57
different administrative actions.,1630.729,1.701
"Again, part of this is sequencing.",1632.43,1.802
"I mean, the same way that in Obamacare they didn&amp;#39;t",1634.232,2.536
just have Kathleen Sebelius then go out and,1636.768,2.102
start implementing things.,1638.87,1.535
They passed the bill first through the reconciliation,1640.405,2.035
"process, got that done, and then she did the",1642.44,1.869
administrative piece.,1644.309,0.834
We&amp;#39;re doing the same process because of how,1645.143,3.737
some of the sequencing has to occur.,1648.88,3.103
"And then the same thing on the legislative front,",1651.983,1.769
we&amp;#39;ve introduced in the House -- all those pieces,1653.752,2.535
of legislation have been done.,1656.287,1.602
"Leader McCarthy has started to talk about the,",1657.889,2.436
that do all of the prong -- three steps.,1660.325,2.069
"So a lot of it is coming together, but part of it",1662.394,2.235
"is, is a sequencing aspect that needs to",1664.629,2.77
get taken care of.,1667.399,1.701
But we are moving in the right direction.,1669.1,1.602
Can I go to John (inaudible) for the first,1670.702,2.202
question on Skype?,1672.904,0.701
The Press: Yes.,1673.605,2.402
"Good afternoon, Sean, from (inaudible) in Newport.",1676.007,3.137
"Sean, you have a lot of members of the media",1679.144,4.804
saying that President Trump -- the President to,1683.948,3.838
all the people.,1687.786,1.434
What does the President say -- (inaudible)?,1689.22,3.337
"Yesterday, you had (inaudible) White House",1692.557,2.87
grandstanding at the confirmation hearing.,1695.427,2.402
"We&amp;#39;ve had Elizabeth Warren (inaudible), the Boston",1697.829,3.37
Globe condemning the (inaudible).,1701.199,1.902
"You had Rhode Island Governor, Gina",1703.101,2.869
"Raimondo, boycott.",1705.97,0.968
You had (inaudible) while she fundraised,1706.938,2.87
around the country.,1709.808,1.434
What&amp;#39;s the President saying to frustrated Trump,1711.242,3.37
supporters who don&amp;#39;t feel they&amp;#39;re getting proper,1714.612,3.337
representation (inaudible) and in Congress?,1717.949,2.402
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I mean, I think with respect to",1720.351,4.805
"Judge Gorsuch, which is I think -- pretty clear",1725.156,4.305
that&amp;#39;s where you&amp;#39;re headed on this -- The Press: Yes.,1729.461,4.804
Mr. Spicer: Thank you.,1734.265,1.902
"I just -- I mean, when you look at the praise, I",1736.167,4.038
"mean, obviously I would love for it",1740.205,1.401
to be universal.,1741.606,1.368
And while we&amp;#39;ve gotten bipartisan praise from,1742.974,2.87
"pundits and former law clerks in both parties,",1745.844,5.238
high number of jurists and former people -- legal,1751.082,4.838
"scholars, members of Congress, we&amp;#39;re not",1755.92,2.303
going to win everybody.,1758.223,0.7
And I think that Democrats have tried to score some,1758.923,3.037
points on the committee.,1761.96,1.735
They&amp;#39;ve largely fallen by the wayside.,1763.695,1.635
And we&amp;#39;ve seen very high praise for him.,1765.33,4.137
So I would just suggest that anybody who&amp;#39;s got a,1769.467,2.936
"problem with him, I&amp;#39;d love to hear it, because so far",1772.403,3.771
most of the issues -- no one seems to have a,1776.174,1.535
"problem with his academic credentials, his",1777.709,1.935
record or anything else.,1779.644,2.769
So I&amp;#39;m pretty buoyed by a lot of what we&amp;#39;ve seen,1782.413,4.472
come out of Capitol Hill with respect to him.,1786.885,1.868
Blake.,1788.753,0.667
"The Press: Sean, thanks.",1789.42,0.901
Do you take the House Freedom Caucus at their,1790.321,2.369
"word, Mark Meadows at their word?",1792.69,1.869
There are at least two dozen or so who are &amp;quot;nos.&amp;quot;,1794.559,2.836
So how do you get from this point right now,1797.395,2.803
"policy-wise to tomorrow -- something, anything that",1800.198,2.636
maybe might flip that?,1802.834,1.535
Mr. Spicer: I think we&amp;#39;re doing it.,1804.369,2.602
"I mean, piece by piece, member by member, we&amp;#39;re",1806.971,2.369
"getting there, and we&amp;#39;re getting much closer.",1809.34,1.602
The last couple days we&amp;#39;ve continued to do that.,1810.942,4.538
"But then today alone, I mentioned a couple",1815.48,2.069
of the other members.,1817.549,1.534
"Slowly but surely we&amp;#39;re getting there, and I feel",1819.083,1.836
"confident that when the vote comes up,",1820.919,1.334
we&amp;#39;ll have the votes.,1822.253,0.801
"The Press: And let me ask you today, Patrick",1823.054,1.902
"McHenry, congressman, deputy whip, described the",1824.956,2.936
"President, as members of Congress were coming in",1827.892,2.569
"here to the White House, as the &amp;quot;closer.&amp;quot;",1830.461,2.036
Do you embrace that label?,1832.497,1.568
Mr. Spicer: He is the closer.,1834.065,0.767
The Press: Do you embrace that label here as it,1834.832,1.035
relates to healthcare?,1835.867,0.867
Mr. Spicer: Absolutely.,1836.734,0.901
Ayesha.,1837.635,1.735
The Press: You just said that you&amp;#39;re confident that,1839.37,2.736
the healthcare bill will pass tomorrow.,1842.106,1.569
I want to get a sense of how confident you are.,1843.675,3.003
I don&amp;#39;t know if you want to rate your percentage on it.,1846.678,2.802
"Like, how confident are you that the bill will pass?",1849.48,3.37
"And if it doesn&amp;#39;t pass, is there a plan B?",1852.85,2.737
"Mr. Spicer: No, there is no plan B.",1855.587,1.301
There&amp;#39;s plan A and plan A.,1856.888,2.369
We&amp;#39;re going to get this done.,1859.257,1.468
The Press: And so you&amp;#39;re confident -- 100,1860.725,1.535
percent confident?,1862.26,0.734
Mr. Spicer: We&amp;#39;re going to get it done.,1862.994,1.668
That&amp;#39;s it -- plain and simple.,1864.662,1.235
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1865.897,1.368
I know you said you didn&amp;#39;t know what information you,1867.265,2.402
"were going to find out today from Chairman Nunes,",1869.667,2.937
"but my question for you is, when did the President",1872.604,2.302
know about this surveillance that the,1874.906,2.269
Congressman brought up today on Capitol Hill?,1877.175,2.069
He spoke late last week about -- we&amp;#39;ll find out,1879.244,3.37
more information that would support these,1882.614,2.268
wiretapping claims.,1884.882,1.202
Is this the information he was talking about?,1886.084,2.469
"Mr. Spicer: Until Chairman Nunes briefs him, we don&amp;#39;t",1888.553,2.002
know what he knows versus what the President has,1890.555,3.17
been made aware of.,1893.725,0.667
"And so how that jives, I don&amp;#39;t know.",1894.392,2.836
I hope to have more for you later.,1897.228,1.335
The Press: And a quick follow-up on healthcare,1898.563,1.968
and just a quick follow-up on Asia.,1900.531,2.837
Does the President believe the healthcare bill will,1903.368,2.202
pass the House tomorrow?,1905.57,1.034
Mr. Spicer: Yes.,1906.604,1.268
Jonathan.,1907.872,0.667
The Press: Two questions on Paul Manafort.,1908.539,2.169
Did the President know that he had worked to,1910.708,3.504
advance Putin&amp;#39;s interests previous to becoming,1914.212,2.302
the campaign chairman?,1916.514,1.168
"Mr. Spicer: No, the President was not aware of",1917.682,3.704
Paul&amp;#39;s clients from last decade.,1921.386,1.902
No.,1923.288,0.667
The Press: But is that a problem?,1923.955,1.368
"You know, now that all this is coming out and",1925.323,1.401
there is a whole lot scrutiny --,1926.724,1.735
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, but what is coming up?",1928.459,1.335
What else don&amp;#39;t we know?,1929.794,0.667
"I mean, where he went to school, what grades he",1930.461,1.335
"got, who played he played with in the sandbox?",1931.796,1.602
"The Press: Well, you didn&amp;#39;t know that Michael",1933.398,1.334
Flynn was --,1934.732,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: Okay, I -- thanks, Peter.",1935.4,1.334
I&amp;#39;m answering a question --,1936.734,0.701
The Press: We&amp;#39;re all part of the conversation.,1937.435,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: No, you&amp;#39;re not, actually.",1938.77,1.334
"The answer to your question is, I think to",1940.104,3.637
talk about someone having a client from 10 years ago,1943.741,2.436
that had a consulting company with clients from,1946.177,2.536
around the world -- The Press: He paid millions of,1948.713,1.335
dollars to advance Putin&amp;#39;s interests.,1950.048,1.334
"I mean, that&amp;#39;s enough --",1951.382,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I don&amp;#39;t know what he got paid to.",1952.05,1.568
If you listen to what Paul --,1953.618,0.934
The Press: The documents said --,1954.552,1.335
Mr. Spicer: Hold on. I understand.,1955.887,1.334
"I&amp;#39;m going to answer your question, if you",1957.221,1.335
give me a second.,1958.556,0.667
"That he was a consultant, he had clients from",1959.223,2.67
around the world.,1961.893,0.767
There is no suggestion that he did,1962.66,1.702
anything improper.,1964.362,1.201
But to suggest that that President knew who his,1965.563,5.472
clients were from a decade ago is a bit insane.,1971.035,3.437
There is not -- he was not a government employee.,1974.472,1.835
He didn&amp;#39;t fill out any,1976.307,0.768
paperwork attesting to something.,1977.075,1.334
"There is nothing that he did that suggests, at this",1978.409,2.469
"point, that anything was nefarious.",1980.878,1.602
He was hired to do a job; he did it.,1982.48,2.269
That&amp;#39;s it -- plain and simple.,1984.749,1.068
"The Press: I&amp;#39;m just saying, given that it was",1985.817,1.902
such a focus -- you brought it up just then,1987.719,1.568
"with Hillary Clinton, that these were corrupt",1989.287,2.702
arrangements and that the Clinton Foundation was,1991.989,2.47
"described as a criminal enterprise, and there was",1994.459,2.702
all this discussion of Russia.,1997.161,1.068
And you&amp;#39;ve pointed out --,1998.229,2.035
Mr. Spicer: There is a big,2000.264,0.334
difference between -- there was dollars -- hold on --,2000.598,1.168
The Press: I understand.,2001.766,0.367
I&amp;#39;m not conflating the President.,2002.133,1.201
"I&amp;#39;m just asking, is he disappointed, now that he",2003.334,1.802
"has found this out, that there was this --",2005.136,1.635
"Mr. Spicer: Found out what, Jonathan?",2006.771,0.867
That he had a client over a --,2007.638,1.469
"The Press: That he was working for Putin, for a lot of money.",2009.107,1.268
"Mr. Spicer: -- in the past decade, he had a client,",2010.375,2.235
and you&amp;#39;re worried about what?,2012.61,1.368
That he held -- I mean --,2013.978,0.901
The Press: That he was,2014.879,1.235
doing work to advance Putin&amp;#39;s interests.,2016.114,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know what work he was doing.,2016.781,1.468
So to suggest that just because he had a client in,2018.249,2.803
the past decade that no one is suggesting was,2021.052,3.87
anything improper -- he was hired to count,2024.922,2.303
"delegates, which is what he did, and he was",2027.225,2.469
"successful at it, as he had done for George",2029.694,2.335
"Herbert Walker Bush, Gerald Ford, and Bob Dole.",2032.029,2.837
"He was hired to do a job, and he did it, and",2034.866,1.835
he did it fine.,2036.701,1.068
So -- Steven.,2037.769,1.635
"The Press: Sean, why did the President fire",2039.404,1.034
Paul Manafort?,2040.438,1.368
"Mr. Spicer: Well, for two reasons.",2041.806,1.034
"One is, I think, that there were some issues",2042.84,2.169
coming up with his ties to Ukraine that were,2045.009,3.67
becoming a distraction.,2048.679,1.368
"And secondly, he was, I think, sixteen",2050.047,1.635
points down at the time.,2051.682,3.037
And he was down in the 20s in women.,2054.719,2.002
And I think the President recognized that he needed,2056.721,2.102
to make a change for those two reasons.,2058.823,1.868
The Press: Second question on healthcare.,2060.691,1.802
As confident and as optimistic as you are --,2062.493,2.903
if at this point tomorrow you don&amp;#39;t have the magic,2065.396,3.003
number -- should the Speaker pull the,2068.399,1.635
bill from the floor?,2070.034,0.834
"Mr. Spicer: No, this is it.",2070.868,0.668
If you want to see Obamacare repealed and,2071.536,1.334
"replaced, this is the vote, this is",2072.87,1.335
the time to act.,2074.205,0.701
This is what people have told the American people,2074.906,1.334
is going to happen.,2076.24,0.668
This vote needs to happen.,2076.908,0.667
"If you&amp;#39;re waiting for your chance, this is it.",2077.575,1.335
We need to act.,2078.91,0.667
Cheryl.,2079.577,0.667
The Press: Thank you.,2080.244,0.668
Wall Street appears to be getting a little nervous,2080.912,1.334
about the possibility of tax reform this year.,2082.246,1.368
Can you say definitively that the President will,2083.614,1.335
present a package of tax reforms this year?,2084.949,1.335
Mr. Spicer: Yes.,2086.284,0.667
Darlene.,2086.951,0.667
The Press: What time is the President expected to,2087.618,1.335
meet with Chairman Nunes this afternoon?,2088.953,1.335
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t -- I was walking out as the,2090.288,2.402
Chairman was reiterating -- I literally heard him,2092.69,4.972
"on the streaming -- like, on the -- you know, his",2111.709,5.005
comments -- as he was saying them.,2119.183,1.402
So I don&amp;#39;t know that it was scheduled.,2120.585,1.568
The President was wrapping up a call with Prime,2122.153,2.636
"Minister May at the time that I walked out, so I",2124.789,1.668
don&amp;#39;t know what was scheduled.,2126.457,0.868
The Press: And was there any consideration given to,2127.325,1.801
not meeting with the Chairman given,2129.126,1.335
the appearance --,2130.461,0.701
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know.,2131.162,0.901
I just know what the Chairman said he was doing.,2132.063,3.069
I walked out of here before anything,2135.132,1.702
had been finalized.,2136.834,0.768
He was still wrapping up the call with Theresa,2137.602,2.202
May at the time.,2139.804,0.734
Zeke.,2140.538,0.667
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",2141.205,0.801
"You said the President is the closer, there is no",2142.006,2.202
"plan B, tomorrow is it.",2144.208,1.201
So if you --,2145.409,1.001
"Mr. Spicer: You&amp;#39;ve done a very good job, Zeke.",2146.41,1.836
(Laughter.),2148.246,0.667
"You guys better be careful,",2148.913,0.934
he&amp;#39;s going to put you out of work.,2149.847,2.136
The Press: So if tomorrow night&amp;#39;s outcome doesn&amp;#39;t go,2151.983,2.836
"your way, if the vote fails, what should we then",2154.819,2.836
read into the President&amp;#39;s ability to negotiate and,2157.655,2.369
close deals; the White House&amp;#39;s ability to plant,2160.024,2.402
any sort of legislation and a legislative --,2162.426,2.369
Mr. Spicer: Look -- and I know what you&amp;#39;re trying to,2164.795,3.304
get me to -- but we feel very good about,2168.099,2.302
the trajectory of this.,2170.401,1.068
Members continue to come with us.,2171.469,3.837
"The number is going higher and higher,",2175.306,1.868
not lower and lower.,2177.174,1.268
So the trajectory is great.,2178.442,2.036
"As I mentioned, everybody is out there -- full court",2180.478,2.202
"press on this, and this is opportunity for anybody",2182.68,2.769
who wants to see this done.,2185.449,1.068
"But I just want to be clear, we have a robust",2186.517,4.738
"agenda -- tax reform, as I just mentioned, trade,",2191.255,4.505
immigration.,2195.76,0.667
There&amp;#39;s a lot of other things that,2196.427,1.535
need to get done.,2197.962,1.068
And I think there&amp;#39;s continued to be,2199.03,1.935
widespread support.,2200.965,1.602
"In a lot of cases, bipartisan support for the",2202.567,2.135
President&amp;#39;s agenda.,2204.702,1.201
And so we&amp;#39;re going to continue to,2205.903,1.368
roll on in that.,2207.271,1.001
But we feel very good about where we are now.,2208.272,1.635
Mark.,2209.907,0.668
"The Press: Sean, I was going to ask, in terms of",2210.575,1.468
"after the vote tomorrow night, for those",2212.043,1.334
Republicans who decide to not support the White,2213.377,2.269
"House, what kind of relationship -- any change",2215.646,2.202
in the relationship --,2217.848,1.001
would they see going forward?,2218.849,1.001
Would they expect to see maybe a primary,2219.85,2.103
challenge later on?,2221.953,0.967
Or this is one of those things where they can vote,2222.92,2.136
their conscience if they really believe,2225.056,1.501
this isn&amp;#39;t the bill?,2226.557,1.001
Mr. Spicer: I think we&amp;#39;re obviously -- we believe,2227.558,2.102
that this is a great opportunity to achieve the,2229.66,2.002
principles that we laid out to the,2231.662,1.869
American people.,2233.531,0.667
We&amp;#39;re not looking -- this is not -- the President,2234.198,3.971
made clear yesterday when he visited with the,2238.169,1.768
"conference, he&amp;#39;s not there to threaten them; he&amp;#39;s",2239.937,1.635
"there to explain political landscape to them, and to",2241.572,2.569
explain that -- I think that when you keep your,2244.141,3.571
"promise, no matter what business you&amp;#39;re in, you",2247.712,3.203
tend to be rewarded -- whether it&amp;#39;s your,2250.915,2.235
"customers or your friends, your family, your voters",2253.15,5.406
-- that Washington for too long has suffered a,2258.556,2.002
"deficit of trust, and that we made very clear to the",2260.558,3.937
"American people, if you gave us this opportunity",2264.495,1.869
"and this honor to govern, that we would get",2266.364,2.102
certain things done.,2268.466,1.234
And this was at the top of that list.,2269.7,1.936
And this bill represents the best chance of,2271.636,3.536
repealing and replacing Obamacare and instilling a,2275.172,3.704
patient-centric healthcare system that increases,2278.876,2.636
"choice and lowers cost, and that this is the only",2281.512,2.903
train leaving the station.,2284.415,1.168
Jonathan.,2285.583,0.7
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",2286.283,5.539
"Sean, would then-candidate Donald Trump have hired",2291.822,4.205
"Paul Manafort, such an important and prominent",2296.027,2.769
"position in his campaign, if he had known that he",2298.796,2.836
had had a $10 million contract with somebody so,2301.632,3.537
close to Vladimir Putin to &amp;quot;greatly benefit,2305.169,3.07
the Putin government&amp;quot;?,2308.239,1.268
"If he had known that, would he have hired him?",2309.507,1.768
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know.,2311.275,0.768
"I don&amp;#39;t want to -- Paul was hired, as I said,",2312.043,2.202
to count delegates.,2314.245,1.001
"That&amp;#39;s why he was brought in, as he had been for",2315.246,2.736
"George W. Bush, Gerald Ford, Bob Dole.",2317.982,3.804
He did his job.,2321.786,0.667
That&amp;#39;s what he was there for. And --,2322.453,2.202
The Press: And to run the campaign.,2324.655,1.602
"I mean, he was chairman of the campaign.",2326.257,1.368
"Mr. Spicer: No, no.",2327.625,0.667
"After, what, May 19th or something.",2328.292,1.335
"But again, I&amp;#39;m not going to --",2329.627,0.667
The Press: And to run the convention.,2330.294,1.335
"I mean, you&amp;#39;ll notch it was a very prominent role.",2331.629,1.334
Mr. Spicer: Yeah -- as he had done for,2332.963,1.335
the other three.,2334.298,0.667
"He had held very significant -- look, so",2334.965,1.802
"again, you&amp;#39;re basically saying, hey, the work that",2336.767,1.969
"he did, he had a client a decade ago, would he have",2338.736,2.869
-- I don&amp;#39;t know the answer to that --,2341.605,1.335
The Press: $10 million to,2342.94,0.667
promote the interests of Vladimir Putin.,2343.607,1.836
Mr. Spicer: The answer to your question --,2345.443,1.501
I don&amp;#39;t know.,2346.944,0.701
"To look back right now and to say, if we knew now",2347.645,1.468
"what we know then, would we have done",2349.113,1.368
things different?,2350.481,0.667
I don&amp;#39;t know.,2351.148,0.668
That&amp;#39;s a question that the President would have to,2351.816,1.334
weigh at the time.,2353.15,0.668
The Press: But he definitely didn&amp;#39;t know.,2353.818,1.334
Mr. Spicer: No.,2355.152,0.668
The Press: You&amp;#39;re saying he didn&amp;#39;t know.,2355.82,1.334
"Mr. Spicer: No, he did not know.",2357.154,1.368
The Press: He had not idea that Manafort,2358.522,1.335
had done this.,2359.857,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Of course, not.",2360.524,0.668
"To suggest that he -- I mean, that&amp;#39;s like -- you",2361.192,1.334
can think about how many people are involved in a,2362.526,1.335
campaign of some sort.,2363.861,0.667
"And granted, in this campaign it was",2364.528,1.335
run lean and mean.,2365.863,0.701
But to suggest that everybody knew everybody&amp;#39;s,2366.564,1.868
"background -- did they pay their taxes, how much did",2368.432,1.869
"they pay, what deductions did they take, who did",2370.301,1.735
they work for in the --,2372.036,0.801
The Press: Shouldn&amp;#39;t he have disclosed that?,2372.837,1.701
"I mean, he did work for --",2374.538,1.468
Mr. Spicer: Disclosed what?,2376.006,0.668
That he had done -- The Press: He had worked on,2376.674,1.368
behalf of an adversary of the United States.,2378.042,1.334
He got a $10 million contract.,2379.376,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: Again, I&amp;#39;m not here to vouch for what he",2380.044,1.334
did or how -- I don&amp;#39;t know.,2381.378,0.668
The Press: -- but the President would want to,2382.046,1.334
"know, wouldn&amp;#39;t he?",2383.38,0.668
Mr. Spicer: Maybe.,2384.048,0.867
"Maybe, maybe not.",2384.915,1.068
I don&amp;#39;t know what the circumstances were at the,2385.983,1.802
"time, and I don&amp;#39;t know what exactly -- so for me",2387.785,2.703
to start to infer that what he did or did not do,2390.488,3.069
was anything improper is,2393.557,1.902
not appropriate at this time.,2395.459,1.068
I don&amp;#39;t know what work he did.,2396.527,1.635
"I know what he was hired to do, and he did his job.",2398.162,1.802
Shane.,2399.964,0.667
"The Press: I want to ask about Paul Manafort here, too.",2400.631,1.702
"Are you saying he wasn&amp;#39;t disappointed to learn, in",2402.333,2.235
"the last 24 hours, that his chief strategist",2404.568,3.304
worked for Vladimir Putin&amp;#39;s --,2407.872,2.135
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t --,2410.007,1.301
"no, no -- because again, you&amp;#39;re --",2411.308,1.335
The Press: What was his reaction --,2412.643,1.368
"Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know, because the",2414.011,1.335
story that came out this,2415.346,0.734
morning said that he had had client.,2416.08,1.735
Paul has put out a statement that suggests,2417.815,2.269
"this is what he did, this is how he handled it,",2420.084,1.835
"there were -- I mean, you&amp;#39;ve all read the same.",2421.919,1.668
We have not spent a ton of time going to investigate,2423.587,2.97
what he did for that client a decade ago.,2426.557,1.969
The Press: Is the President disappointed to,2428.526,1.368
learn that this was --,2429.894,0.967
Mr. Spicer: I really have,2430.861,0.935
not discussed the President&amp;#39;s -- I know what,2431.796,1.368
"he has made very clear: He hired him to do a job, he",2433.164,2.936
"did the job well, he got him over the finish line.",2436.1,4.037
"On August 19th, he was let go of the campaign for the",2440.137,2.836
reasons that I have mentioned.,2442.973,1.235
The Press: Can you say if Paul Manafort played any,2444.208,2.836
role in the hiring of any people in the federal,2447.044,1.802
government after the election?,2448.846,0.734
Did he advise the President?,2449.58,0.901
"Mr. Spicer: Not to my knowledge, at all.",2450.481,1.868
John.,2452.349,0.668
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",2453.017,1.468
"Going back to the American Health Care Act, there was",2454.485,3.57
always nervousness that moving too quickly on it,2458.055,3.237
would leave some very dangerous points,2461.292,3.336
in the details.,2464.628,1.702
"Several publications, including Sara&amp;#39;s, reported",2466.33,2.769
"today that as a result of a change of a few words,",2469.099,6.707
veterans who benefitted from a program called,2475.806,2.77
"Veterans Affairs, or had the option of getting tax",2478.576,4.471
"credits, would not get neither under the new",2483.047,4.604
"legislation, and that 7 million veterans would",2487.651,2.703
be cost healthcare.,2490.354,1.368
"Is the administration following this, and is",2491.722,3.237
urging Congress to do anything about it?,2494.959,3.203
Mr. Spicer: Most veterans get their healthcare,2498.162,3.203
"either through TRICARE or through Medicare, if",2501.365,2.669
"they&amp;#39;re over 65 or a combination thereof, correct?",2504.034,3.37
The Press: Well -- but there&amp;#39;s two programs.,2507.404,2.803
"One is the Veterans Affairs program, and the",2510.207,3.237
other is the option -- this is under the current,2513.444,3.503
law -- to have tax credits.,2516.947,2.569
"And my understanding, again, from Sara&amp;#39;s",2519.516,2.57
"publication this morning and several others, is",2522.086,2.869
that 7 million veterans could possibly lose both,2524.955,3.37
under this program.,2528.325,0.734
Mr. Spicer: I would have to follow-up with you.,2529.059,1.936
I&amp;#39;m not aware of any modifications to TRICARE,2530.995,2.202
in particular that would have that effect.,2533.197,1.968
Kristen.,2535.165,0.668
"The Press: Sean, thanks.",2535.833,1.802
"On Monday, the President accused former President",2537.635,2.602
Obama and Democrats of rushing through the,2540.237,2.603
"healthcare law -- jamming it through -- when, in",2542.84,3.336
"fact, they actually debated it for",2546.176,2.236
about a year.,2548.412,1.101
This healthcare law was rolled out about,2549.513,2.603
15 days ago.,2552.116,1.134
"So don&amp;#39;t you run the risk of rushing this through,",2553.25,2.77
of not giving it enough time for public debate?,2556.02,2.502
Mr. Spicer: I think Republicans have talked,2558.522,1.735
about repealing and replacing,2560.257,1.201
Obamacare since 2010.,2561.458,1.635
We&amp;#39;ve campaigned on it in every election since.,2563.093,2.837
The principles that are in a lot of these have been,2565.93,2.469
very public for a long time. And --,2568.399,1.468
The Press: Understood.,2569.867,0.667
"But you just rolled out the specifics, Sean.",2570.534,1.368
You just rolled out the actual --,2571.902,1.335
Mr. Spicer: And it&amp;#39;s gone through three,2573.237,1.334
"committees, two of which",2574.571,2.403
had unanimous Republican support.,2576.974,1.568
The Press: Just a few days ago.,2578.542,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I understand that.,2579.209,0.768
But we&amp;#39;re working it through the process.,2579.977,1.368
"This was something the President campaigned on,",2581.345,2.502
told the American people would be his top priority.,2583.847,1.769
Republicans who ran for the House and Senate said,2585.616,1.935
that it would be a top priority.,2587.551,1.368
It&amp;#39;s something that they talked about for seven,2588.919,1.902
"years, Kristen.",2590.821,0.968
So to suggest that we&amp;#39;re rushing anything -- I,2591.789,2.369
"think we&amp;#39;ve done this very, very, very",2594.158,2.636
"deliberately, and very responsibly to make sure",2596.794,2.936
that people could read it.,2599.73,1.935
"So again, with all due respect to the folks who",2601.665,2.703
"tackled this in the past, we actually put the bill",2604.368,2.269
"online, let everyone in the entire world read it,",2606.637,2.703
"didn&amp;#39;t jam it through and, to quote former Speaker",2609.34,2.369
"Pelosi, say, if you want to read the bill, wait",2611.709,2.435
until we pass it.,2614.144,1.202
We actually let the American people and the,2615.346,2.502
"entire world read what was in it, watch the process",2617.848,2.836
"occur, and I think that is a much more open and",2620.684,3.537
transparent process.,2624.221,1.235
The Press: Let me just ask you a quick question about,2625.456,1.635
the terror attack.,2627.091,1.001
You said that the President has,2628.092,1.201
been briefed.,2629.293,0.667
He also spoke with Prime Minister Theresa May.,2629.96,1.702
Can you give us any more information about who may,2631.662,2.302
have been behind it?,2633.964,0.901
"And should Americans have any concern, or are there",2634.865,2.069
any security changes that they should expect --,2636.934,1.868
"Mr. Spicer: No, that would be highly irresponsible",2638.802,2.503
at this point.,2641.305,0.667
I know the British government is,2641.972,1.468
investigating this as an act of terrorism,2643.44,2.836
at this moment.,2646.276,1.135
So for me to sort of get out and ahead of -- I know,2647.411,2.869
our homeland security team and our national security,2650.28,2.203
team are in contact with them.,2652.483,1.801
"Secretary Tillerson has issued a statement, as has",2654.284,2.67
Homeland Security Secretary Kelly.,2656.954,3.603
So we are continuing to monitor the situation.,2660.557,2.837
We&amp;#39;re in touch with officials in the,2663.394,1.701
British government.,2665.095,1.235
"As I mentioned, as I was walking out here, the",2666.33,2.936
President was finishing up a call with Prime Minister,2669.266,1.935
"May, and so we&amp;#39;ll try to have an additional readout",2671.201,3.704
"to you, to the extent that that&amp;#39;s possible.",2674.905,2.536
But we&amp;#39;re going to provide the assistance we can to,2677.441,1.969
the British government to,2679.41,0.8
help get to the bottom of this.,2680.21,1.335
"At this time, it would be highly irresponsible for",2681.545,2.769
us to get out in front of British officials.,2684.314,2.002
Charlie.,2686.316,0.668
"The Press: You mentioned that there is no plan B,",2686.984,2.436
that plan A is the only vehicle -- the only train,2689.42,2.902
"leaving the station, I believe you said.",2692.322,1.969
Does that mean if the plan fails -- if the bill,2694.291,3.103
"fails, will the President move on to other issues",2697.394,2.536
"he&amp;#39;s concerned about, like trade, and leave",2699.93,2.002
Obamacare in place?,2701.932,0.834
"And if so, how long is he comfortable with",2702.766,2.536
leaving it in place?,2705.302,1.135
"Mr. Spicer: Well, as I mentioned -- I mean, we&amp;#39;re",2706.437,2.168
not going to leave it in place because we&amp;#39;re going,2708.605,1.335
"to repeal and replace it tomorrow, move it through",2709.94,2.035
"the Senate, and the President will",2711.975,1.402
sign the bill.,2713.377,1.301
We continue to see the enthusiasm and momentum,2714.678,3.771
coming to our direction.,2718.449,1.601
"So I&amp;#39;m not looking -- as I mentioned, we&amp;#39;re not",2720.05,2.569
looking at a plan B.,2722.619,0.868
"We have plan A, it&amp;#39;s going to pass, and we&amp;#39;re",2723.487,1.902
going to go from there.,2725.389,0.667
Jessica.,2726.056,0.667
The Press: I&amp;#39;m going to talk about,2726.723,1.435
China for moment.,2728.158,0.834
Do you now have the ability to formally,2728.992,2.169
announce the dates for when President Xi visits,2731.161,2.202
the United States?,2733.363,0.835
Mr. Spicer: I do not know at this time.,2734.198,2.469
The Press: Why not?,2736.667,1.101
Mr. Spicer: Because that&amp;#39;s not how it works.,2737.768,2.169
Because that&amp;#39;s something that we continue to work,2739.937,2.035
with President Xi and the Chinese government to,2741.972,3.337
coordinate the final dates and times.,2745.309,2.102
And then obviously we coordinate the,2747.411,1.368
announcement with them as well.,2748.779,1.068
"But trust me, when we&amp;#39;re ready, we&amp;#39;ll let you and",2749.847,3.303
everyone else know.,2753.15,0.667
The Press: And are you going to be prepared to,2753.817,2.269
talk about the parameters of the bilateral,2756.086,1.602
relationship at that time?,2757.688,0.901
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sure that -- my guess is there will,2758.589,1.835
be a lot to discuss at that time.,2760.424,1.802
Jeff.,2762.226,0.667
"The Press: Sean, has the President asked the FBI",2762.893,2.402
director or the NSA or any other agencies involved to,2765.295,2.937
come here to the White House and brief him on,2768.232,2.002
"this new information, or is it just",2770.234,3.57
the intel chair?,2773.804,1.868
"And if so, why not?",2775.672,2.303
"Mr. Spicer: Well, Jeff, it just happened.",2777.975,1.735
"So it&amp;#39;s a silly question to ask me, literally as",2779.71,1.334
"I&amp;#39;m walking out here, when the Chairman was wrapping",2781.044,1.535
up an event saying that he is announcing that he,2782.579,2.603
is coming down here.,2785.182,0.667
It&amp;#39;s not like we picked up the phone and then,2785.849,1.335
called everyone else.,2787.184,1.001
The first step is to actually hear what he has,2788.185,1.468
"to say and to find out who else he&amp;#39;s briefed, where",2789.653,2.336
"he&amp;#39;s got that information from, and then we&amp;#39;ll take",2791.989,2.335
the next steps going forward.,2794.324,1.135
"The Press: Is this the first of several meetings, though?",2795.459,1.635
Do you believe he would like to have the FBI,2797.094,2.102
director come in?,2799.196,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know.,2799.863,0.668
It&amp;#39;s literally -- it literally just happened as,2800.531,1.368
I was walking out here.,2801.899,0.667
"So to suggest that other steps have occurred, until",2802.566,3.537
that briefing occurs we&amp;#39;ll see what this leads to.,2806.103,3.703
I don&amp;#39;t know.,2809.806,0.735
The Press: What&amp;#39;s the state of his,2810.541,1.334
credibility tonight?,2811.875,0.834
"The Wall Street Journal, which has been very",2812.709,1.602
"supportive of his candidacy and agenda,",2814.311,1.702
simply raised a question that he is not doing very,2816.013,2.836
"well, and they said he could be on the verge of",2818.849,3.103
being a &amp;quot;fake President.&amp;quot;,2821.952,1.134
What do you believe the state of his credibility,2823.086,2.536
is as we sit here today in week nine?,2825.622,2.536
Mr. Spicer: I think the President has made several,2828.158,4.705
"promises to the American people, and",2832.863,1.902
he&amp;#39;s kept them.,2834.765,0.667
"He appointed Neil Gorsuch as the judge, which was",2835.432,2.202
one of 20 people on a list.,2837.634,1.769
He withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership.,2839.403,1.968
He established a five-year lobbying ban and a foreign,2841.371,2.503
"ban on -- lifetime, which is all what he said",2843.874,2.536
he was going to do.,2846.41,0.667
"He said he was going to cut regulations,",2847.077,1.568
and he did that.,2848.645,1.001
He said he was going to start to bring back jobs,2849.646,1.569
-- he did that.,2851.215,0.9
He said that he was going to start to pay real,2852.115,1.569
"attention and respect taxpayers,",2853.684,1.735
bringing down costs.,2855.419,0.834
He&amp;#39;s already done that.,2856.253,1.001
He&amp;#39;s backed a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare.,2857.254,2.903
We&amp;#39;ve talked about that ad nauseam.,2860.157,1.601
He&amp;#39;s talked about putting forth a budget that puts,2861.758,2.069
defense first -- he did that.,2863.827,1.702
He took action on Dakota and Keystone Pipeline --,2865.529,3.103
he did that.,2868.632,0.701
I think when it comes to the President making,2869.333,2.602
"promises to the American people and keeping them,",2871.935,2.336
he&amp;#39;s got a pretty high record of doing it.,2874.271,1.568
Peter.,2875.839,0.667
"The Press: Sean, if I could ask you about the",2876.506,1.602
conversation we&amp;#39;ve been having about Paul,2878.108,1.368
"Manafort, but not specific to Paul Manafort.",2879.476,1.568
"When Michael Flynn&amp;#39;s name came up at the time,",2881.044,2.703
"having not registered as a foreign agent, there was a",2883.747,2.202
lot of focus on the vetting process that goes,2885.949,1.802
into individuals.,2887.751,0.667
"Back then you said, &amp;quot;We trust people to fill out",2888.418,1.735
the appropriate forms that they need to.,2890.153,1.635
He has been very&amp;quot; -- referring to the President,2891.788,2.303
-- &amp;quot;he has been very committed to making sure,2894.091,1.868
we institute high standards here and,2895.959,1.368
we&amp;#39;re held to them.&amp;quot;,2897.327,0.801
"So given your words, is it sufficient to trust the",2898.128,2.803
information that the people you hire give you?,2900.931,2.202
And can you say with certainty with right now,2903.133,1.568
that there isn&amp;#39;t anybody else that&amp;#39;s working in the,2904.701,2.536
interests of another foreign government working,2907.237,1.935
for this government right now?,2909.172,1.001
"Mr. Spicer: It&amp;#39;s a good question, Peter, because",2910.173,1.402
there&amp;#39;s a big difference between working for a,2911.575,1.568
campaign or an entity where there&amp;#39;s no forms to,2913.143,3.437
fill out -- when you work for the United States,2916.58,1.368
"government, especially here in the White House,",2917.948,1.668
"you fill out a security clearance form, you fill",2919.616,1.835
out an employment form that asks certain,2921.451,1.468
questions under the penalty of law.,2922.919,2.77
Those questions --,2925.689,1.101
"The Press: And Michael Flynn still got through, I guess.",2926.79,1.335
Mr. Spicer: Hold on.,2928.125,0.667
"No, well -- but again, he filled out forms",2928.792,1.969
under the penalty of law.,2930.761,1.434
I don&amp;#39;t know what was on his forms or what,2932.195,1.669
not was on his forms.,2933.864,1.168
"Remember, what the President let him go for",2935.032,3.637
"was not being truthful to the Vice President, not",2938.669,2.502
"necessarily for what was on a form, which I do not",2941.171,1.969
know what he filled out or did not fill out.,2943.14,1.768
"If somebody fills out a form here, an SF-86, a",2944.908,2.703
"security clearance form, or another employment",2947.611,2.069
"document, and lies on that form or misleads, then",2949.68,3.303
they&amp;#39;re going to face the penalty of law on that.,2952.983,1.768
That&amp;#39;s a big difference between saying when,2954.751,2.069
someone was hired on a campaign or another,2956.82,2.302
"entity, that they should disclose everything in",2959.122,1.669
their past whether or not they -- who,2960.791,1.868
their clients were.,2962.659,1.335
"But again, I mean, if someone presented a résumé",2963.994,1.902
"and it was faulty, sure, I think that if that was --",2965.896,3.37
"as you recall, there was another person during the",2969.266,3.503
transition that was named to a position that was,2972.769,2.269
discussed as not being truthful with some,2975.038,2.436
of their works.,2977.474,0.701
We let them go.,2978.175,1.968
People write things.,2981.144,1.101
They have jobs.,2982.245,1.735
They describe themselves a certain way.,2983.98,2.136
And every time that I&amp;#39;m aware of that we&amp;#39;ve had an,2986.116,2.769
incident where someone has not been forthright and,2988.885,2.603
"truthful, we&amp;#39;ve let them go.",2991.488,1.735
"But when you work for the United States government,",2993.223,1.902
"you actually fill out security clearance forms,",2995.125,2.202
employment forms under the penalty of law.,2997.327,2.536
None of those cases occurred in the past.,2999.863,1.568
And to dredge up someone&amp;#39;s work from a decade ago --,3001.431,2.536
"it&amp;#39;s not that Paul wasn&amp;#39;t truthful, just to be clear",3003.967,2.202
-- you&amp;#39;re trying to conflate,3006.169,1.001
something that&amp;#39;s there.,3007.17,1.335
You&amp;#39;re trying to make the accusation that somehow he,3008.505,2.402
was dishonest or distruthful.,3010.907,1.268
The Press: I&amp;#39;m not asking about Paul Manafort --,3012.175,2.002
"Mr. Spicer: No, you are.",3014.177,2.169
The Press: I&amp;#39;m not asking about Paul Manafort at all.,3016.346,1.335
Mr. Spicer: Who are you asking about?,3017.681,1.334
"The Press: In fact, what I&amp;#39;m asking is, can you say",3019.015,1.369
with certainty that right now -- that there&amp;#39;s nobody,3020.384,1.334
working for this White House that is presently,3021.718,1.335
working in the interest of a foreign government?,3023.053,1.335
Mr. Spicer: I can tell you that every form has been,3024.388,1.468
filled out -- The Press: So you trust that the,3025.856,2.769
information is -- Mr. Spicer: Absolutely.,3028.625,1.668
You&amp;#39;ve got to -- people who are filling out forms,3030.293,2.169
-- so to sit here and ask me whether I can vouch for,3032.462,2.903
-- whatever it is -- a few hundred people that have,3035.365,2.236
"filled out everything, that would be ridiculous",3037.601,2.936
for me to stand here and,3040.537,0.968
suggest that I possibly could.,3041.505,1.668
"What I can tell you is, under the penalty of law,",3043.173,2.402
every single person has filled out a form that is,3045.575,2.269
being vetted by whatever level of classification,3047.844,2.67
that they need to get by the appropriate law,3050.514,2.002
enforcement agencies or HR entities.,3052.516,4.304
But I can&amp;#39;t prevent somebody from fully,3056.82,4.204
disclosing everything on their taxes or,3061.024,1.502
filling out a form.,3062.526,1.101
What I can tell you is that -- and if there is an,3063.627,1.735
instance brought to our attention where someone,3065.362,2.002
"has misled it, either they will be referred to the",3067.364,2.269
appropriate law enforcement agency or,3069.633,2.035
"dismissed, or appropriate action will be taken.",3071.668,2.069
"But yes, there is no tolerance for that.",3073.737,1.535
"The Press: And then very quickly, in regards to",3075.272,1.368
Devin Nunes and the fact that he&amp;#39;s going to come,3076.64,1.501
today and the comments that you began the,3078.141,1.468
"briefing by telling us -- on March 4th, the",3079.609,2.303
President tweeted: &amp;quot;How low has President Obama,3081.912,2.168
gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred,3084.08,2.403
election process.,3086.483,1.201
This is Nixon/Watergate.,3087.684,1.769
Bad (or sick) guy!&amp;quot;,3089.453,1.267
Does the President stand by his statement that,3090.72,2.403
President Obama is a &amp;quot;bad (or sick) guy&amp;quot;?,3093.123,2.102
Mr. Spicer: I think the President&amp;#39;s tweets,3095.225,1.468
stand for themselves.,3096.693,1.268
The Press: So he thinks he&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;bad (or sick) guy.&amp;quot;,3097.961,1.335
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m going to answer the question --,3099.296,1.368
"The Press: Okay, but you said it stood for itself,",3100.664,1.334
so I was asking.,3101.998,0.668
Mr. Spicer: I know.,3102.666,0.667
I think the President&amp;#39;s tweets speak for,3103.333,1.435
themselves.,3104.768,1.101
"As for the rest of the tweets, let&amp;#39;s see, as",3105.869,2.502
"we&amp;#39;ve mentioned before, how this process evolves",3108.371,2.036
and what information we can further gather up.,3110.407,1.535
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",3111.942,1.635
"On the executive order on energy independence,",3113.577,3.703
that&amp;#39;s been delayed for several weeks now.,3117.28,3.771
Can you --,3121.051,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Hold on, why would it be delayed?",3121.718,2.436
We never announced them.,3124.154,1.068
The Press: Your office said that it was going to,3125.222,2.702
be released several weeks ago.,3127.924,1.335
It wasn&amp;#39;t.,3129.259,0.667
And then there were reports consequently that,3129.926,1.869
"said it would be released, and it hasn&amp;#39;t been.",3131.795,2.402
So can you give us --,3134.197,0.668
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t --,3134.865,0.7
"with all due respect, I don&amp;#39;t believe I ever",3135.565,2.002
announced that that was scheduled to come out.,3137.567,2.369
The Press: Okay.,3139.936,1.168
Can you tell us when it will be released?,3141.104,3.504
Mr. Spicer: No.,3144.608,1.301
"The Press: And also, in it, it addresses the Clean",3145.909,4.338
"Power Plan, which is the Obama-era climate",3150.247,3.003
change regulation.,3153.25,0.967
And there is apparently no replacement opportunity,3154.217,2.403
in that executive order.,3156.62,0.967
Mr. Spicer: Can I just -- I&amp;#39;m going to,3157.587,1.535
cut you off here.,3159.122,0.801
We&amp;#39;ve discussed executive orders in the past.,3159.923,2.069
I&amp;#39;ve told before -- until they&amp;#39;re ready to be,3161.992,2.102
"announced, I don&amp;#39;t comment on the scheduling or the --",3164.094,1.902
The Press: This is a policy question --,3165.996,1.735
"Mr. Spicer: I know it is, but you&amp;#39;re asking",3167.731,1.334
me the contents of it.,3169.065,0.701
It&amp;#39;s not a policy question.,3169.766,0.667
"The Press: No, no, I just haven&amp;#39;t been able to",3170.433,1.335
finish my question.,3171.768,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Okay.,3172.435,0.968
The Press: Thank you.,3173.403,1.602
So apparently there&amp;#39;s no replacement for it.,3175.005,2.202
That is the answer to a Supreme Court,3177.207,2.569
ruling in 2007.,3179.776,1.268
Does the administration feel that it is legally,3181.044,3.403
bound to regulate greenhouse gases?,3184.447,2.103
Mr. Spicer: Let&amp;#39;s wait and see what the executive,3186.55,3.837
order says or doesn&amp;#39;t say.,3190.387,1.468
I don&amp;#39;t want to get into --,3191.855,1.768
The Press: (Inaudible.),3193.623,0.668
Mr. Spicer: I understand the question.,3194.291,1.334
I&amp;#39;m not getting ahead of this at this point.,3195.625,1.335
"The Press: Sean, will President Trump hold a",3196.96,1.335
news conference on the attack?,3198.295,1.334
"And also, on his upcoming travel, do you have any",3199.629,3.737
guidance on other rallies that he may have?,3203.366,2.203
Because that&amp;#39;s where he sends his message out to,3205.569,1.334
"the American people, including social media.",3206.903,1.368
Mr. Spicer: He sends his message out in a,3208.271,1.335
lot of ways.,3209.606,1.335
"If there are rallies, then I would refer you to the",3210.941,4.771
campaign website to get updates there.,3215.712,3.303
"As for future press conferences, stay tuned on",3219.015,3.804
when the next one is going to be.,3222.819,1.502
"The Press: Sean, when you learned that the members",3224.321,2.602
of the President&amp;#39;s team may have been in contact,3226.923,2.803
with someone who the intelligence community and,3229.726,2.135
"a federal judge has deemed to be a little bit dodgy,",3231.861,3.404
does that give you any pause at all?,3235.265,2.502
Mr. Spicer: Who are you referring to?,3237.767,3.037
The Press: The people who are subject to,3240.804,1.802
the FISA order.,3242.606,1.968
"Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sorry, can you rephrase the question?",3244.574,1.135
The Press: It&amp;#39;s a reference to Nunes.,3245.709,4.504
"Members of the President&amp;#39;s team, whether it&amp;#39;s the",3250.213,2.536
"transition or the campaign, are said to have",3252.749,2.102
been in contact -- being picked up by when they,3254.851,3.971
were in contact with someone who was the,3258.822,1.234
subject of a FISA order.,3260.056,1.769
Does that give you any pause at all given the,3261.825,2.202
things that you haven&amp;#39;t known before about,3264.027,2.803
"Manafort and Flynn, et cetera?",3266.83,2.235
Mr. Spicer: Not until we know further details.,3269.065,1.402
I think to get ahead of what we know -- until we,3270.467,4.137
"know what the chairman is going to brief him on, for",3274.604,2.669
me to suggest what he is going to reveal to him,3277.273,4.472
about whom and when and how would be,3281.745,3.67
"inappropriate, at this point, to comment on.",3285.415,1.435
I&amp;#39;m going to go to Elizabeth Crisp out of,3286.85,1.601
"Baton Rouge, Louisiana.",3288.451,3.837
"The Press: Hi, Sean, thanks.",3292.288,2.436
"Last year, Louisiana suffered one of the worst",3294.724,2.436
flooding disasters in our nation&amp;#39;s history.,3297.16,3.303
"Today, thousands of people remain displaced, and",3300.463,3.671
communities are struggling to rebuild.,3304.134,2.002
"With support from the Obama administration, the",3306.136,2.068
state received about $1.6 billion in flood,3308.204,6.34
assistance through the CDBG program.,3314.544,2.136
The state is seeking $2 billion more in federal,3316.68,3.336
"aid, and our governor has asked for",3320.016,3.07
President Trump&amp;#39;s support.,3323.086,1.335
So my question is twofold.,3324.421,2.202
What is the Trump administration&amp;#39;s position,3326.623,2.636
exactly on the federal government&amp;#39;s role in,3329.259,3.069
long-term disaster recovery efforts?,3332.328,1.769
"And also, can Louisiana count on this",3334.097,3.07
administration&amp;#39;s support for additional flood,3337.167,2.202
recovery assistance?,3339.369,0.901
"Mr. Spicer: Thanks, Elizabeth.",3340.27,1.735
I believe the process works such that the,3342.005,3.437
governor makes a request to FEMA; FEMA then puts it,3345.442,2.936
through the process.,3348.378,0.667
I&amp;#39;m not aware of what the request is or where it,3349.045,2.97
"stands in the process, and I would refer you back to",3352.015,3.57
FEMA on that.,3355.585,1.135
The Press: This is actually -- this is aid,3356.72,3.403
separate from FEMA.,3360.123,1.101
It&amp;#39;s the long-term part to this.,3361.224,2.269
Mr. Spicer: Okay.,3363.493,1.235
So I know that the budget that was just presented,3364.728,3.77
allows for substantial funding for humanitarian,3368.498,2.069
"assistance, including disaster refugee program",3370.567,2.969
funding in priority areas.,3373.536,2.203
I think at this point the budget process has just,3375.739,4.637
"kicked off, and we will now begin the process of",3380.376,3.571
"working with Congress on -- them draft a budget,",3383.947,2.335
and talk about our priorities and,3386.282,1.902
where they go forward.,3388.184,1.035
"The President will have a full budget out in May,",3389.219,2.035
and so that will be an,3393.723,0.834
appropriate time to do that.,3394.557,0.935
But I would refer you back to the governor at this,3395.492,2.936
"point, and figure out where that stands",3398.428,1.501
in the process.,3399.929,1.402
Cecilia.,3401.331,0.667
"The Press: Can you say today, with certainty,",3401.998,2.703
that Paul Manafort never tried to pressure or,3404.701,2.002
encourage the campaign to take on a more pro-Russia,3406.703,3.403
position on any issues?,3410.106,1.602
Mr. Spicer: Not that I&amp;#39;m aware of.,3411.708,1.735
I can&amp;#39;t -- but there&amp;#39;s nothing that suggests that,3413.443,2.636
that was the case.,3416.079,0.667
"The Press: And on Nunes, from what you know about",3416.746,3.07
"what he has said so far, is the White House viewing",3419.816,4.171
"this, in any way, as vindication of the",3423.987,3.804
President&amp;#39;s wiretapping tweets?,3427.791,1.401
Mr. Spicer: I would refer you to his,3429.192,2.202
comment specifically.,3431.394,0.968
Until we know what he is going to brief the,3432.362,2.803
"President on, I don&amp;#39;t want to have to",3435.165,1.835
get ahead of this.,3437,0.667
"I think, obviously, the suggestion that he made",3437.667,3.37
"that people were what they call &amp;quot;unmasked,&amp;quot; meaning",3441.037,3.504
that an American citizen who is caught up in a,3444.541,2.469
"surveillance has, by rule of law, has their name",3447.01,3.47
protected; the idea that individuals&amp;#39; names were,3450.48,4.438
unmasked and let known suggests -- raises serious,3454.918,4.504
questions: Why was that name unmasked?,3459.422,2.469
What was the intention of doing that?,3461.891,2.369
There&amp;#39;s a lot of questions that I think his statement,3464.26,2.57
"raises, and I hope that we can continue to get",3466.83,1.935
to the bottom of.,3468.765,0.967
"But right now, we just don&amp;#39;t --",3469.732,1.168
we&amp;#39;re not there yet.,3470.9,0.935
I think that there are a series of questions that,3471.835,3.703
"need to get answered as to what happened, why it",3475.538,2.136
"happened, and hopefully we will be able to share more",3477.674,4.905
with you going forward.,3482.579,1.268
Todd.,3483.847,0.667
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",3484.514,1.001
"On the border wall, the President&amp;#39;s budget",3485.515,3.77
blueprint calls for a couple of dozen lawyers,3489.285,2.703
who are going to be dedicated to,3491.988,2.536
acquiring land.,3494.524,0.734
And I think people are wondering just how,3495.258,2.102
aggressive the eminent domain effort is going to,3497.36,3.47
"be, and how that squares with respect for private",3500.83,2.536
property rights.,3503.366,0.834
"Mr. Spicer: As I recall, during the Bush",3504.2,2.67
administration similar efforts were undertaken to,3506.87,3.303
secure the appropriate property that would be,3510.173,3.537
"where a fence or a wall, in this case, would be.",3513.71,2.636
So this is nothing new.,3516.346,1.735
This is the government doing what it has to do to,3518.081,2.903
protect its border.,3520.984,1.434
"I think there&amp;#39;s nobody in America, and I daresay the",3522.418,3.404
"world, that didn&amp;#39;t believe that the President was",3525.822,2.235
committed to building a wall.,3528.057,1.735
And I think that we&amp;#39;re going to take the steps,3529.792,2.236
"necessary to fulfill that promise, to make",3532.028,2.336
sure that we have to.,3534.364,0.667
So I know that the steps are starting to be taken,3535.031,4.271
both in terms of the funding and the,3539.302,1.835
"administrative steps, to see the President&amp;#39;s vision",3541.137,1.502
fulfilled on this pledge that he made to,3542.639,2.235
the American people.,3544.874,0.734
And we&amp;#39;ll go from there.,3545.608,1.001
The Press: Is there any update on how the wall,3546.609,2.703
will be financed?,3549.312,0.901
Mr. Spicer: I think both the 2017 supplemental has,3550.213,5.072
some initial funding in it.,3555.285,1.501
"The 2018 budget does, and has two -- The Press: But",3556.786,2.669
that&amp;#39;s general.,3559.455,0.668
I&amp;#39;m talking about where the money will come from.,3560.123,1.334
Mr. Spicer: Right.,3561.457,0.701
And I think that we&amp;#39;re going to continue to do it.,3562.158,1.568
"Right now, the initial funding that was put in",3563.726,2.069
place will allow it to begin.,3565.795,1.535
The President has been very clear that using,3567.33,2.636
existing resources we&amp;#39;d go forward.,3569.966,1.735
There would be continuing discussions about the,3571.701,2.102
"financing of the wall, both in terms of how we",3573.803,2.369
will pay for it and who will be the source,3576.172,2.035
of that payment.,3578.207,1.335
The Press: Has he given up on Mexico paying for it?,3579.542,1.869
"Mr. Spicer: No, not at all.",3581.411,0.867
"Thank you guys, very much.",3582.278,1.135
I&amp;#39;ll see you tomorrow.,3583.413,0.5
We&amp;#39;ll try to have updates on the subjects that are,3583.913,1.935
currently pending.,3585.848,0.701
Thank you.,3586.549,0.3
