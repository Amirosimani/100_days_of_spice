"Mr. Spicer: Good afternoon, everybody.",0.7,3.103
"I want to start by acknowledging, as the",3.803,2.236
"President did a little while ago, that a great",6.039,2.536
"American, Kurt Cochran, was killed in the terror",8.575,2.702
attack in London yesterday.,11.277,1.869
Our prayers are with his family and friends.,13.146,3.203
We&amp;#39;re aware of reports that another American,16.349,2.302
"citizen was injured, as well as the potential as",18.651,3.17
this story continues to develop -- we stand ready,21.821,2.703
"to provide consular assistance, but",24.524,2.936
"considering some privacy concerns, I&amp;#39;m not going to",27.46,3.337
further discuss the current state of any of,30.797,2.903
those individuals at this time.,33.7,2.335
"As I said yesterday, the President spoke with UK",36.035,1.936
Prime Minister May to offer his condolences and,37.971,3.403
pledge the full cooperation and support of,41.374,1.702
the United States government in responding,43.076,2.169
to this attack and bringing those,45.245,1.334
responsible to justice.,46.579,2.236
"Now, a little bit on today&amp;#39;s schedule.",48.815,1.468
"This morning, after receiving his daily",50.283,1.869
"intelligence briefing, the President met with over 30",52.152,2.502
members of the House Freedom Caucus to discuss,54.654,2.035
building momentum towards replacing and repealing,56.689,2.837
Obamacare with the American Health Care Act.,59.526,2.869
The members of the Freedom Caucus thanked the,62.395,1.468
President for engaging with them throughout their,63.863,1.936
"negotiations, and the President, likewise,",65.799,2.469
thanked the group for their willingness to work,68.268,1.768
closely with the White House and their colleagues,70.036,2.202
to craft the strongest possible bill.,72.238,2.369
The group agreed that their ultimate goal is to,74.607,1.836
implement a system that will drive down costs and,76.443,1.868
increase access to healthcare for millions of,78.311,2.469
"Americans, and this meeting was, I think, a",80.78,2.169
very positive step towards achieving that goal.,82.949,2.669
This was just the latest in a series of,85.618,3.003
"discussions, in-person and on the phone, that the",88.621,2.403
"President, the Vice President and his team",91.024,2.302
"have had, holding with Republican House members",93.326,3.57
on the American Health Care Act.,96.896,2.236
"This afternoon, we expect the President to continue",99.132,2.836
those meetings with members of the Tuesday,101.968,2.302
"Group from the House,",104.27,1.168
coming up here later today.,105.438,1.769
"Since the law was introduced, the",107.207,1.368
legislative affairs team has been in constant,108.575,1.868
contact with members the American people will be,110.443,2.603
counting on to fulfill their promise of repealing,113.046,2.536
and replacing Obamacare by supporting this,115.582,3.236
bill later tonight.,118.818,1.502
"In the past few days, the President has been on the",120.32,2.969
"phone with scores of Republican members, in",123.289,1.335
addition to the in-persons meetings you&amp;#39;ve seen with,124.624,1.768
"the Republican Study Committee, the House",126.392,2.67
Freedom Caucus and the Tuesday Group.,129.062,2.502
This bill has truly been a collaborative effort,131.564,2.269
from the beginning.,133.833,1.068
"Through an open and deliberative process, the",134.901,1.969
President and his team have helped to negotiate a,136.87,2.736
"very, very strong bill.",139.606,1.902
He was on the phone last night well into the 11,141.508,3.436
"o&amp;#39;clock hour with members on an individual basis,",144.944,2.536
discussing their support for the bill.,147.48,3.404
The amendments that have been incorporated add,150.884,1.701
"important aspects to the bill, like removing costly",152.585,3.804
&amp;quot;essential health benefit&amp;quot; insurance regulations;,156.389,2.769
"repealing Obamacare taxes immediately, starting in",159.158,2.536
2017; reforming Medicaid by allowing states to,161.694,3.404
accept funding as a block grant to implement,165.098,2.269
able-bodied work requirements; and blocking,167.367,2.402
states from receiving enhanced Federal Medical,169.769,1.902
Assistance Percentages if,171.671,1.568
they expanded during the transition.,173.239,2.236
"We&amp;#39;ve already seen the results, with many members",175.475,2.269
coming out and saying they&amp;#39;re going to be,177.744,1.434
a &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; tonight.,179.178,1.602
"As I&amp;#39;ve noted before, today is actually the 7th",180.78,2.336
"-- and we hope, the last -- anniversary of the day",183.116,2.936
that President Obama signed Obamacare.,186.052,2.536
The President is looking forward to seeing,188.588,1.635
Republicans fulfill the pledge tonight that,190.223,2.235
they&amp;#39;ve been making to their constituents for,192.458,1.635
"years that, with a Republican in the White",194.093,2.336
"House and with them in Congress, they would once",196.429,1.935
and for all see the end of Obamacare.,198.364,2.836
The President -- I assume that President Obama must,201.2,2.67
"be feeling this time is up for his signature law,",203.87,3.603
since today he came out with a rather lengthy,207.473,1.769
statement about it.,209.242,0.667
But he can&amp;#39;t change the facts about,209.909,2.436
where it stands.,212.345,1.134
President Obama stated that Americans received an,213.479,2.336
&amp;quot;upgrade&amp;quot; in insurance.,215.815,1.702
But the mandates Obamacare placed on insurance forced,217.517,2.669
millions off their insurance and away from,220.186,2.269
"their doctor, which broke the promise",222.455,2.202
that they were given.,224.657,1.635
President Obama attempted to move the goal posts on,226.292,2.236
"costs, downplaying the skyrocketing premiums,",228.528,3.136
some in the case of over 100 percent in some,231.664,2.269
"places, and unaffordable deductibles.",233.933,3.037
Americans -- he seems to have forgotten that he,236.97,2.369
"pushed Obamacare on the promise of reducing costs,",239.339,2.936
not making health care unaffordable.,242.275,2.469
President Obama said Obamacare isn&amp;#39;t -- quote,244.744,1.902
-- in a &amp;quot;death spiral.&amp;quot;,246.646,1.501
"But enrollment is nowhere near expectations,",248.147,2.536
and this year it&amp;#39;s actually declining.,250.683,2.002
Insurers are fleeing the exchanges and one in three,252.685,2.469
counties in America only has one insurer.,255.154,4.605
President Obama may not believe the Obamacare is a,259.759,2.102
"&amp;quot;job-killer&amp;quot; but the new law, including its",261.861,2.536
"job-killing taxes, mandates and regulations,",264.397,2.502
speaks for itself.,266.899,1.368
"With the passage of the American Health Care Act,",268.267,1.869
we will begin the process of rolling back,270.136,2.135
Obamacare&amp;#39;s many disastrous policies.,272.271,2.67
"And, of course, it&amp;#39;s not just a big day",274.941,1.334
on the House side.,276.275,1.168
"Over on the Senate, we begin the final and fourth",277.443,2.169
day of Judge Gorsuch&amp;#39;s Senate Judiciary hearings.,279.612,3.47
"Earlier today, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck",283.082,2.636
Schumer announced that Senate Democrats would be,285.718,2.436
mounting a filibuster against his nomination.,288.154,2.703
"From day one, we&amp;#39;ve said that the President made an",290.857,1.835
inspired choice with the nomination,292.692,1.535
of Judge Gorsuch.,294.227,1.435
The American Bar Association has given them,295.662,2.969
their highest rating of &amp;quot;well qualified.&amp;quot;,298.631,2.369
"This week, though, through all four days, he has",301,2.136
showcased his sterling credentials and a,303.136,2.235
brilliant legal mind.,305.371,1.669
We find Senator Schumer&amp;#39;s announcement truly,307.04,1.835
"disappointing, because it breaks with the tradition",308.875,2.302
of how the Senate has handled Supreme Court,311.177,2.269
confirmation votes in modern time -- and,313.446,2.436
represents the type of partisanship that,315.882,2.335
Americans have grown tired of.,318.217,1.869
"In the last half-century, only three Supreme Court",320.086,2.302
justices have ever faced a filibuster.,322.388,2.336
The most recent -- Justice Alito -- was opposed by,324.724,3.403
then-Senator Obama who voted to uphold his,328.127,2.536
"filibuster, and later admitted that his vote was",330.663,2.569
a politically motivated act that he regretted.,333.232,3.237
"In fact, Senate Republicans didn&amp;#39;t",336.469,1.868
"filibuster his Supreme Court nominees,",338.337,2.403
Kagan and Sotomayor.,340.74,2.002
We call on Senator Schumer to follow Democrats to,342.742,2.703
abandon this attempt to block Judge Gorsuch from,345.445,3.203
receiving a fair up or down vote that he and,348.648,3.036
the American people have voted for.,351.684,2.336
Back to the rest of the President&amp;#39;s schedule.,354.02,1.668
"This afternoon, the President, as I mentioned,",355.688,1.635
will meet with members of the Tuesday Group.,357.323,2.002
He had lunch with Secretary of the Treasury,359.325,2.102
Mnuchin and Nelson Peltz.,361.427,1.769
At 3 o&amp;#39;clock today we hope you&amp;#39;ll come out and join,363.196,3.503
the President to welcome the truck drivers and,366.699,2.369
truck company CEOs who he will be meeting with on,369.068,4.204
the American Health Care Act as they arrive to the,373.272,2.036
White House alongside two rather large big-rigs.,375.308,3.57
One in every 16 Americans work for the,378.878,2.069
trucking industry.,380.947,0.901
It&amp;#39;s the backbone of our country&amp;#39;s domestic freight,381.848,2.168
transportation and it moves over 70 percent of,384.016,2.67
domestic freight tonnage.,386.686,1.535
But the trucking industry has suffered,388.221,1.334
greatly under Obamacare.,389.555,1.735
Many truckers were forced to buy healthcare plans,391.29,2.203
that weren&amp;#39;t necessarily right for them,393.493,1.701
on the exchanges.,395.194,1.335
"Like millions of Americans across the country, they",396.529,1.868
saw their premiums rise and their options plummet.,398.397,2.937
"And trucking companies, classified as large",401.334,1.968
"employers under the law, are mandated to provide",403.302,2.036
insurance that we already know doesn&amp;#39;t work.,405.338,3.403
Instead of imposing senseless restrictions,408.741,2.336
"from Washington, the President&amp;#39;s three-pronged",411.077,2.269
healthcare reform plan will lower premiums and,413.346,2.436
increase choice by increasing competition.,415.782,3.403
The President looks forward to discussing how,419.185,1.435
"these policies, combined with forthcoming tax,",420.62,2.802
"regulatory and trade reforms, will provide much",423.422,3.237
needed relief for the trucking industry.,426.659,2.402
"Also today, the Vice President met with",429.061,1.635
President Hernandez of Honduras.,430.696,1.969
A readout on that meeting is available from the Vice,432.665,2.836
President&amp;#39;s office.,435.501,1.268
And a few notes before I get to your questions.,436.769,3.337
As the President noted during his first Cabinet,440.106,1.868
"meeting earlier this month, while many of his",441.974,2.136
spectacularly qualified choices to lead his,444.11,1.868
departments and agencies are already in place and,445.978,2.436
taking action to fulfill the President&amp;#39;s ambitious,448.414,2.302
"agenda, there are still some important positions",450.716,2.503
"that have not been filled, in large part to to Senate",453.219,2.502
Democrats&amp;#39; obstruction.,455.721,1.602
I wanted to give you a quick update on still some,457.323,1.768
of the outstanding confirmations.,459.091,2.103
Secretary of Labor-designate Alex,461.194,2.202
Acosta had a very successful hearing,463.396,1.501
"yesterday, and we expect markup next week.",464.897,3.337
"Secretary of Agriculture-designate,",468.234,1.768
former governor Sonny Perdue is currently,470.002,1.735
appearing before the Senate Ag Committee.,471.737,2.036
We expect Governor Perdue to continue to show why,473.773,2.335
"he&amp;#39;s the best choice to lead the USDA, and",476.108,2.436
hopefully his markup to be scheduled in,478.544,1.602
the coming days.,480.146,1.468
We also announced earlier this afternoon that Prime,481.614,2.336
Minister Rasmussen of Denmark will be visiting,483.95,2.202
the White House on March 30th.,486.152,1.802
We&amp;#39;ll have further details on the visit in the,487.954,1.668
upcoming days.,489.622,0.667
"Tomorrow, the President will hose Medal of Honor",490.289,3.671
recipients and their guests in celebration of,493.96,2.235
"Medal of Honor Day, which falls on Saturday",496.195,2.736
of this year.,498.931,1.101
We&amp;#39;ll have some more details on that event,500.032,2.469
coming forward.,502.501,0.735
"The President intends to be here this weekend, so",503.236,3.269
as we have updates on the President&amp;#39;s weekend plans,506.505,2.903
we will let you know as well.,509.408,0.868
I&amp;#39;ll also note that we&amp;#39;ve got -- coming up on a,510.276,3.236
deadline related to the Keystone pipeline.,513.512,2.37
We&amp;#39;ll have an update on that for you tomorrow.,515.882,2.635
"And finally, I&amp;#39;m proud to announce that on April",518.517,2.703
"19th, the anniversary of the Battles of Lexington",521.22,3.07
"and Concord, the New England Patriots will be",524.29,2.603
visiting the White House to celebrate their latest,526.893,3.069
-- and what will probably be a continuation of many,529.962,2.303
more to come -- Super Bowl win.,532.265,2.335
"And with that, I will take your questions.",534.6,2.67
Jeff Mason.,537.27,0.667
The Press: Sean --,537.937,1.335
The Press: This is a Patriot question.,539.272,1.768
(Laughter.),541.04,0.667
"The Press: No, it&amp;#39;s not.",541.707,0.868
(Laughter.),542.575,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Do you know anything about Tom Brady&amp;#39;s jersey?,543.242,1.902
Is this --,545.144,1.135
The Press: I&amp;#39;ve got nothing on that.,546.279,2.602
But I have a healthcare question for you.,548.881,1.335
"First, do you expect there to be a vote tonight?",550.216,2.302
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s what I understand the House,552.518,2.269
"has scheduled, yes.",554.787,0.667
The Press: Any chance that that&amp;#39;s going to,555.454,1.368
be pushed back?,556.822,0.668
Mr. Spicer: That would be obviously up to Speaker,557.49,3.036
"Ryan and Leader McCarthy, but I have been -- nothing",560.526,2.77
leads me to believe that that&amp;#39;s the case.,563.296,1.468
The Press: Is the President concerned at all,564.764,1.968
that as he draws support for the bill from the,566.732,2.636
Freedom Caucus that he may lose support from more,569.368,2.403
moderate groups of the House?,571.771,1.368
Mr. Spicer: He&amp;#39;s meeting with members of the,573.139,1.902
Tuesday Group today.,575.041,1.268
Obviously this is something that he,576.309,1.601
understands -- there&amp;#39;s a little bit of a balancing,577.91,1.902
act that goes on as you try to get 216,579.812,2.402
in this case.,582.214,0.768
But I think we continue to make progress every day.,582.982,3.603
We walked out with more members in support of the,586.585,3.237
American Health Care Act today than we started the,589.822,2.803
"day with, and I continue to see that number",592.625,1.535
climb hour by hour.,594.16,2.068
And I anticipate that we will get there.,596.228,1.936
Blake.,598.164,0.667
"The Press: Sean, Patrick McHenry said &amp;quot;we have an",598.831,2.169
offer that&amp;quot; -- speaking of the House Freedom Caucus,601,2.869
-- &amp;quot;can accept it or reject it.&amp;quot;,603.869,1.735
Is that the way that you see it at this moment?,605.604,2.536
Are you just waiting on the House Freedom Caucus,608.14,1.936
to come to your side?,610.076,1.835
Are you at their whims at this point?,611.911,2.936
What&amp;#39;s their status as far as you know?,614.847,1.568
"Mr. Spicer: I think there are some members who, in",616.415,2.102
"the meeting, stood up and told the President,",618.517,2.136
I&amp;#39;m with you now.,620.653,1.101
"And I think member by member, that&amp;#39;s how",621.754,1.702
they&amp;#39;re going to vote.,623.456,2.269
I think we&amp;#39;ve continued to see that number rise.,625.725,3.036
And the same thing with the Tuesday Group.,628.761,1.768
There are members that had not been with us that are,630.529,3.003
expressing their willingness to want,633.532,1.635
to be part of this.,635.167,1.168
The President went over several commitments and,636.335,1.969
changes that had been made to assuage different folks,638.304,4.905
"that have continued to evolve, and I think that",643.209,2.302
we continue to see the number rise.,645.511,1.335
But I think that we continue to see the number,646.846,2.536
"go up not down, and that&amp;#39;s a very positive sign.",649.382,2.402
The Press: Do you know how many came across and what,651.784,2.402
it was that brought them across in that meeting?,654.186,1.969
Mr. Spicer: It depends.,656.155,1.001
"Again, I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s any singular issue",657.156,2.636
in a lot of cases.,659.792,0.801
There&amp;#39;s a lot -- I think we talked a little bit,660.593,4.104
about sections of the bill that there was,664.697,6.606
an issue with.,671.303,2.937
And so I think there&amp;#39;s a couple areas that there is,674.24,2.369
some common ground on.,676.609,0.834
"But there was over 30 members there today, and",677.443,2.669
some of them had specific aspects that they wanted,680.112,3.837
"to see improved, and some of them, frankly, came to",683.949,2.77
"say, hey, thank you, I think that what you guys",686.719,2.135
have done already has been an improvement.,688.854,1.468
The Press: With them is it essential health benefits?,690.322,2.336
Is that their main sticking point,692.658,1.335
as far as you know?,693.993,0.7
Mr. Spicer: In a lot of cases -- there were some,694.693,1.469
members that that was their number-one thing.,696.162,1.801
"But, again, it wasn&amp;#39;t universal across the board.",697.963,2.002
"But, again, I think some of the measures that have",699.965,4.138
"been taken along the way have really -- and again,",704.103,2.803
"there&amp;#39;s also, beyond that, there&amp;#39;s a lot of",706.906,2.802
"discussion about phase two and phase three, and I",709.708,3.137
think the President and the Vice President both,712.845,2.002
committed to continuing working and improving and,714.847,3.937
making commitments on the totality and the,718.784,2.269
comprehensive nature of how we&amp;#39;re going,721.053,1.435
to do this.,722.488,0.934
For a lot of these guys it really comes down to,723.422,1.535
premium increases.,724.957,0.901
They&amp;#39;re very concerned about what they&amp;#39;re seeing,725.858,1.568
their constituents face.,727.426,1.101
"And I think the President and the Vice President,",728.527,2.536
"Secretary Price, Director Mulvaney, Reince Priebus,",731.063,4.405
"the chief of staff, the legislative affairs team",735.468,3.67
-- we&amp;#39;re all continuing to work with them to talk,739.138,1.702
about certain measures that have been put in,740.84,2.669
place to drive down cost.,743.509,1.401
And I think when you realize what we continue,744.91,3.27
"to talk about, that costs are too high, premiums are",748.18,3.003
"spiking, deductibles are going up, choices are",751.183,1.702
going down -- these are real concerns for,752.885,3.437
constituents of these members.,756.322,1.168
And I think that as they see an overall and total,757.49,3.069
"commitment of this, it&amp;#39;s making them feel a lot",760.559,3.17
"better about not just this bill, but phases",763.729,2.87
two and three.,766.599,0.667
Matt.,767.266,0.667
"The Press: Two questions, both on healthcare.",767.933,2.303
First one -- is the President open to removing,770.236,3.47
protections for preexisting conditions,773.706,1.535
from the bill?,775.241,1.134
Mr. Spicer: I think that&amp;#39;s been something that he&amp;#39;s,776.375,2.136
been very clear needs to stay in there.,778.511,2.902
The Press: Okay.,781.413,1.268
"Secondly, about this essential benefits protection.",782.681,2.536
Obviously among those is maternity leave.,785.217,2.603
So how would removing that jive with the President&amp;#39;s,787.82,2.969
promise during the campaign to expand,790.789,2.536
maternity leave?,793.325,0.868
Obviously this would take it out and insurers would,794.193,2.803
no longer have to provide that.,796.996,0.934
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, and again, I don&amp;#39;t want to get",797.93,1.802
"into a benefit-by-benefit discussion here, but I",799.732,3.003
"think that there&amp;#39;s a lot of concerns, as I just",802.735,2.102
"said to Blake, that part of the reason that",804.837,2.969
premiums have spiked out of control is because,807.806,3.571
under Obamacare there were these mandated services,811.377,3.069
that had to be included.,814.446,1.502
"And what happened was is that older men, older",815.948,3.136
women who had gone past maternity age were buying,819.084,2.47
benefits that weren&amp;#39;t necessary for them.,821.554,3.269
People who were at the younger end of the age,824.823,3.471
scale were buying end-of-life benefits.,828.294,2.769
And I think this goes back to the nut of this,831.063,2.703
"discussion, Matt, which is we have now gone down to a",833.766,2.936
system where in one-third of all counties there&amp;#39;s,836.702,2.469
"one choice, and it&amp;#39;s this potpourri of mandated",839.171,3.537
benefits that everyone has to have.,842.708,2.269
We&amp;#39;ve lost consumer choice.,844.977,2.135
And so people are paying for benefits that neither,847.112,2.136
"they, their spouse, their family needs, which is",849.248,2.836
driving up costs for everybody.,852.084,2.035
And so part of it isn&amp;#39;t about necessarily a benefit.,854.119,3.971
It&amp;#39;s about a series of benefits being,858.09,2.169
mandated for everybody.,860.259,1.969
And so what has happened is that the costs of,862.228,3.336
healthcare for every individual has gone up and,865.564,2.136
the choice has gone down.,867.7,1.568
And I think there is a philosophical discussion,869.268,2.035
that is going on about what we can do to make,871.303,2.536
sure that people have actual coverage --,873.839,2.302
something that we&amp;#39;ve talked about before -- but,876.141,2.036
doing so in a way that doesn&amp;#39;t drive up the,878.177,2.002
cost for everybody.,880.179,0.734
The Press: So one follow-up on that then.,880.913,2.202
Is the President concerned that without having those,883.115,2.536
"essential benefits in there, he&amp;#39;ll have a",885.651,1.768
situation where women are just de factor paying,887.419,2.469
higher for health insurance?,889.888,1.502
Obviously they&amp;#39;d be paying for maternity leave.,891.39,1.869
"Mr. Spicer: No, you could have a family plan.",893.259,1.901
"In other words, the point is, is that it&amp;#39;s not --",895.16,2.069
"again, you&amp;#39;re picking one benefit and trying",897.229,1.335
to extrapolate it.,898.564,0.667
It&amp;#39;s also saying should young people have to pay,899.231,1.368
for end-of-life care.,900.599,0.668
The idea is to instill choice back into the,901.267,1.334
market so that it&amp;#39;s not just about one particular,902.601,1.335
"benefit, it&amp;#39;s allowing people to tailor a plan",903.936,1.335
and a cost point that&amp;#39;s good for them or their,905.271,1.768
family or them and their spouse.,907.039,2.169
"But it&amp;#39;s not just about one particular benefit,",909.208,2.836
it&amp;#39;s about looking at this and figuring out what are,912.044,1.335
the cost drivers and how do we give people the,913.379,1.334
choice that they need.,914.713,0.701
Sara.,915.414,0.667
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",916.081,0.668
The White House and House leadership initially,916.749,5.472
defended the way this bill was written by saying it,922.221,4.971
needed to be structured a certain way and exclude,930.562,6.073
certain things to be able to proceed through the,936.635,2.97
Senate through budget reconciliation.,939.605,1.368
So what&amp;#39;s changed to put now these pretty,940.973,2.769
substantive policy changes on the table?,943.742,2.069
What&amp;#39;s given the White House and Republicans,945.811,2.402
confidence that now it can survive through that same,948.213,3.104
process in the Senate?,951.317,1.368
Mr. Spicer: I think there&amp;#39;s a lot of,952.685,1.635
discussion that goes on.,954.32,1.768
"Without getting too into it, the issue at hand is",956.088,3.237
the Byrd Rule and whether or not it affects the,959.325,2.736
budgetary -- you can&amp;#39;t have policymaking things,962.061,2.435
that don&amp;#39;t have a budgetary impact.,964.496,2.636
There are certain things that are being phrased in,967.132,1.902
certain ways and crafted in accordance,969.034,3.237
with the rule.,972.271,0.834
But there&amp;#39;s a lot of smart people that are very,973.105,2.936
familiar with the rules and are trying to do,976.041,1.669
things in a way to make this bill conform,977.71,3.603
in those ways.,981.313,1.869
Zeke.,983.182,0.667
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",983.849,0.667
Two questions for you.,984.516,0.668
One on the healthcare bill first.,985.184,1.368
A question about the way this bill is now being,986.552,4.371
modified to basically pick up votes.,990.923,2.202
On Monday night the amendment included that,993.125,5.005
special carve-out for upstate New York -- had a,1000.599,2.236
bunch of good nicknames that I can&amp;#39;t do justice,1002.835,2.235
for -- but they also announced these latest,1005.07,1.969
(inaudible.) Is the President concerned that,1007.039,1.601
"this bill now looks a lot like -- procedurally, it",1008.64,2.737
looks a lot like what Obamacare looked like,1011.377,1.835
seven years ago that Republicans have spent,1013.212,1.401
seven years criticizing the way that bill was,1014.613,1.602
"brought to the floor, and here they are seven years",1016.215,1.968
later on the same day about to do the,1018.183,1.802
exact same thing?,1019.985,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: No, not at all.",1020.652,1.102
"In fact, it&amp;#39;s doing exactly what we",1021.754,1.635
intended to do.,1023.389,0.667
"I mean, the exchange that we had with Matt, it&amp;#39;s",1024.056,2.669
actually going -- the two goals that it set out to,1026.725,3.437
"do it&amp;#39;s actually doing -- driving costs down, find",1030.162,2.97
"ways to lower premiums, keep deductibles within",1033.132,2.102
"reason, or at least giving people the option to",1035.234,1.668
"choose a plan that fits their budget, and then,",1036.902,1.969
"secondly, is doing things that instill competition,",1038.871,2.402
choice.,1041.273,1.168
So the things that are being done actually,1042.441,3.136
achieve the goals that have been set forth.,1045.577,2.436
"The Press: Sean, just one for you on a",1048.013,3.003
different question.,1051.016,0.667
"Yesterday, Secretary Mattis and Chairman",1051.683,1.702
Dunford testified on Capitol Hill that they,1053.385,2.336
"were willing to, before Congress, have a public",1055.721,2.703
debate around a new AUMF.,1058.424,1.668
"Is that something that -- traditionally, those have",1060.092,2.703
started in the executive branch.,1062.795,1.668
Is the White House willing to put one forward and,1064.463,3.37
willing to begin that round of discussions?,1067.833,2.369
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;d refer you back to Secretary Mattis.,1070.202,2.803
I think that that is one that&amp;#39;s the Department of,1073.005,1.601
Defense is -- The Press: So is that statement,1074.606,3.971
"operative for the White House, that the White",1078.577,1.335
House now is calling --,1079.912,1.101
"Mr. Spicer: No, I think",1081.013,1.535
that that was brought up in the context of a,1082.548,2.602
conversation that he is willing to have with,1085.15,2.069
respect to overseas contingencies that are,1087.219,3.437
"existing right now in the battle, especially with",1090.656,2.235
"respect to ISIS, and the current tools that",1092.891,2.703
we have to combat them.,1095.594,1.802
But I think that was a discussion about whether,1097.396,2.335
or not we should have a discussion on authorized,1099.731,2.47
"use of force or not, and how to have that.",1102.201,2.636
Jim.,1104.837,0.867
The Press: Now that Chuck Schumer has announced a,1105.704,4.338
"definite filibuster of Judge Neil Gorsuch, do you",1110.042,3.103
think it&amp;#39;s time for the White House to take a,1113.145,3.904
stand on eliminating the filibuster for Supreme,1117.049,2.702
Court nominees?,1119.751,0.801
Mr. Spicer: I am not going to -- I&amp;#39;ll let -- Senator,1120.552,3.837
McConnell is a much more apt user and understanding,1124.389,5.306
of the Senate rules.,1129.695,1.067
I&amp;#39;m not going to start to tell Senator McConnell,1130.762,2.737
what he should be doing from here.,1133.499,2.168
"The Press: He&amp;#39;s your nominee, and --",1135.667,1.368
Mr. Spicer: I understand that.,1137.035,0.968
And it&amp;#39;s his rules and his chamber that he leads.,1138.003,2.836
So I&amp;#39;m going to let that -- John.,1140.839,1.735
"The Press: Sean, thank you.",1142.574,2.336
Has anybody from the national security team or,1144.91,2.336
the homeland security folks been in touch with,1147.246,3.303
their counterparts in London in the last,1150.549,1.902
24 hours or so?,1152.451,1.234
Mr. Spicer: Yes.,1153.685,0.668
The Press: Can you expound on that at all?,1154.353,2.369
Mr. Spicer: Only to the extent to say that they&amp;#39;ve,1156.722,4.971
"been in touch to evaluate, offer assistance.",1161.693,3.17
"And again, I&amp;#39;m not going to get into a classified",1164.863,2.67
discussion about what we may or may,1167.533,1.835
not be discussing.,1169.368,0.667
The Press: A supportive effort needless to say.,1170.035,1.502
Mr. Spicer: Yes.,1171.537,1.101
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1172.638,0.967
Chairman Nunes today refused to definitively,1173.605,2.169
rule out that he received the information he,1175.774,2.836
"announced yesterday on surveillance, that he got",1178.61,2.536
that from the White House.,1181.146,1.769
So will you rule out that the White House or anyone,1182.915,3.937
in the Trump administration gave,1186.852,1.802
Chairman Nunes that information?,1188.654,1.434
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know what he actually briefed,1190.088,2.503
"the President on, but I don&amp;#39;t know why he would",1192.591,1.601
come up to brief the President on something,1194.192,1.369
that we gave him.,1195.561,0.667
"The Press: Well, that&amp;#39;s why it was confusing to",1196.228,1.335
"many of us, so I was wondering --",1197.563,1.334
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know that that makes sense.,1198.897,1.335
I did not sit in on that briefing.,1200.232,1.501
I&amp;#39;m not -- it just doesn&amp;#39;t -- so I don&amp;#39;t know why he,1201.733,5.773
would brief the Speaker and then come down here to,1207.506,1.701
brief us on something that we would have,1209.207,2.536
briefed him on.,1211.743,0.668
It doesn&amp;#39;t really seem to make a ton of sense.,1212.411,2.536
"So I&amp;#39;m not aware of it, but it doesn&amp;#39;t really",1214.947,2.469
pass the smell test.,1217.416,1.568
Hallie.,1218.984,0.667
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1219.651,0.834
"On healthcare, a couple for you.",1220.485,1.368
Mark Meadows says -- came out of a meeting and,1221.853,1.936
said there is no deal.,1223.789,1.101
Does the President acknowledge that this bill,1224.89,1.568
appears to be in trouble right now?,1226.458,1.568
"Mr. Spicer: No, I think that we&amp;#39;re going to",1228.026,1.769
"continue -- I mean, it&amp;#39;s not a question of trouble.",1229.795,1.601
There was no deal.,1231.396,0.701
We weren&amp;#39;t asking for a deal.,1232.097,1.068
The President --,1233.165,0.667
The Press: You wouldn&amp;#39;t call,1233.832,0.768
the essential health benefits package a deal?,1234.6,1.801
"Mr. Spicer: No, I think for a lot of",1236.401,1.335
members it was.,1237.736,0.667
"And I think some of them stood up and said,",1238.403,1.335
"Mr. President, we&amp;#39;re with you.",1239.738,1.235
"I think a lot of them said, we&amp;#39;re going to go",1240.973,2.002
back and think about it.,1242.975,0.8
But there was no -- the meeting didn&amp;#39;t conclude by,1243.775,2.87
"saying, &amp;quot;do we have a deal?&amp;quot;",1246.645,1.768
That&amp;#39;s not why we had it.,1248.413,1.035
I think for some members this has been --,1249.448,1.735
The Press: No final offer before it is --,1251.183,1.701
"Mr. Spicer: No, I think this was a discussion that",1252.884,1.902
the President continues to have.,1254.786,1.335
"I think we have been very, very pleased with the",1256.121,1.768
direction it&amp;#39;s going in and the number of members,1257.889,1.736
who have expressed their support for it.,1259.625,2.068
We&amp;#39;ll continue that discussion with,1261.693,1.335
the Tuesday Group.,1263.028,0.667
"But the number is growing, the number of members who",1263.695,5.139
"have shared concerns, and I think that we have been",1268.834,4.337
"very responsive, as well as Speaker Ryan, to the",1273.171,3.103
concerns and ideas that members have expressed,1276.274,3.504
from across the spectrum.,1279.778,0.968
The Press: Two quick clarifications.,1280.746,1.334
You said that there&amp;#39;s only plan A.,1282.08,1.769
"At this point, is there an acknowledgement that",1283.849,3.336
perhaps there does need to be a plan B if this vote,1287.185,2.236
doesn&amp;#39;t happen tonight?,1289.421,0.667
Mr. Spicer: No.,1290.088,0.668
Plan A.,1290.756,0.667
"The Press: Okay, then the next follow-up is just,",1291.423,1.335
has the President asked Speaker Ryan to delay this,1292.758,1.801
vote while he works with some of these members to,1294.559,2.369
try to convince them to come on board.,1296.928,1.902
"Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sorry, what&amp;#39;s that?",1298.83,1.435
The Press: Did the President asked Speaker Ryan --,1300.265,2.136
Mr. Spicer: No.,1302.401,0.7
The Press: -- to delay the vote?,1303.101,1.669
Mr. Spicer: Steven.,1304.77,0.7
The Press: I was going to offer you the opportunity,1305.47,2.369
to respond to what Leader Pelosi said today.,1307.839,1.902
She said that it&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;rookie mistake&amp;quot; to set a,1309.741,2.369
date for a bill before there&amp;#39;s consensus from,1312.11,1.902
the Republican caucus.,1314.012,0.734
What&amp;#39;s your response to that?,1314.746,1.168
Mr. Spicer: Thank you.,1315.914,0.968
I appreciate that.,1316.882,0.7
I think we have a pretty strong record on the,1317.582,2.369
"Republican side of getting bills passed,",1319.951,1.936
getting things done.,1321.887,1.802
And so -- I know that they have a pretty strong,1323.689,4.004
record of passing things and telling people that,1327.693,2.135
they can read the bill afterwards.,1329.828,1.335
"I think we have done this the right way, and I think",1331.163,2.769
-- we know that we&amp;#39;ve done it with the support that,1333.932,3.604
voters told members and the President,1337.536,2.169
that they wanted.,1339.705,0.7
Jonathan.,1340.405,0.668
"The Press: And related, if I might.",1341.073,1.334
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, of course.",1342.407,1.435
The Press: There are some former White House lawyers,1343.842,2.97
who served in the prior administration who say,1346.812,2.602
that by tweeting from his official POTUS account,1349.414,2.603
this morning a video that was put out on official,1352.017,3.27
"social media channels, that the President and the",1355.287,2.636
White House have violated the anti-lobbying law,1357.923,2.269
because they&amp;#39;re using money that was,1360.192,1.968
appropriated by Congress.,1362.16,1.201
Is that a concern you guys appreciate?,1363.361,1.335
Is that something that&amp;#39;s been talked about here?,1364.696,1.335
Mr. Spicer: It is not.,1366.031,0.667
The President -- that is not applicable to the,1366.698,1.635
"President, no.",1368.333,0.701
So there is no -- I believe you&amp;#39;re,1369.034,1.334
referring to 18 U.S.,1370.368,0.668
"Code 1913, if I&amp;#39;m correct.",1371.036,0.667
(Laughter.),1371.703,0.667
I think we&amp;#39;re pretty good on it.,1372.37,1.335
Jonathan.,1373.705,0.667
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1374.372,6.607
The President wrote a book called &amp;quot;The Art of the,1380.979,1.802
Deal.&amp;quot; He&amp;#39;s considered the ultimate closer when,1382.781,1.802
it comes to negotiations.,1384.583,1.034
"If this deal falls through, if this bill does",1385.617,2.302
"not pass, would he accept the blame for its failure?",1387.919,2.469
"And if not, who would?",1390.388,1.669
Mr. Spicer: Let&amp;#39;s get to the vote tonight.,1392.057,2.302
I&amp;#39;m not going to start -- I think the President has,1394.359,2.403
"done a phenomenal job, there&amp;#39;s no question.",1396.762,1.835
And I think when you look at the effort that he&amp;#39;s,1398.597,1.902
"put in, the number of meetings that he&amp;#39;s had,",1400.499,1.935
"and the changes that have been made to the bill,",1402.434,1.635
there&amp;#39;s no question how hard the President and his,1404.069,1.935
"team, the Vice President",1406.004,1.435
have worked to get this done.,1407.439,2.969
And it&amp;#39;s in response -- at the end of the day we,1410.408,1.669
"can&amp;#39;t force somebody to vote, but I think, as I",1412.077,2.436
"mentioned to Hallie and several other folks, I",1414.513,2.602
like the direction that this thing is going.,1417.115,1.735
I think that we continue to see support go with us.,1418.85,2.336
"We&amp;#39;re not seeing people fall off, we&amp;#39;re seeing",1421.186,1.835
people come on board.,1423.021,1.502
"That&amp;#39;s a great trajectory to have, and so I like",1424.523,3.737
where we&amp;#39;re headed.,1428.26,0.667
The Press: Two very quick clarifications on previous,1428.927,3.537
answers and then I have a third question.,1432.464,1.435
I think the issue was not what the President had,1433.899,3.67
done but what White House staffers were doing,1437.569,2.903
with their official Twitter accounts.,1440.472,1.835
So while the law does not apply to the President it,1442.307,2.636
was a question about White House staff.,1444.943,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: Okay, so you want me to answer that one?",1446.278,1.535
The Press: Sure.,1447.813,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Let me read for you from,1448.48,1.368
18 U.S. Code 1913.,1449.848,0.667
&amp;quot;The Department of Justice consistently has construed,1450.515,2.036
that the Anti-Lobbying Act as limiting the lobbying,1452.551,2.235
activities personally undertaken by the,1454.786,1.368
"President, his aides and assistants with the",1456.154,2.169
"Executive Office of the President, the Vice",1458.323,2.002
"President, Cabinet members within their areas of",1460.325,1.602
"responsibilities, and others confirmed officials",1461.927,2.202
appointed by the President responsibility.&amp;quot;,1464.129,1.702
So there&amp;#39;s clearly a carve-out for that.,1465.831,1.768
Next.,1467.599,0.667
The Press: When you were talking about the Byrd,1468.266,4.038
"Rule earlier, can we read from your answer that Vice",1472.304,3.036
President Pence does not at any point intend to,1475.34,2.302
overrule the Senate parliamentarian?,1477.642,1.335
Mr. Spicer: It&amp;#39;s not a question of overrule.,1478.977,2.236
You don&amp;#39;t overrule.,1481.213,0.867
The Senate parliamentarian makes interpretations.,1482.08,2.803
It&amp;#39;s up to the presiding officer.,1484.883,1.568
The Press: -- right?,1486.451,1.235
"Mr. Spicer: I do, but I also understand",1487.686,2.402
how the Senate works.,1490.088,1.235
And the presiding officer determines -- the Senate,1491.323,2.068
parliamentarian has asked for guidance.,1493.391,1.368
"The Press: Sure, and if the guidance from the",1494.759,2.069
Senate parliamentarian is that something would,1496.828,3.737
"violate the Byrd Rule, would Vice President Pence --",1500.565,2.369
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to answer,1502.934,1.568
"hypotheticals about what he may do, not on this",1504.502,2.169
bill or any other.,1506.671,0.935
"The Press: Just finally, CNN reported",1507.606,3.937
yesterday that U.S.,1511.543,1.068
officials believe that -- are investigating that,1512.611,2.535
associates of President Trump communicated with,1515.146,2.169
suspected Russian operatives to coordinate,1517.315,1.835
the release of information damaging to Hillary,1519.15,2.536
Clinton&amp;#39;s campaign.,1521.686,0.701
I&amp;#39;m wondering if you can respond to that or say,1522.387,3.637
definitely that they did not do so.,1526.024,2.536
Mr. Spicer: So let&amp;#39;s actually look,1528.56,1.802
at what CNN reported.,1530.362,1.468
They reported that anonymous U.S.,1531.83,1.635
officials have told them that information indicates,1533.465,2.702
that association of the campaign and suspected,1536.167,2.737
"operatives coordinated, which they admit is not",1538.904,2.068
"conclusive of anything, is bordering on collusion.",1540.972,2.836
"The last line of the thing said, &amp;quot;The FBI cannot yet",1543.808,2.57
prove that collusion took place.&amp;quot;,1546.378,1.835
I think there&amp;#39;s probably more evidence that CNN,1548.213,2.769
colluded with the Clinton campaign to give her,1550.982,1.735
debate questions than the Trump campaign gave any,1552.717,3.037
kind of collusion.,1555.754,1.234
"So I think when it comes down to that reporting, it",1556.988,2.269
is filled with a bunch of subjective terms about,1559.257,1.935
"this person may have done this, possibly",1561.192,1.669
could have done that.,1562.861,1.001
"And at the end of the story, if you wade to the",1563.862,1.968
"very bottom it says, &amp;quot;The FBI cannot yet prove that",1565.83,2.636
collusion took place.&amp;quot;,1568.466,0.935
So I&amp;#39;ve addressed this type of reporting in the,1569.401,2.702
"past, and this fits right in.",1572.103,1.869
John.,1573.972,0.667
The Press: Without getting too deep in the weeds on,1574.639,3.904
exactly what this strategy is in the Senate to get,1578.543,4.171
"this bill through the Byrd Rule, is the President",1582.714,2.369
confident that the strategy that&amp;#39;s being,1585.083,2.002
developed in the Senate will result in a bill,1587.085,2.97
that can pass muster?,1590.055,1.067
Mr. Spicer: Yes.,1591.122,1.135
The Press: And the President told us several,1592.257,2.969
weeks ago that if it looked like the Democrats,1595.226,3.337
"were going to filibuster Judge Gorsuch, he would",1598.563,2.569
encourage Mitch McConnell,1601.132,1.068
to invoke the nuclear option.,1602.2,1.401
Has the President&amp;#39;s position on,1603.601,1.736
that changed at all?,1605.337,1.201
Mr. Spicer: The President has not spoken to,1606.538,1.868
Senator McConnell yet.,1608.406,1.335
"I think Senator Schumer, as you know, within the",1609.741,1.802
last hour or so came out with his position.,1611.543,2.602
I&amp;#39;m sure that after we get through tonight the,1614.145,2.403
President will have some kind of conversation with,1616.548,1.535
Senator McConnell and discuss Senate strategy.,1618.083,1.568
We&amp;#39;re not there yet.,1619.651,0.934
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1620.585,1.001
Following up on Jordan&amp;#39;s question and then I have,1621.586,1.769
a follow-up on Hallie&amp;#39;s question.,1623.355,1.534
How did Chairman Nunes end up at the,1624.889,2.369
White House yesterday?,1627.258,1.035
"This morning he said he invited himself here, but",1628.293,3.103
that&amp;#39;s sort of an uncommon way to end up here.,1631.396,3.47
Can you take us through sort of the tick-tock,1634.866,3.137
of what happened?,1638.003,1.034
Mr. Spicer: No.,1639.037,1.168
I don&amp;#39;t know how he got here.,1640.205,1.067
I assume in a car.,1641.272,0.935
(Laughter.),1642.207,1.701
But I also don&amp;#39;t track him.,1643.908,1.569
I don&amp;#39;t keep his schedule either.,1645.477,2.135
The Press: You know who he spoke with at,1647.612,1.335
the White House?,1648.947,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: No, I don&amp;#39;t.",1649.614,0.667
He literally gave a press conference as we were,1650.281,1.335
starting and saying I&amp;#39;m going to go down to the,1651.616,2.336
White House after we brief the press.,1653.952,2.102
The Press: Was this the first time that the White,1656.054,1.368
House was made aware of the surveillance that he,1657.422,2.202
brought to the President yesterday?,1659.624,1.335
Mr. Spicer: I believe that the information that he,1660.959,1.368
shared with the President was new.,1662.327,1.334
The Press: And then the follow-up on healthcare.,1663.661,1.669
Is there any sort of plan if the bill does,1665.33,1.802
not pass tonight?,1667.132,0.834
Mr. Spicer: No.,1667.966,0.7
The Press: What is the plan B?,1668.666,1.569
"Mr. Spicer: No, it&amp;#39;s going to pass.",1670.235,1.601
So that&amp;#39;s it.,1671.836,0.668
Kaitlan.,1672.504,0.667
The Press: Now that you&amp;#39;ve been briefed -- I know,1673.171,1.368
yesterday you hadn&amp;#39;t been on everything had just,1674.539,1.768
happened -- can you say if the information that Nunes,1676.307,2.303
had is the same information that the,1678.61,2.536
President said he had that,1681.146,1.801
would be revealed this week?,1682.947,1.802
Mr. Spicer: We&amp;#39;re not going to -- my,1684.749,2.503
"understanding, because I was not briefed on the",1687.252,1.968
"contents of that, was that he spoke generally about",1689.22,3.237
what he had seen in these reports that he had been,1692.457,6.506
"made privy to, but that there was further details",1698.963,3.404
he wanted the President to know what he had seen and,1702.367,3.036
that it wasn&amp;#39;t related to Russia.,1705.403,1.335
"But he&amp;#39;s continuing, as, again -- all of his public",1706.738,2.803
comments are that he is going to continue to,1709.541,2.269
pursue this and that he&amp;#39;ll,1711.81,1.801
have further updates later.,1713.611,0.835
But I&amp;#39;m not aware of the specific nature of it.,1714.446,2.869
Cecilia.,1717.315,0.834
"The Press: Wait, one more question.",1718.149,1.335
What will the President&amp;#39;s reaction be to Republicans,1719.484,1.401
who vote against the healthcare bill tonight?,1720.885,2.036
And are they being encouraged the,1722.921,2.235
vote their conscience?,1725.156,1.101
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think I&amp;#39;ve addressed this",1726.257,2.203
"before, but I think the President has made very",1728.46,1.568
clear that Republicans in particular have made a,1730.028,3.27
commitment to constituents and to the American people,1733.298,2.435
that if given the opportunity to have a,1735.733,1.936
"Republican President, a Republican Senate and a",1737.669,2.068
"Republican House, that they would enact a",1739.737,3.971
repeal-and-replace and put into it a,1743.708,2.236
patient-centered healthcare.,1745.944,1.101
"He believes, as he mentioned during --when he",1747.045,2.969
"met with the House conference, as he",1750.014,1.335
mentioned with the members of the Freedom Caucus,1751.349,3.07
"today, and I think in several meetings, that",1754.419,1.835
this is something that we&amp;#39;ve talked about.,1756.254,1.335
You&amp;#39;ve taken a bunch of these free votes when it,1757.589,1.968
didn&amp;#39;t matter because you didn&amp;#39;t have a,1759.557,1.335
Republican President.,1760.892,1.235
And you got to vote for repeal and go back and,1762.127,2.035
tell your constituents something like 50 times --,1764.162,2.402
"well, this is a live ball now.",1766.564,2.403
"And this is for real, and we&amp;#39;re going to do what we",1768.967,1.635
pledged to the American people and keep our word.,1770.602,2.469
And he&amp;#39;s made it very clear that part of the,1773.071,2.736
reason that he got elected is because he went out and,1775.807,2.002
made a series of bold pledges to the American,1777.809,2.469
"people about what he would do if he were President,",1780.278,2.002
and he&amp;#39;s acting on those.,1782.28,1.034
And he&amp;#39;s acting swiftly and boldly with respect to,1783.314,2.269
this in particular -- and that he believes that not,1785.583,2.603
"just him, but that members of the House and the",1788.186,2.269
Senate have an obligation to fulfill the promise and,1790.455,1.968
the pledge that they made to the American people.,1792.423,1.869
Cecilia.,1794.292,0.667
"The Press: Regardless of what happens tonight, will",1794.959,2.136
we hear from the President?,1797.095,0.967
Will he come out and make a statement?,1798.062,1.535
Mr. Spicer: I think it&amp;#39;s going to depend on,1799.597,1.535
what time the vote is.,1801.132,2.603
"So I don&amp;#39;t want to commit -- I&amp;#39;m sure in some way,",1803.735,2.536
shape or form we&amp;#39;ll have some kind of comment.,1806.271,2.202
The Press: And similar to the question you were,1808.473,1.968
"asked here, but is the President, no matter what",1810.441,2.803
"happens, prepared to take responsibility for the",1813.244,3.304
outcome of this bill?,1816.548,1.868
Mr. Spicer: In what way?,1818.416,2.469
The Press: Whether it succeeds or fails?,1820.885,1.935
His name is on it.,1822.82,1.369
A lot of people think so.,1824.189,1.234
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think that in the sense that",1825.423,2.002
we&amp;#39;ve been very clear about this is a priority,1827.425,2.836
of ours and we&amp;#39;ve worked with him.,1830.261,1.335
"But again, I go back to -- at the end of the day, we",1831.596,3.036
can&amp;#39;t make people vote.,1834.632,2.069
"We&amp;#39;ve done everything we can to listen to them, to",1836.701,2.336
"incorporate their thoughts, to incorporate",1839.037,2.002
their ideas to make the bill as best we can.,1841.039,3.703
"But it&amp;#39;s a balancing act, make no mistake about it,",1844.742,2.57
that there&amp;#39;s a full spectrum of folks in the,1847.312,2.035
House that have disparate desires.,1849.347,3.67
But I think we can all commit that this is the,1853.017,3.003
one vehicle that&amp;#39;s going to repeal something that,1856.02,3.237
almost every single Republican that I&amp;#39;m aware,1859.257,1.802
of has pledged to do if they were reelected or elected.,1861.059,3.136
And I think that there&amp;#39;s a desire that -- we,1864.195,2.836
understand that not every member is going to,1867.031,3.204
find this perfect.,1870.235,1.234
"That&amp;#39;s what happens when you need to get, in",1871.469,3.604
"this case, 216 votes.",1875.073,1.635
But it&amp;#39;s the best bill that takes into,1876.708,2.602
consideration all of the concerns and all of the,1879.31,3.103
goals and all the values -- and I understand that,1882.413,1.936
"in a lot of cases, some of it isn&amp;#39;t a question of the",1884.349,2.969
"policy, it&amp;#39;s a question of the timing and some of the",1887.318,3.57
things that people want that are happening in,1890.888,1.736
phase three and phase one.,1892.624,1.601
"But as we&amp;#39;ve addressed, the Byrd Rule, which is --",1894.225,3.003
"to most people, this arcane thing probably even",1897.228,2.603
in the House that don&amp;#39;t have to deal with it -- in,1899.831,1.601
the Senate that deals with whether or not -- and if,1901.432,3.804
there is a -- if it is loaded up with things that,1905.236,3.07
"are stricken, then it doesn&amp;#39;t serve us any good.",1908.306,2.569
I think that we have put together a very,1910.875,1.568
comprehensive approach to addressing how to actually,1912.443,4.772
repeal and how to actually replace.,1917.215,1.868
I think the President walked through with the,1919.083,2.136
House Freedom Caucus today several of the,1921.219,2.102
administrative acts that Secretary Price would be,1923.321,2.602
taking in accordance with the authority that was,1925.923,2.57
granted to him by the Obamacare legislation and,1928.493,4.004
by some of the actions that Secretary Sebelius,1932.497,1.902
took back in 2009.,1934.399,2.402
There&amp;#39;s a lot of concern among members about some,1936.801,4.004
"of the sequencing on things, and I think that",1940.805,1.635
we have continued to not -- so this isn&amp;#39;t,1942.44,1.935
just about policy.,1944.375,0.868
Some of it&amp;#39;s about sequencing and timing.,1945.243,1.468
And I think the President and the Vice President and,1946.711,2.536
the rest of the team have done a lot to reassure,1949.247,1.701
them on the sequencing and how this thing,1950.948,2.269
is going to act.,1953.217,3.27
So that discussion I think has continued to be very,1956.487,5.84
productive to reassure members how this thing is,1962.327,2.669
going to happen and take place.,1964.996,2.202
Eamon.,1967.198,0.667
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1967.865,1.001
A moment ago you said that there was some members of,1968.866,2.47
the House Freedom Caucus in the meeting today who,1971.336,2.335
"were &amp;quot;no&amp;#39;s&amp;quot; who stood up and said, Mr. President,",1973.671,2.302
I&amp;#39;m with you.,1975.973,0.768
Can you tell us how many of those there were and,1976.741,2.836
what their names were?,1979.577,1.034
Mr. Spicer: Not yet.,1980.611,1.202
And I&amp;#39;m not trying to be cute about this.,1981.813,1.368
"I think as we do this -- as we do the whip count, I",1983.181,3.904
"think as you can imagine, that we&amp;#39;ve got to make",1987.085,2.168
sure that we don&amp;#39;t -- that this balancing act -- and,1989.253,2.703
you&amp;#39;ve got to now make sure that certain people,1991.956,1.468
don&amp;#39;t fall off the end,1993.424,1.001
as you pick up certain people.,1994.425,1.235
And so we&amp;#39;re keeping that vote total rather,1995.66,2.536
tight right now.,1998.196,0.667
But I feel very buoyed by the direction,1998.863,2.636
that we&amp;#39;re headed in.,2001.499,0.667
The Press: And can you give us a sense of what,2002.166,1.335
specific offer was made?,2003.501,1.068
There&amp;#39;s been reporting that the final offer was,2004.569,1.935
put on the table for these guys.,2006.504,1.568
What specific changes did the President offer them,2008.072,2.102
today that were new that we haven&amp;#39;t seen before?,2010.174,2.369
Mr. Spicer: It&amp;#39;s not just changes.,2012.543,1.502
"As I mentioned to Cecilia, part of this is some of",2014.045,3.303
the administrative stuff and making sure that they,2017.348,2.302
have reassurances that certain things that,2019.65,4.338
Secretary Sebelius enacted when she enrolled the bill,2023.988,3.337
"-- or, excuse me, enacted the bill that will be",2027.325,4.838
acted upon immediately.,2032.163,1.301
And so there was an enumeration of some of,2033.464,2.569
those things and a commitment on some of the,2036.033,2.303
other aspects of support that would be given for,2038.336,2.769
"the phase three bill about buying across state lines,",2041.105,2.77
increasing HHS -- HSAs.,2043.875,2.802
There was a lot of talk about that.,2046.677,1.469
And that&amp;#39;s where I think a lot of this comes down to,2048.146,1.868
"right now, especially among those members.",2050.014,2.369
They feel very good about the changes that have been,2052.383,4.271
made in the manager&amp;#39;s amendment and,2056.654,1.335
they feel very good.,2057.989,0.667
There is some question about the commitment and,2058.656,2.069
"changes that might take place in the Senate, and",2060.725,1.568
so that -- there was a lot of can we count on this,2062.293,2.703
when this happens.,2064.996,2.035
So I just want to -- some of this is working,2067.031,2.703
that way.,2069.734,0.667
Goyal.,2070.401,0.667
"The Press: Thank you very much, Sean.",2071.068,1.335
Two questions please.,2072.403,0.667
"One, as far as 68 countries representing",2073.07,3.137
against terrorism or against ISIS at the State,2076.207,4.338
Department under the leadership of Secretary of,2080.545,3.77
State Tillerson -- there was an advisor to the,2084.315,4.204
President of Afghanistan coming here,2088.519,2.436
speaking at CSIS.,2090.955,1.802
"And also, the day before yesterday, at the",2092.757,3.07
"(inaudible) he was addressing Mr. Rabbani,",2095.827,3.77
who is the foreign minister of Afghanistan.,2099.597,4.738
What both were saying or addressing to the audience,2104.335,4.071
at these two think tanks that unless we control two,2108.406,6.373
countries who are financing and training --,2114.779,4.271
"Saudi Arabia is financing in the name of charities,",2119.05,2.169
and Pakistan is training.,2124.956,2.102
So what is the presidential message to,2127.058,3.503
this group?,2130.561,0.668
"At the same time, there is a Mr. Abdel Said, who is",2131.229,1.668
"wanted by the U.S., $10 million -- there&amp;#39;s a",2132.897,1.335
bounty on him.,2134.232,0.7
And he&amp;#39;s openly spewing hatred against the U.S.,2134.932,4.738
and India and Pakistan.,2139.67,6.04
So where do we go from here?,2145.71,1.334
"Mr. Spicer: So, look, Secretary Tillerson is the",2147.044,2.069
meeting of -- have been going through this meeting,2149.113,3.003
with 68 of those members that are committed to,2152.116,3.737
addressing Syria and ISIS.,2155.853,1.702
I&amp;#39;m not going to get ahead of the internal,2157.555,1.868
discussions that Secretary Tillerson is having,2159.423,3.17
related to the administration&amp;#39;s review of,2162.593,1.502
Syria&amp;#39;s policy in particular.,2164.095,3.136
But I would stay in touch with the State,2167.231,1.335
Department on that.,2168.566,0.667
John.,2169.233,0.668
The Press: The second part of my question please.,2169.901,1.334
Mr. Spicer: Okay.,2171.235,0.701
The Press: As far as President&amp;#39;s relation with,2171.936,1.335
"the Indian American community is concerned,",2173.271,2.002
that 40 years it was 1976 when a spiritual leader,2175.273,4.838
came from -- all the way from India to New York,2180.111,2.402
"City, and he wanted to have a parade, Festival of",2182.513,5.639
"India in New York, but they didn&amp;#39;t have any",2188.152,3.103
"resources or sources, but Mr. Trump that time,",2191.255,3.137
"Donald Trump, came out and helped the group to",2194.392,3.036
go on this festival.,2197.428,2.936
"But now, candidate Trump was also among the Indian",2200.364,3.504
American community celebrating Diwali in New,2203.868,2.469
Jersey -- same group who has been now at the White,2206.337,3.77
"House this weekend, a peaceful prayer and vigil.",2210.107,3.737
They&amp;#39;re asking the President to come out or,2213.844,2.703
meet the Indian American community against hate,2216.547,2.936
crimes or somebody from the White House.,2219.483,1.735
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think we&amp;#39;ve discussed the nature",2221.218,2.436
of hate crimes in the past and we&amp;#39;ve condemned the,2223.654,2.436
act that happened in Kansas earlier this year.,2226.09,2.636
Obviously I&amp;#39;m sure that this is a very,2228.726,2.903
important issue for them.,2231.629,0.968
The President is right now focused in particular on,2232.597,3.269
"getting Obamacare repealed and replaced, the issue in",2235.866,5.005
London -- there&amp;#39;s a lot that&amp;#39;s occupying his time.,2240.871,2.403
And I&amp;#39;m sure that we will continue to monitor,2243.274,2.602
that situation as well.,2245.876,1.669
Mara.,2247.545,0.667
The Press: Will he come -- Mr. Spicer: Maybe someday.,2248.212,1.835
We&amp;#39;ll see.,2250.047,0.668
The Press: I have a question about essential,2250.715,1.735
health benefits.,2252.45,0.667
The President said to Tucker Carlson that he,2253.117,2.903
wasn&amp;#39;t going to -- if his people weren&amp;#39;t taken care,2256.02,5.005
"of, he wasn&amp;#39;t going to sign anything.",2266.23,5.005
And I&amp;#39;m wondering what he says to people who voted,2273.404,3.37
for him who relied on the provisions for opioid,2276.774,1.335
addiction -- things that were included in those,2278.109,1.334
"essential health benefits, if they go away.",2279.443,1.368
"Mr. Spicer: But -- yeah, I -- respectfully, I think",2280.811,1.335
that&amp;#39;s a false choice.,2282.146,0.667
"Again, the problem with Obamacare is it took all",2282.813,1.335
"of these benefits, mandated that they had to",2284.148,1.335
"be offered, and what happened is it spiked",2285.483,1.334
"insurance rates, it spiked deductibles, and",2286.817,1.368
choices went away.,2288.185,0.668
And the point isn&amp;#39;t making a benefit go away or not.,2288.853,1.334
"And that&amp;#39;s why I think it&amp;#39;s, respectfully,",2290.187,1.335
a false choice.,2291.522,0.667
It&amp;#39;s actually offering options to people.,2292.189,1.335
It&amp;#39;s literally like any other service or product,2293.524,1.335
that we have here in this country where you can,2294.859,1.368
buy what you want.,2296.227,1.101
Sometimes it&amp;#39;s at a lower price point because that&amp;#39;s,2297.328,2.202
what you can afford.,2299.53,0.701
Sometimes you buy features on a product because you,2300.231,4.204
want those features.,2304.435,1.068
Sometimes you determine that you don&amp;#39;t need -- but,2305.503,1.635
people should have choice in the healthcare market,2307.138,2.135
just the same way that they do in almost,2309.273,1.835
every other industry.,2311.108,0.935
"I mean, that&amp;#39;s the point.",2312.043,0.867
"It&amp;#39;s not about giving or taking, it&amp;#39;s about the",2312.91,2.669
point that they are being mandated in a way -- and,2315.579,2.436
"that&amp;#39;s the point, is that people should buy what",2318.015,2.069
"they want, and what is appropriate for themselves",2320.084,3.57
or their family.,2323.654,0.667
"I mean that -- The Press: Right now, where do the",2324.321,2.303
essential health benefits stand?,2326.624,1.334
"That they&amp;#39;re going to be part of this bill, or still --",2327.958,1.335
Mr. Spicer: I think my understanding is,2329.293,1.335
they&amp;#39;re part of the House bill.,2330.628,0.667
The Press: They&amp;#39;re going to be part of this bill?,2331.295,2.503
Mr. Spicer: Yeah.,2333.798,0.8
Alexis.,2334.598,0.668
"The Press: Sean, just to follow up on",2335.266,1.668
Mara&amp;#39;s question.,2336.934,0.667
"I think part of the inherent question is, a",2337.601,2.236
lot of people buy insurance not knowing what,2339.837,2.069
they&amp;#39;re going to need.,2341.906,1.067
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think if you&amp;#39;re an older man,",2342.973,2.036
you can generally say that you&amp;#39;re not going to,2345.009,1.935
need maternity care.,2346.944,0.667
The Press: That&amp;#39;s possible.,2347.611,2.503
But here is the question Mara was suggesting:,2350.114,1.568
Opioi0d and drug addiction -- you don&amp;#39;t buy your,2351.682,2.102
"insurance and say, I really need that back-up",2353.784,2.536
coverage because I think I&amp;#39;m going to get addicted,2356.32,2.336
to painkillers or opioid drugs.,2358.656,2.269
"So the question is, is the President confident that",2360.925,3.67
the kind of choice he has ambitions for would be,2364.595,2.97
offered by insurance companies on,2367.565,2.536
their own volition?,2370.101,1.301
"Mr. Spicer: I think several plans, I&amp;#39;m sure --",2371.402,1.234
"I mean, again, you&amp;#39;re asking -- I think there&amp;#39;s",2372.636,2.002
"a market for things, but like anything else, I",2374.638,2.503
"don&amp;#39;t think you buy insurance for anything,",2377.141,1.335
"Alexis, guessing saying, hey, I assume that if my",2378.476,3.603
"house burns down, I&amp;#39;m going to need to",2382.079,1.402
replace all these things.,2383.481,1.201
You buy insurance -- that&amp;#39;s the whole,2384.682,1.401
point of insurance.,2386.083,1.635
"And I think when people look at it, they&amp;#39;re going",2387.718,1.435
to buy what they may not need.,2389.153,1.768
"But they&amp;#39;re going to evaluate it, and that&amp;#39;s",2390.921,1.335
"the same thing when you look at a retirement plan,",2392.256,1.468
"or a car insurance, or any else.",2393.724,1.368
"You evaluate what your needs are, and then make",2395.092,2.936
the decision what&amp;#39;s best for you and your family.,2398.028,2.903
"The Press: Sean, can you say unequivocally that",2400.931,1.335
associates of President Trump did not collude with,2402.266,2.97
suspected Russian operatives and,2405.236,2.369
coordinate on the release --,2407.605,3.503
Mr. Spicer: So say the first part of it again.,2411.108,1.268
The Press: Can you say unequivocally that,2412.376,1.301
associates of Donald Trump --,2413.677,1.202
"Mr. Spicer: See, I think",2414.879,0.533
this is -- with all due -- and this is -- the,2415.412,1.869
way that the term &amp;quot;associates&amp;quot; is flown,2417.281,3.37
"around, I don&amp;#39;t understand what that means.",2420.651,1.935
"If you&amp;#39;re talking about employees of the campaign,",2422.586,2.102
employees of the transition or in the White,2424.688,1.802
"House, that&amp;#39;s one thing.",2426.49,1.335
But the way that this term &amp;quot;associates&amp;quot; gets thrown,2427.825,2.469
"out -- and again, we talked about this",2430.294,1.568
yesterday -- you pull out a gentleman who was,2431.862,2.569
employed by someone for five months and talk about,2434.431,2.737
a client that he had 10 years ago?,2437.168,1.868
"No, I can&amp;#39;t unequivocally say that nobody ever in",2439.036,2.836
"his past, who may or not have come in contact with",2441.872,2.937
"him, sat next to him in a plane, who grew up with",2444.809,2.769
"him in grade school -- because that&amp;#39;s, a lot of",2447.578,1.802
"times, this --",2449.38,1.001
"The Press: This gentleman, Paul",2450.381,1.201
"Manafort, you&amp;#39;re referring to was a campaign chairman --",2451.582,1.702
"Mr. Spicer: No, I get it.",2453.284,0.834
And you&amp;#39;re -- I understand who he is.,2454.118,2.369
Thank you.,2456.487,1.435
"I&amp;#39;m well aware of Paul, I read it out yesterday.",2457.922,1.902
"But the point that I&amp;#39;m making is, when you use a",2459.824,2.936
"term like &amp;quot;associate,&amp;quot; and you use all of these",2462.76,2.803
"subjective terms, there&amp;#39;s a reason that you&amp;#39;re doing",2465.563,2.068
"it, which is because you don&amp;#39;t have",2467.631,1.869
anything concrete.,2469.5,1.401
"If you do, come back to me and ask, &amp;quot;does anyone in",2470.901,2.236
"the White House,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;is anyone in the transition.&amp;quot;",2473.137,2.135
"But when you throw out a vague term like that,",2475.272,2.369
it&amp;#39;s a catch-all.,2477.641,0.968
Can you be certain that no one who works for Time,2478.609,2.236
Life Turner has ever done anything illegal?,2480.845,2.002
I think that&amp;#39;s a pretty broad way of casting a net,2482.847,2.202
-- or who has visited the building.,2485.049,1.968
"I mean, that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re equivocally saying.",2487.017,2.536
The Press: And also on the question of,2489.553,0.934
anonymous sources.,2490.487,0.835
"I mean, you clearly have an issue with the way that",2491.322,1.201
they have been used,2492.523,1.601
among the intelligence officials.,2494.124,1.469
But people in this White House are often on,2495.593,2.736
"background, they are often appearing as",2498.329,1.735
anonymous sources.,2500.064,0.867
Devin Nunes has used an anonymous source to,2500.931,2.236
present his intelligence.,2503.167,1.802
So why is it acceptable in that case but,2504.969,1.968
not in this case?,2506.937,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: First of all, there&amp;#39;s two issues here.",2507.605,1.401
"Number one is, what I have a problem with, and",2509.006,2.135
specific with the reporting that your,2511.141,1.902
"networks did yesterday, is it was one subjective",2513.043,2.336
term after another.,2515.379,1.768
It was associates that may or may not be there.,2517.147,2.303
"One subjective term after another, with no concrete",2519.45,4.137
proof that anything happened.,2523.587,1.669
"When you use a term like &amp;quot;associates,&amp;quot; you don&amp;#39;t",2525.256,2.168
even put a time frame around it.,2527.424,1.802
It&amp;#39;s a little bit nebulous at best to suggest that,2529.226,2.236
"somebody over and over again, making a claim the",2531.462,3.47
way you do and the narrative continues,2534.932,1.535
without any substantiation.,2536.467,2.269
"When you&amp;#39;re talking about Nunes, there&amp;#39;s a reason",2538.736,2.502
that someone who&amp;#39;s dealing with classified,2541.238,1.769
information can&amp;#39;t go out into public and reveal,2543.007,2.636
"certain things, because --",2545.643,1.635
The Press: He said the,2547.278,0.467
information wasn&amp;#39;t classified.,2547.745,0.7
"Mr. Spicer: No, that&amp;#39;s not what he said.",2548.445,1.836
I don&amp;#39;t think he ever said that anything,2550.281,0.967
wasn&amp;#39;t classified.,2551.248,1.635
But there are certain things that the methods --,2552.883,1.769
The Press: He said he was able to talk about it,2554.652,0.934
because it was not classified.,2555.586,1.001
"Mr. Spicer: No, no.",2556.587,0.834
He&amp;#39;s able to talk about the subject; he cannot,2557.421,1.335
"talk about the specifics, would be my suggestion --",2558.756,2.802
that you can&amp;#39;t talk about specifics of a case in,2561.558,2.236
terms of the sources and methods and,2563.794,1.535
the individuals.,2565.329,0.968
Because part of what&amp;#39;s happened is a lot of the,2566.297,1.601
individuals who have been masked or unmasked are,2567.898,2.002
supposed to be classified.,2569.9,2.302
So just because something has gone into the public,2572.202,1.302
domain doesn&amp;#39;t make it any less unclassified.,2573.504,2.402
That&amp;#39;s the problem.,2575.906,1.335
"The Press: Sean, the nuclear posture review is",2577.241,4.237
commencing with this administration.,2581.478,2.77
Can you assure us that everything is on the,2584.248,2.736
"table, including a lifting of a moratorium on nuclear",2586.984,4.838
"weapons testing, and also developing new",2591.822,2.636
nuclear warheads?,2594.458,1.101
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t have a full readout on,2595.559,1.402
that at this point.,2596.961,0.7
I&amp;#39;ll either get back to you or have someone from,2597.661,1.869
the NSC get back to you.,2599.53,1.468
Katie.,2600.998,1.001
"The Press: Sean, you keep saying that there&amp;#39;s not a",2601.999,1.268
plan B for healthcare.,2603.267,1.935
President Trump has repeatedly said that,2605.202,1.368
Republicans should just allow Obamacare to,2606.57,2.636
"collapse because Democrats will own that, and",2609.206,2.236
therefore maybe we shouldn&amp;#39;t do anything,2611.442,2.002
"about it, but it&amp;#39;s not fair to the American",2613.444,1.401
people to do that.,2614.845,1.168
Is the reason there&amp;#39;s not a plan B is because the,2616.013,2.269
President&amp;#39;s plan is to allow Obamacare,2618.282,2.669
to collapse?,2620.951,0.801
Mr. Spicer: No.,2621.752,0.534
"The President&amp;#39;s plan is to pass the bill tonight, get",2622.286,2.602
"it on to the Senate, and then sign a bill once it",2624.888,2.236
goes through conference.,2627.124,1.201
"That&amp;#39;s the President&amp;#39;s plan, and that&amp;#39;s why the",2628.325,1.802
President has been fighting for it.,2630.127,2.336
That&amp;#39;s why the President has been trying to make it,2632.463,2.269
stronger and stronger every day.,2634.732,1.668
"But I think he states a very clear reality, which",2636.4,2.502
"is, if it doesn&amp;#39;t do this, then it is a false choice",2638.902,2.67
to compare what we&amp;#39;re doing with Obamacare,2641.572,1.768
because Obamacare is collapsing -- the premiums,2643.34,2.636
"are skyrocketing, the choices are going down,",2645.976,2.269
the deductibles are going up.,2648.245,0.968
There is no equivalency.,2649.213,1.935
"Something is failing, and we&amp;#39;re actually trying to",2651.148,2.736
get rid of it to help the American people.,2653.884,1.802
"And the point the President is making is,",2655.686,1.268
"the politically expedient answer is to do nothing,",2656.954,3.336
but I think for the sake of the American people and,2660.29,1.702
"the needs that they have in terms of healthcare, I",2661.992,3.37
think we owe it to them to do the right thing.,2665.362,1.635
The Press: So a follow-up question: Who is the,2666.997,2.569
President holding accountable for a split in,2669.566,3.204
the Republican Party not being able to get this,2672.77,2.135
"bill done, the struggle that it&amp;#39;s taking to get",2674.905,2.302
the bill to the last minute?,2677.207,1.368
"Is he holding Republican leadership, Paul Ryan,",2678.575,2.336
accountable for bringing a bill to the table without,2680.911,3.504
having consensus from the Freedom Caucus?,2684.415,1.935
Or is he holding the Freedom Caucus accountable,2686.35,1.368
for opposing it?,2687.718,1.668
Mr. Spicer: I think right now we&amp;#39;re not focused on,2689.386,1.168
"blaming, we&amp;#39;re focused on getting it",2690.554,1.902
done and winning.,2692.456,1.535
"The Press: Sean, you&amp;#39;ve criticized President Obama",2693.991,2.869
"for the way he sold Obamacare, and there may",2696.86,2.203
be some validity to that.,2699.063,1.401
Mr. Spicer: Thank you.,2700.464,1.101
"The Press: But candidate Trump, President-elect",2701.565,1.835
"Trump, and now President Trump have been selling",2703.4,4.104
"this legislation as coverage for everybody,",2707.504,5.606
"lower premiums, lower deductibles,",2713.11,2.97
and better healthcare.,2716.08,1.668
Hasn&amp;#39;t he put Republicans on the spot with this,2717.748,3.236
legislation by selling it that way?,2720.984,3.137
Mr. Spicer: But it is.,2724.121,0.734
"So, yes, thank you for the advertisement, I",2724.855,2.669
appreciate it.,2727.524,1.201
I think --,2728.725,2.203
The Press: Can it do that?,2730.928,1.201
"Mr. Spicer: Of course, it can.",2732.129,0.667
I will do that.,2732.796,1.302
And that&amp;#39;s what the point is.,2734.098,3.136
"But I think that there has been -- A, I think there",2737.234,1.635
"is some concern, as I mentioned earlier,",2738.869,1.668
about the timing.,2740.537,1.769
And I think we have continued to allay a lot,2742.306,1.635
of those concerns because of the rule that they are.,2743.941,4.104
"And again, one of the things that is tough to",2748.045,2.002
"explain to a lot -- or not tough to explain, but just",2750.047,2.169
"the reality, is that if we don&amp;#39;t do it the way that",2752.216,2.102
"we&amp;#39;re going to do it, we need 60 votes.",2754.318,2.235
And we&amp;#39;re not going to get 60 votes in the,2756.553,1.402
Senate for this bill.,2757.955,1.401
The Democrats are united in stopping any progress,2759.356,2.669
being made on this.,2762.025,1.669
And so I think the point that we&amp;#39;ve had to make,2763.694,2.335
"over and over again is, I get it.",2766.029,1.936
"In a perfect world, if we had 60 votes, we could do",2767.965,2.068
"this in a very, very different way and have a",2770.033,1.902
"much more comprehensive legislative strategy, but",2771.935,2.603
in the same way that the Democrats use,2774.538,1.835
"reconciliation, as do we, to undo it.",2776.373,2.536
"And the reason that it is a three-pronged,",2778.909,2.102
three-phase approach is because of the nature that,2781.011,3.003
it has to get dealt with.,2784.014,1.168
"And I think for a lot of folks, many of them are",2785.182,3.837
"new to the process, many of them want to see it",2789.019,3.804
done in a different way.,2792.823,1.034
And I think we are trying to do it in the most,2793.857,1.869
"responsible way, so that when it gets sent over the",2795.726,2.369
"Senate, we don&amp;#39;t have to have a huge parliamentary",2798.095,2.369
fight about what&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Byrd-able&amp;quot; or not.,2800.464,3.637
And that&amp;#39;s -- while most people don&amp;#39;t want to fully,2804.101,3.17
"appreciate the nuances of that, it&amp;#39;s a reality that",2807.271,4.137
we have to face if we actually want,2811.408,1.535
to get it done.,2812.943,1.034
"And I think that makes a big, big difference.",2813.977,2.336
Peter.,2816.313,0.801
"The Press: Sean, yesterday when Chairman Nunes was",2817.114,1.935
"here, we heard his comments.",2819.049,1.168
"Today, behind closed doors, he apologized to",2820.217,2.402
the committee for not coming to them before,2822.619,1.835
he came to the press.,2824.454,0.935
And then he expressed regret for the way he,2825.389,1.635
handled this -- going public and going to the,2827.024,1.701
President before speaking to the members of,2828.725,2.837
his own committee.,2831.562,0.7
"So I guess my question is, why was it appropriate?",2832.262,2.803
Why does the White House believe it was appropriate,2835.065,1.635
for Chairman Nunes to come and give this information,2836.7,2.669
to the President regarding an investigation about the,2839.369,2.736
President&amp;#39;s own associates during the campaign?,2842.105,2.536
"Mr. Spicer: Well, two things.",2844.641,0.634
"One is, it wasn&amp;#39;t -- as has been asked before, to",2845.275,3.237
ask me why he did something -- he made a,2848.512,1.835
"decision, he briefed -- hold on,",2850.347,1.468
you&amp;#39;re getting there.,2851.815,2.069
"I&amp;#39;ve seen enough of you, Peter.",2853.884,3.136
I know where you were going.,2857.02,0.801
(Laughter.),2857.821,1.735
"But the reality is, is",2859.556,3.07
that he made a decision.,2862.626,2.769
He briefed the press first.,2865.395,1.335
"No one had a problem, by the way, in the press",2866.73,2.236
corps getting briefed before anybody else.,2868.966,2.669
He went down and he briefed your colleagues,2871.635,1.501
before he briefed anybody else.,2873.136,1.669
I don&amp;#39;t hear too much crying about that.,2874.805,2.235
The reality is -- and then he made a statement and,2877.04,1.769
"said, I&amp;#39;m going to come down to the White House",2878.809,1.334
"and share this information with the President,",2880.143,2.069
as has just been noted.,2882.212,1.502
He didn&amp;#39;t give us a heads-up.,2883.714,1.601
"He told us he made an announcement, he said I&amp;#39;m",2885.315,1.602
"coming down to the White House, asked for time to",2886.917,1.835
share this with the President.,2888.752,1.168
"And I think part of the reason, to be clear and to",2889.92,1.802
"your question, is specifically to say that",2891.722,3.103
there&amp;#39;s a big difference between any discussion,2894.825,2.402
about what&amp;#39;s going on in Russia and why this,2897.227,1.635
intelligence was picked up.,2898.862,1.769
His comments yesterday were very clear the,2900.631,1.568
intelligence and the information that he picked,2902.199,3.003
up had nothing to do with Russia.,2905.202,2.069
"And I think he felt as though, according to his",2907.271,2.635
"own words, that he had an obligation to make sure",2909.906,1.635
the President knew what he had discovered.,2911.541,3.17
"That&amp;#39;s it, plain and simple.",2914.711,1.368
"The Press: So to be clear, though, just because",2916.079,1.302
"appearances matter on this, doesn&amp;#39;t the White",2917.381,1.635
House have a concern that it creates the appearance,2919.016,2.402
that there was potentially interference by the,2921.418,2.302
President that he was included in conversations,2923.72,2.369
about the investigation because it was completed?,2926.089,2.169
"Mr. Spicer: My concern, to be perfectly blunt with",2928.258,3.07
"you, is that it&amp;#39;s always -- you seem to have an",2931.328,3.036
obsession with the process and not the substance.,2934.364,2.77
"At some point, isn&amp;#39;t --",2937.134,1.334
The Press: Isn&amp;#39;t the President --,2938.468,0.601
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, hold on, hold on.",2939.069,0.701
The Press: The President is the one who wants,2939.77,0.8
the conclusion.,2940.57,0.534
He asked for it.,2941.104,0.534
Mr. Spicer: I understand that.,2941.638,1.201
"The Press: So I&amp;#39;m asking, why didn&amp;#39;t he ask for",2942.839,0.167
details before it was completed?,2943.006,1.635
Mr. Spicer: Because as Chairman Nunes said -- and,2944.641,1.468
"again, I&amp;#39;m just going to make it clear -- because",2946.109,2.236
he said that he wanted to make it very clear that,2948.345,3.136
the discussion and the revelations that he had,2951.481,2.403
were not -- did not regard anything to do with,2953.884,4.137
"Russia, and he wanted the",2958.021,0.934
President to understand that.,2958.955,1.369
But there seems to be this obsession with the,2960.324,2.435
"process: how did he get here, when did he go,",2962.759,4.238
what was the reaction.,2966.997,1.535
"At some point, there should be a concern",2968.532,1.201
about the substance.,2969.733,1.668
That&amp;#39;s a very serious revelation that he&amp;#39;s made,2971.401,3.203
about what happened during the 2016 election with,2974.604,2.403
respect to our side and some of the things,2977.007,2.369
that happened.,2979.376,0.6
"And at some point, I would implore, urge, beg some of",2979.976,3.871
you to use some of your investigative skills to,2983.847,2.669
"look into what actually did happen, why did it",2986.516,3.103
"happen, what was going on back there,",2989.619,1.936
who knew what when.,2991.555,1.668
But I think that there should be a similar,2993.223,1.502
"concern, as opposed to figuring out whether he",2994.725,1.701
took a skateboard or a car here to exactly what,2996.426,2.536
happened and why it happened.,2998.962,1.835
"And the reality is, is that whether he briefed us",3000.797,1.835
first or he briefed the Democratic members -- and,3002.632,3.637
that&amp;#39;s up to him to decide -- the substance of what,3006.269,2.47
he shared should be troubling to everybody.,3008.739,3.036
And that&amp;#39;s what I think is the important thing.,3011.775,2.069
"The Press: To follow on this thought, I want to",3013.844,1.134
"ask you -- at CPAC, President Trump said,",3014.978,1.769
people &amp;quot;shouldn&amp;#39;t be allowed to use sources,3016.747,1.801
unless they use someone&amp;#39;s name.&amp;quot;,3018.548,1.735
"He said, it does &amp;quot;tremendous disservice.&amp;quot;",3020.283,1.869
This is following up on the conversation you,3022.152,1.001
started with Sarah earlier.,3023.153,1.735
"So, I guess, the simple question is -- Chairman",3024.888,1.735
Nunes came out; he noted sources that he,3026.623,4.104
couldn&amp;#39;t create and provide publicly.,3030.727,2.87
"So why, when it&amp;#39;s politically advantageous,",3033.597,2.235
"is that use of sourcing okay, but when it&amp;#39;s",3035.832,1.902
"politically damaging, it&amp;#39;s not okay?",3037.734,2.036
"Mr. Spicer: No, I think there&amp;#39;s a difference -- he",3039.77,1.301
came out and briefed people on what he knew at,3041.071,1.868
"the time, and said he was literally going to get",3042.939,2.536
further briefs and would have further updates.,3045.475,1.435
That&amp;#39;s a big difference than reporting and making,3046.91,2.803
a serious allegation.,3049.713,1.435
"In fact, he was doing quite the opposite.",3051.148,2.002
He was vindicating the President and saying there,3053.15,2.269
is something that you need to know about the,3055.419,1.835
substance of the allegations that are being,3057.254,1.601
made against you.,3058.855,1.168
"And while that may or may not be the case, because",3060.023,2.836
some of what I&amp;#39;ve seen -- The Press: But if he had,3062.859,1.802
"not been vindicating him, wouldn&amp;#39;t it have been just",3064.661,1.468
as important for the President to learn?,3066.129,1.769
Mr. Spicer: Sure.,3067.898,0.901
"And I think maybe he would have, and then you",3068.799,1.501
"probably wouldn&amp;#39;t have any concern with that,",3070.3,1.335
would you?,3071.635,0.834
The Press: My question is to you.,3072.469,0.934
Mr. Spicer: Margaret.,3073.403,1.502
"The Press: Following on that, two questions.",3074.905,1.234
"You said again, the word &amp;quot;vindicated.&amp;quot;",3076.139,2.202
The President said he felt somewhat vindicated.,3078.341,1.502
Did he feel that having Chairman Nunes come down,3079.843,3.57
here helped his own credibility?,3083.413,3.57
Mr. Spicer: I think it&amp;#39;s reassuring to know that,3086.983,2.136
"what he discussed -- while, again, the Chairman",3089.119,3.737
made it very clear that he&amp;#39;s not final in any of,3092.856,5.906
"his processes, that what he had seen so far gave",3098.762,3.203
him grave concern -- or whatever the exact phrase,3101.965,2.402
before I get -- but to use the phrase that Chairman,3104.367,4.138
Nunes needed to say -- that he said.,3108.505,3.637
That it gave him concern and pause for what he had,3112.142,1.935
"seen, and wanted the President to be aware of",3114.077,1.468
the activity that he had seen that occurred during,3115.545,2.102
the transition period.,3117.647,2.803
"I think that&amp;#39;s an important -- so I think,",3120.45,2.77
"yes, the President did -- it was helpful for the",3123.22,2.702
"President to know that the investigation, as he had",3125.922,2.97
"asked for, was starting to bear fruit.",3128.892,2.002
"And again, I think the equally important thing to",3130.894,2.436
note about yesterday was that part of what Chairman,3133.33,3.236
Nunes said was that it had nothing to do with these,3136.566,2.336
allegations and narrative about Russia.,3138.902,3.87
"And I think that is a very, very important",3142.772,1.202
narrative to be clear on.,3143.974,3.303
The Press: And are they going to meet again?,3147.277,1.068
"And after conversations, since they spoke directly,",3148.345,2.936
did the President accept Chairman Nunes&amp;#39;s finding,3151.281,3.47
that there was no wiretapping at Trump,3154.751,2.636
"Tower, which he said yesterday?",3157.387,2.302
"Mr. Spicer: Well, one, I don&amp;#39;t think that -- the",3159.689,2.002
first one wasn&amp;#39;t planned.,3161.691,0.634
There&amp;#39;s nothing planned for the Chairman to,3162.325,2.369
come down again.,3164.694,1.001
"But second of all, I think I have and the President",3165.695,3.137
has very clearly explained that the tweet wasn&amp;#39;t to,3168.832,2.869
be taken literally in the sense of the word,3171.701,2.236
&amp;quot;wiretap&amp;quot; -- that he was talking about,3173.937,1.568
surveillance in general.,3175.505,1.168
"And yes, I think that when -- yes, once what Chairman",3176.673,4.238
Nunes said is that there was evidence of,3180.911,2.235
surveillance that occurred during the election.,3183.146,3.337
And I think that is important to note.,3186.483,1.968
"Again, I think the obsession is with the",3188.451,1.535
"process of how he got here, and what time he",3189.986,2.069
"left, and who he briefed first, as opposed to the",3192.055,2.302
substance of this issue.,3194.357,1.735
But I&amp;#39;m not going to -- all I&amp;#39;ll tell you is the,3196.092,2.736
public comments that he made to you and your,3198.828,1.936
colleagues both here and up on Capitol Hill was,3200.764,2.335
that he was very concerned with the surveillance that,3203.099,2.436
he had seen and reports of surveillance and,3205.535,2.87
individuals who had been masked and unmasked during,3208.405,2.802
especially the transition period.,3211.207,2.77
I think that should express concern for a,3213.977,2.202
lot of individuals.,3216.179,1.101
The Press: Sot the President is confident,3217.28,0.868
that Chairman Nunes can continue to lead this,3218.148,2.169
"investigation, and, in his view, be impartial?",3220.317,2.402
Mr. Spicer: Absolutely.,3222.719,0.667
The Press: Because there have been some questions,3223.386,1.635
"about that, including from Republicans.",3225.021,0.534
Mr. Spicer: Yes.,3225.555,1.769
Thank you guys very much.,3227.324,0.7
Have a great one.,3228.024,1.201
