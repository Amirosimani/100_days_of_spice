"Mr. Spicer: Good afternoon, everyone.",5.605,1.535
"There&amp;#39;s a lot going on today, so I&amp;#39;m going to",7.14,2.069
keep this on the briefer side.,9.209,2.702
"This morning, the President announced the",11.911,1.335
official approval of the presidential permit for,13.246,1.869
the Keystone XL pipeline.,15.115,2.769
The last administration spent eight years delaying,17.884,2.169
this enormous investment in American,20.053,1.702
energy independence.,21.755,1.534
President Trump is moving this project forward in,23.289,2.269
just eight weeks.,25.558,1.735
"And just as he promised, it&amp;#39;s an even better deal",27.293,2.403
for the American people than before he,29.696,2.102
took office.,31.798,1.234
This project will directly generate an estimated,33.032,4.038
"16,100 jobs, according to the State Department --",37.07,4.037
all without spending a dime of taxpayer money.,41.107,2.336
"In many ways, this project represented everything",43.443,2.102
that was wrong with the infrastructure permitting,45.545,1.969
of the United States.,47.514,1.601
TransCanada spent an incredible amount of,49.115,1.869
resources attempting to comply with government,50.984,2.235
"regulations, only to be denied and delayed for",53.219,3.237
political reasons.,56.456,1.802
But the days of pointless government bureaucracy,58.258,2.602
holding up progress and production have ended.,60.86,2.703
"By simply getting excessive, duplicative",63.563,2.202
"regulations out of the way, we can make",65.765,2.169
infrastructure projects more attractive -- a more,67.934,3.237
"attractive prospect for private investors, and",71.171,2.502
encourage even more projects like this one.,73.673,2.703
Immediately following the announcement by,76.376,2.069
"TransCanada, the President announced that Charter",78.445,2.635
Communications has committed to investing $25,81.08,3.471
billion here in the United States and hiring an,84.551,3.336
"additional 20,000 American workers over the",87.887,2.97
next four years.,90.857,1.501
Charter Communications is truly an example of how,92.358,2.336
American leadership can turn a downturn entity,94.694,2.936
into an amazing success.,97.63,3.17
"Five years ago, Charter Communications was a",100.8,2.002
struggling company that had slowly emerged,102.802,2.403
from bankruptcy.,105.205,1.268
"Today, thanks to hard work and great leadership of",106.473,2.569
"Chairman and CEO Tom Rutledge, it is the",109.042,2.969
"fastest-growing television, Internet,",112.011,1.735
and voice company in the nation.,113.746,1.836
"And, most importantly, as Charter grew, American",115.582,2.302
"jobs grew, as they brought back many jobs that had",117.884,2.836
previously been shipped overseas.,120.72,2.236
"Today, Charter is also committed to completely",122.956,2.068
"ending its offshore call centers, basing 100",125.024,2.636
percent of them in the United States.,127.66,2.269
"Together, the TransCanada and Charter Communications",129.929,2.87
announcement demonstrate the new economic model of,132.799,2.869
what the President called The American Model.,135.668,2.903
By slashing job-killing regulations and reducing,138.571,2.269
"government burdens and lowering taxes, we will",140.84,2.503
make it easier for all businesses to grow right,143.343,2.102
"here at home, generating jobs and boosting our",145.445,2.502
economy by getting government out of the way.,147.947,3.103
"Following these big announcements, the",151.05,1.335
President had lunch with Secretary of the,152.385,1.802
Treasury Steve Mnuchin.,154.187,1.268
He was joined by Speaker Paul Ryan -- I&amp;#39;ll get to,155.455,3.003
in a second on that.,158.458,1.435
"Later in the afternoon, the President will host a",159.893,1.801
Greek Independence Day celebration.,161.694,2.102
"And as I mentioned yesterday, at 4 o&amp;#39;clock he",163.796,2.47
will meet with about two dozen Medal of Honor,166.266,1.601
"recipients to honor Medal of Honor Day, which is",167.867,4.571
technically tomorrow.,172.438,1.435
He&amp;#39;s honored to be hosting these great men and women,173.873,2.503
"of our Armed Services, the greatest force for peace",176.376,2.502
and justice the world has ever known.,178.878,2.236
"And obviously, later today, the House will be",181.114,2.702
voting on the American Health Care Act.,183.816,1.702
The current vote is scheduled for 3:30 p.m.,185.518,3.103
The President has been working the phones and,188.621,1.669
having in-person meetings since the American Health,190.29,2.535
Care Act was introduced.,192.825,1.569
He&amp;#39;s left everything on the field when it comes,194.394,1.635
to this bill.,196.029,1.034
The President and congressional Republicans,197.063,1.802
promised the American people that they would,198.865,1.568
repeal and replace this broken system.,200.433,2.402
"Obamacare&amp;#39;s Washington-driven,",202.835,1.635
one-size-fits-all plan had seven years to prove its,204.47,3.337
"case, and look what it&amp;#39;s left us with: Skyrocketing",207.807,2.97
"premiums -- on average, premiums for Obamacare",210.777,3.036
benchmark plans increased 25 percent in 2017.,213.813,4.338
Unaffordable deductibles -- the two most popular,218.151,3.136
Obamacare health plans have average deductibles,221.287,2.67
equivalent to 10 percent and 6 percent of the,223.957,2.535
median American household income.,226.492,2.303
"With these high deductibles, many people",228.795,1.535
"have, technically, insurance, but nothing",230.33,2.402
that they can afford to use.,232.732,1.902
Fewer choices -- one in five Americans have only,234.634,2.369
one insurer offering,237.003,1.234
Obamacare through exchanges.,238.237,2.937
"And, of course, higher taxes.",241.174,2.469
Key conservative groups like the Tea Party Express,243.643,2.302
and the American Conservative Union have,245.945,1.969
added themselves to a long list of organizations,247.914,2.235
expressing their support for the American Health,250.149,1.735
"Care Act because they know it&amp;#39;s our chance, after the",251.884,2.47
"American people have spent years suffering, to",254.354,1.534
finally repeal and replace the nightmare,255.888,2.136
of Obamacare.,258.024,1.234
The President looks forward to seeing the,259.258,1.535
House Republicans join with these influential,260.793,1.936
voices and vote in favor of the,262.729,2.002
American Health Care Act.,264.731,2.602
"The President, as I mentioned, had Speaker",267.333,2.169
Ryan come up here and visit with him to update,269.502,1.902
him on the bill.,271.404,2.069
They are continuing to,273.473,0.867
discuss the way forward on this.,274.34,2.236
The Speaker is updating him on his efforts.,276.576,2.135
"As I mentioned to you, the President has been working",278.711,2.503
"throughout the week on this, calling early --",281.214,2.869
starting early in the morning and working till,284.083,1.535
"late at night, calling with members,",285.618,1.802
visiting members.,287.42,0.701
"By our count, over 120 members have personally",288.121,3.27
"had a visit, call, or meeting here at the White",291.391,3.503
House in the past few days.,294.894,2.369
This is an extraordinary feat.,297.263,2.336
The President and his team have committed everything,299.599,1.868
they can to making this thing happen.,301.467,2.536
And the Speaker is going to continue to update him,304.003,2.069
on the way forward.,306.072,3.604
"Finally, a few administrative",309.676,1.101
notes here at the end.,310.777,0.967
"Yesterday, senior-level United States and Israeli",311.744,2.236
delegations concluded four days of intensive talks,313.98,4.004
"with a particular focus on concrete, near-term",317.984,2.169
measures to improve the overall climate in order,320.153,2.536
to advance the prospects of a genuine and lasting,322.689,3.103
peace between Israel and Palestine.,325.792,2.869
The United States delegation was led by,328.661,1.568
"Jason Greenblatt, Special Representative for",330.229,1.936
"International Negotiation, and included",332.165,2.269
representatives of the NSC and the,334.434,1.701
Department of State.,336.135,1.402
A principal focus of the discussion was specific,337.537,2.102
measures that could have a meaningful impact on the,339.639,2.502
"economic environment in the West Bank and Gaza,",342.141,2.803
allowing the Palestinians to more fully realize,344.944,2.202
their economic potential.,347.146,1.735
The two delegations also discussed Israeli,348.881,2.87
settlement construction.,351.751,1.702
The fact that both governments dedicated such,353.453,1.801
senior delegations for so many days reflects the,355.254,3.604
close cooperation between these countries and the,358.858,2.169
importance that both assign to this vital task.,361.027,3.67
"Last night, the President announced his intention to",364.697,2.036
nominate several key additional people to the,366.733,2.635
"administration, including Althea Coat-zee to be",369.368,2.536
Deputy Administrator of the Small Business,371.904,3.871
Administration; William Francis Hagerty IV to be,375.775,2.936
ambassador to Japan; Robert Sumwalt III to be a,378.711,3.67
member of the National Transportation Safety Board.,382.381,3.07
"And also this morning, of note, the United States",385.451,3.837
District Court for the Eastern District of,389.288,1.535
Virginia upheld the President&amp;#39;s revised,390.823,2.069
executive order protecting the nation from foreign,392.892,2.436
people who seek to do us harm into,397.396,1.402
the United States.,398.798,1.301
"We&amp;#39;re pleased with this ruling, which found the",400.099,1.835
plaintiffs have no likelihood of success on,401.934,2.069
the merits of their claims.,404.003,1.602
"As the court correctly notes in its opinion, the",405.605,1.902
President&amp;#39;s order falls well within his legal,407.507,1.968
authority to protect the nation&amp;#39;s security.,409.475,2.269
We&amp;#39;re confident the President&amp;#39;s fully lawful,411.744,3.003
and necessary action will ultimately be allowed to,414.747,2.803
move forward through the rest of the system,417.55,1.768
-- court system.,419.318,1.035
"In terms of the schedule for this weekend, the",420.353,1.334
President will spend a working weekend here in,421.687,1.769
"Washington, and we&amp;#39;ll update you with further",423.456,2.402
details regarding his schedule.,425.858,1.302
"With that, I&amp;#39;ll get to your questions.",427.16,1.968
Steve.,429.128,0.668
"The Press Sean, is it your understanding that you",429.796,2.235
don&amp;#39;t have the votes to pass the,432.031,2.369
healthcare legislation?,434.4,1.068
Is that the message that Speaker Ryan delivered today?,435.468,2.936
"And if so, what lessons do you draw",438.404,1.802
from this process?,440.206,0.767
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think the Speaker is currently",440.973,2.403
having a conversation with him to talk about where,443.376,1.835
that vote count stands.,445.211,2.002
He&amp;#39;s working with the members of -- you know,447.213,1.802
the President made a sell.,449.015,1.134
They had the Tuesday Group here.,450.149,1.535
There were 17 members here; 16 walked,451.684,1.869
out as a &amp;quot;yes.&amp;quot;,453.553,0.7
I think we&amp;#39;ve had a group of members that we&amp;#39;ve,454.253,4.238
continued to have a conversation with and try,458.491,2.669
"to make -- frankly, at this point, it&amp;#39;s not a",461.16,2.803
question of negotiating anymore.,463.963,1.335
It&amp;#39;s understanding the greater good,465.298,1.668
that&amp;#39;s at hand.,466.966,1.602
The President understands this is it.,468.568,1.735
We had this opportunity to change the trajectory of,470.303,5.338
healthcare to help improve -- put a healthcare system,475.641,2.336
in place and to end the nightmare that Republicans,477.977,3.537
have campaigned on called Obamacare.,481.514,2.135
I noted yesterday it was the seventh-year,483.649,1.835
anniversary of Obamacare.,485.484,1.635
We have an opportunity to make sure that was the,487.119,1.402
"last one, and the question is, do members realize",488.521,2.636
this opportunity.,491.157,2.135
There&amp;#39;s no question in my mind at least that the,493.292,2.703
President and the team here have left,495.995,1.668
everything on the field.,497.663,0.801
He has called every member that had a question or,498.464,1.835
"concern, tried to, to the extent possible, take into",500.299,3.804
consideration ideas that would strengthen the bill.,504.103,2.936
And it&amp;#39;s now going to be up to the members of the,507.039,2.236
House to decide whether or not they want to follow,509.275,2.302
through on the promise to that.,511.577,1.402
But we&amp;#39;re going to continue to work with the,512.979,2.168
Speaker and the leadership there to see,515.147,3.838
where the votes are.,518.985,1.101
"We&amp;#39;re getting closer and closer, but you",520.086,2.302
need to get to 216.,522.388,0.934
And they&amp;#39;re starting four hours of debate.,523.322,3.237
I expect a vote somewhere,526.559,2.369
around 3:30-4 o&amp;#39;clock hour.,528.928,2.336
We&amp;#39;ll see where we go.,531.264,0.667
Hunter.,531.931,0.667
"The Press Thank you, Sean.",532.598,1.769
We&amp;#39;re hearing that Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell,534.367,3.236
wanted to do a clean repeal and then,537.603,2.97
replace over time.,540.573,1.568
"In retrospect, would that have been",542.141,1.335
a better approach?,543.476,0.867
"And in general, do you think Paul Ryan has",544.343,2.036
handled this well?,546.379,0.8
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know that that&amp;#39;s,547.179,2.002
entirely the case.,549.181,0.735
I know that this was a joint effort.,549.916,3.003
This is something that the House determined in terms,552.919,3.236
of the three-pronged approach that we had.,556.155,2.336
So I don&amp;#39;t know that I necessarily agree with the,560.66,2.135
assessment of how that happened.,562.795,1.368
"The Press And, in general, is the White House happy",564.163,1.735
with how Paul Ryan has handled this?,565.898,1.668
Mr. Spicer: I think the Speaker has done,567.566,1.802
everything he can.,569.368,0.668
He&amp;#39;s worked really closely with the President.,570.036,2.969
I think at the end of the day -- I said this,573.005,1.769
yesterday -- you can&amp;#39;t force people to vote.,574.774,3.47
But I think we&amp;#39;ve given them every single reason,578.244,2.369
"to fulfill every pledge that they&amp;#39;ve made, and I",580.613,3.804
think this is the right thing to do.,584.417,1.768
Maggie.,586.185,1.034
I don&amp;#39;t want you to live-Tweet this thing.,587.219,1.502
"The Press Thank you, Sean.",588.721,2.569
What is the White House&amp;#39;s view if this does not pass,591.29,2.803
and there aren&amp;#39;t the votes?,594.093,1.268
What does this mean going forward for other pieces,595.361,2.302
of the President&amp;#39;s agenda -- tax reform,597.663,1.769
being the big one?,599.432,1.034
"Mr. Spicer: Look, I&amp;#39;ve said it before, I don&amp;#39;t",600.466,1.735
think you can tie any of these together.,602.201,2.069
That&amp;#39;s just not -- I think there&amp;#39;s a huge,606.872,1.869
appetite for tax reform.,608.741,3.17
And I&amp;#39;m not trying to juxtapose anything to do,611.911,3.804
with today&amp;#39;s vote or not.,615.715,1.001
I think it will be great to see it put forward.,616.716,2.702
The President has put a lot of time and effort,619.418,2.536
"into this, and I think he&amp;#39;s made a strong case as",621.954,3.937
"to why this has to happen, and I think we&amp;#39;ve",625.891,1.469
worked with the House.,627.36,0.667
If we don&amp;#39;t get -- regardless of what happens,628.027,3.537
today -- and I still feel optimistic that the,631.564,2.936
Speaker and the President and the Vice President --,634.5,3.237
we&amp;#39;ve got a team that&amp;#39;s been up on the Hill most,637.737,1.935
of today -- they&amp;#39;re going to continue to try to get,639.672,2.302
every vote they can.,641.974,0.834
But that doesn&amp;#39;t mean -- whether it&amp;#39;s immigration,642.808,3.27
"or tax reform, there&amp;#39;s still a huge",646.078,2.236
appetite out there.,648.314,1.101
"The Press Just to be clear, I mean, if this",649.415,3.537
"fails today, is the President done",652.952,2.135
with healthcare?,655.087,0.734
Mr. Spicer: So negative.,655.821,1.402
(Laughter.),657.223,0.667
The Press: That&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re hearing.,657.89,1.835
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re hearing?,659.725,1.602
"Well, I haven&amp;#39;t heard that yet, so why don&amp;#39;t we",661.327,3.67
"continue with a very positive,",664.997,2.269
optimistic Friday.,667.266,1.068
The sun is coming out.,668.334,2.703
(Laughter.),671.037,0.667
I feel really good.,671.704,2.002
So we&amp;#39;re going to continue to work as late as we can,673.706,2.769
to get the votes.,676.475,0.701
"And as I said, the upside is that we continue to",677.176,3.57
"pick up votes, people continue to say that they",680.746,2.469
"want to -- the question is, can we get to 2016.",683.215,2.703
"But make no mistake about it, the President made it",685.918,3.103
clear last night -- this is it.,689.021,1.969
You have an opportunity to do what you&amp;#39;ve told the,690.99,2.836
"American people, the commitment that we as a",693.826,1.902
"party have made, but this is your chance to do",695.728,3.37
what we&amp;#39;ve done.,699.098,0.667
"We&amp;#39;ve listened, we&amp;#39;ve incorporated, we&amp;#39;ve",699.765,2.136
updated in every way possible.,701.901,3.37
I don&amp;#39;t think -- when you look at legislative,705.271,1.768
"efforts, I think the President has given",707.039,1.335
it his all.,708.374,1.101
"And I think it shocked a lot of people, frankly,",709.475,3.036
"how very, very detail-oriented, how",712.511,3.27
personal it was for him -- calling members as,715.781,5.039
early as 6:00 a.m.,720.82,1.001
in the morning and going to 11 o&amp;#39;clock at night the,721.821,2.602
"last several nights, sitting down, meeting",724.423,1.902
"after meeting with them, coming back and revising",726.325,2.503
"it, having his team back and forth.",728.828,2.235
Everything is out there.,731.063,1.168
And I think each of these members needs to make the,732.231,2.436
"decision, whether or not they believe that they&amp;#39;ve",734.667,4.07
"-- at some point, you can only do so much, is what I",738.737,2.37
would honestly tell you.,741.107,1.134
And I think everything that we could possibly do,742.241,2.536
"to listen to members, to get their concerns in this",744.777,3.403
"piece of legislation, to make it as strong as",748.18,1.635
possible for the American people has been done.,749.815,2.636
The Press: But is the President comfortable then,752.451,1.468
with Obamacare continuing?,753.919,1.669
And what does he say to his supporters?,755.588,2.068
"Mr. Spicer: No, he&amp;#39;s not.",757.656,0.668
"I mean, of course, he&amp;#39;s not.",758.324,0.7
"The Press: I mean, they voted for him with the",759.024,1.335
promise that he would repeal this.,760.359,1.368
"Mr. Spicer: I mean, I&amp;#39;m not even sure where to",761.727,1.335
start with that.,763.062,0.667
"No, he&amp;#39;s not, which is why he&amp;#39;s literally put as much",763.729,1.902
effort as he has into repealing this.,765.631,2.536
"But he&amp;#39;s made it clear that this is our moment,",768.167,4.538
"this is our opportunity to do it, but it is now up to",772.705,3.17
members to make that decision whether or not,775.875,2.435
they want to be part of this effort to,778.31,1.335
repeal Obamacare.,779.645,0.701
And if they don&amp;#39;t -- and I think for a lot of the --,780.346,2.769
you saw the President&amp;#39;s tweet this morning -- I,783.115,1.568
think for a lot of these members who life is as,784.683,2.436
"important as well, this is your opportunity.",787.119,3.804
But it&amp;#39;s ultimately them that have to go down in,790.923,2.803
the floor and cast that vote.,793.726,1.134
And I think we&amp;#39;ve been able to cast a bunch of,794.86,3.47
votes over the past couple years when you knew a,798.33,1.869
President wouldn&amp;#39;t sign it.,800.199,1.468
You have a President that&amp;#39;s going to sign the,801.667,1.835
bill if you pass it.,803.502,2.236
And now is that time.,805.738,1.168
Zeke.,806.906,0.667
The Press: Some months ago at the Republican National,807.573,2.302
"Convention, the President said -- &amp;quot;I alone can fix it.&amp;quot;",809.875,3.037
"Throughout the entire campaign, his message to",812.912,2.135
"his voters, the American people, was, he&amp;#39;s a",815.047,2.436
"businessman, he knows how to get deals done, he",817.483,2.769
"knows how to break the gridlock in Washington,",820.252,2.436
he&amp;#39;s the &amp;quot;closer&amp;quot; is what you said,822.688,2.135
earlier this week.,824.823,0.935
"If this vote does go down, what does this say",825.758,3.036
about the President?,828.794,0.901
Is the President humbled by this process?,829.695,2.402
And will he readjust -- how will he readjust the,832.097,3.003
administration going forward?,835.1,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: Let&amp;#39;s not -- like I said to Jill,",835.768,1.701
I&amp;#39;m still optimistic.,837.469,1.235
I feel like we&amp;#39;re continuing to work hard.,838.704,2.369
"But at the end of the day, you can&amp;#39;t force somebody",841.073,3.37
to do something.,844.443,0.701
I think there&amp;#39;s nobody that objectively can look,845.144,4.304
at this effort and say the President didn&amp;#39;t do every,849.448,2.136
"single thing he possibly could, with his team, to",851.584,3.837
get every vote possible.,855.421,1.802
And I think that&amp;#39;s why I still feel,857.223,2.769
good about this.,859.992,1.702
"But we are where we are, and members have got to",861.694,2.135
make that decision for themselves.,863.829,1.335
This is the final hour to make that decision.,865.164,1.601
Blake.,866.765,0.668
"The Press: Sean, is it under any consideration to",867.433,2.302
pull the bill at all between now and then?,869.735,1.401
Mr. Spicer: You guys are so negative.,871.136,1.335
"The Press: Well, there&amp;#39;s reports out there that --",872.471,1.335
Mr. Spicer: I understand.,873.806,0.934
But there are reports out there -- the Speaker and,874.74,3.937
the President are talking now.,878.677,1.302
The Leader and the Whip are doing their,879.979,2.936
vote counts.,882.915,0.667
The debate is ongoing.,883.582,1.068
We&amp;#39;re going to continue -- we are proceeding with,884.65,2.302
a 3:30 p.m.,886.952,0.768
vote as scheduled.,887.72,0.767
John.,888.487,0.667
The Press: Take me through some of the -- if you,889.154,2.403
don&amp;#39;t mind -- the thinking yesterday when the bill,891.557,2.335
was pulled and then the President had made the,893.892,2.236
"decision -- or his team, they went to the Hill",896.128,2.903
"saying, there&amp;#39;s going to be a vote today.",899.031,1.768
At what point did he make that calculation?,900.799,1.635
Why did he make that calculation?,902.434,1.335
Can you bring us through some of that thinking?,903.769,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, I mean, there&amp;#39;s a",905.104,2.169
couple of things.,907.273,0.667
"One is, I think we wanted to be as open as possible",907.94,1.335
with the vote.,909.275,0.667
"Having it on the current trajectory last night, it",909.942,1.835
"was going into the wee hours of the morning, and",911.777,1.869
I don&amp;#39;t think that that -- for all that we&amp;#39;ve talked,913.646,2.602
"about, that wasn&amp;#39;t the appropriate way to vote.",916.248,2.202
I think we decided to work with the House and ask,918.45,3.037
that they postpone and make sure that it was done,921.487,2.803
in the light of day.,924.29,2.836
But I think that he&amp;#39;s had enough discussions.,927.126,1.701
And it is not about improving the,928.827,2.036
deal anymore.,930.863,0.834
I think he has taken into consideration every,931.697,3.47
"member&amp;#39;s thoughts and concerns, and relayed",935.167,2.503
those to the House.,937.67,0.967
And I think to the extent that this balance of,938.637,3.003
"trying to get to 216, in this case, is such that",941.64,4.672
there are some people that come in with ideas and,946.312,2.369
"say, if you do that to get your vote, I&amp;#39;m going to",948.681,1.835
"give up 26, or to get these three, I&amp;#39;m going",950.516,2.569
give up 12.,953.085,0.667
And I think we have struck the right balance right,953.752,3.437
"now and incorporated it, and it&amp;#39;s the strongest",957.189,1.969
possible bill.,959.158,2.002
But he&amp;#39;s going to continue to work as hard as he can,963.228,1.769
until the very end.,964.997,0.667
Charlie.,965.664,0.668
The Press: How important is a live vote to the White,966.332,2.135
House and to the President to see who&amp;#39;s on the side,968.467,1.335
and who&amp;#39;s not?,969.802,0.667
Mr. Spicer: We&amp;#39;ve seen the whip counts.,970.469,1.368
Mr. Scalise has done a phenomenal job with Leader,971.837,1.335
McCarthy of -- we know where the,973.172,1.334
vote count stands.,974.506,5.005
So we don&amp;#39;t need a live vote to tell us,984.583,2.87
where the votes are.,987.453,0.8
People have been pretty straightforward with where,988.253,2.036
they are and what their outstanding issues are.,990.289,1.468
The Press: The President and the Speaker are,991.757,2.169
meeting right now.,993.926,0.867
Do you know -- can you tell us anything about the,994.793,2.002
"character of that meeting, or what exactly they&amp;#39;re",996.795,3.37
looking at going forward?,1000.165,1.869
"Mr. Spicer: Well, they&amp;#39;re discussing,",1002.034,2.336
they&amp;#39;re not looking.,1004.37,1.434
They&amp;#39;re sitting down and talking about where it,1005.804,2.67
"stands, some of the outstanding issues, and",1008.474,2.002
whether they&amp;#39;re onesies or twosies or fives -- what,1010.476,2.702
are the concerned and outstanding issues of some,1013.178,2.937
"of the blocs and some of the individuals,",1016.115,1.501
and having a discussion on that.,1017.616,1.468
Anita.,1019.084,0.668
The Press: If the bill doesn&amp;#39;t pass --,1019.752,3.336
Mr. Spicer: There&amp;#39;s somebody that&amp;#39;s going to,1023.088,1.769
"ask when it passes, and you can --",1024.857,2.068
"The Press: Okay, well,",1026.925,1.602
do you want to have a briefing right after the vote?,1028.527,4.471
Mr. Spicer: No.,1032.998,1.201
The Press: Okay.,1034.199,1.235
(Laughter.),1035.434,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: All right, score one for you.",1036.101,2.97
(Laughter.),1039.071,0.667
"The Press: If the bill doesn&amp;#39;t pass,",1039.738,2.569
does the President still have confidence in,1042.307,2.837
the Speaker?,1045.144,0.8
Mr. Spicer: I think he answered that,1045.944,2.403
question earlier today.,1048.347,0.667
"The Press: Well, does he think that he should step",1049.014,1.368
down if it doesn&amp;#39;t get a vote?,1050.382,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: He answered that question earlier,",1051.049,1.335
and he said he did.,1052.384,0.667
"So, asked and answered.",1053.051,0.668
"The Press: And then, logistically today, after",1053.719,1.334
"the vote, whatever happens, how will we get a",1055.053,1.335
response from you all?,1056.388,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Electronically or verbally,",1057.055,1.936
but one of the two.,1058.991,1.168
Peter.,1060.159,0.667
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",1060.826,1.301
"This is the President&amp;#39;s first foray into, let&amp;#39;s",1062.127,2.603
"say, the sausage-making process, so to speak.",1064.73,2.369
Has he reflected at all on the experience?,1067.099,1.902
"I mean, how does he feel it differs from, for",1069.001,2.769
"example, negotiating a real estate deal,",1071.77,1.635
a business deal?,1073.405,0.834
Is it more complicated?,1074.239,1.101
Is it trickier?,1075.34,0.835
What&amp;#39;s his feeling about this?,1076.175,1.368
Mr. Spicer: I think we&amp;#39;ll have plenty of time to,1077.543,1.902
"reflect on it after we do this, so I know that --",1079.445,5.705
I&amp;#39;ll just leave it at that for now.,1085.15,1.702
Kristen.,1086.852,1.268
The Press: Thanks.,1088.12,1.501
Without prejudging the outcome of the vote --,1089.621,2.102
Mr. Spicer: Thank you.,1091.723,0.701
(Laughter.),1092.424,0.667
The Press: -- does the President in any,1093.091,1.335
"way regret pursuing healthcare first, given",1094.426,1.335
how complicated it has been?,1095.761,0.667
Mr. Spicer: No.,1096.428,0.667
"I think if you think about it legislatively, in order",1097.095,2.837
to maximize -- and I know for most people it doesn&amp;#39;t,1099.932,5.272
"make a ton of sense, but the savings that you",1105.204,2.502
achieve through the first reconciliation of,1107.706,1.902
"healthcare, which we&amp;#39;re doing through the 2017",1109.608,2.569
"budget process, which still continues, allows us",1112.177,3.47
to utilize the savings in that process to maximize,1115.647,5.906
additional tax reform measures that will start,1121.553,3.103
in the FY2018 reconciliation process.,1124.656,3.437
So while that sounds like a ton of inside-baseball,1128.093,2.703
"gobbledygook, the reality is, is that in order to",1130.796,2.736
"maximize tax reform both on the corporate side, to",1133.532,3.77
make our businesses more competitive and to give,1137.302,2.503
"individuals, especially middle-class Americans,",1139.805,1.968
more tax relief -- doing this in that way maximizes,1141.773,4.572
the amount of savings that you can use for the second,1146.345,5.071
"reconciliation package, which would be tax reform.",1151.416,2.336
"Doing it the first way, you can do -- but again,",1153.752,2.736
you&amp;#39;re not going to achieve the full potential,1156.488,3.704
that you could if you did it the way that,1160.192,1.702
is happening now.,1161.894,1.134
"But that being said, I mean, it&amp;#39;s not a question",1163.028,3.17
of -- we all knew how big this was -- it&amp;#39;s one-fifth,1166.198,2.235
of the economy -- and what it took.,1168.433,2.436
"The issue is, is that I think the disparate",1170.869,2.469
"interests that are there, and some of the",1173.338,4.171
"process-explaining, if you will -- the understanding",1177.509,3.137
"-- the way that this is happening, and I think,",1180.646,2.002
"legislatively, it&amp;#39;s complicated.",1182.648,2.068
"And for a lot of folks that just understand, why",1184.716,2.736
can&amp;#39;t you do it all in one fell swoop?,1187.452,1.836
What&amp;#39;s the Byrd Rule?,1189.288,0.934
What&amp;#39;s reconciliation?,1190.222,1.902
Why do you have to do it in three phases?,1192.124,2.002
"I think, for a lot of people, that is a little",1194.126,1.668
bit complicated to understand.,1195.794,1.568
And it&amp;#39;s not just a question of understanding.,1197.362,2.67
I think one of the other things that the President,1200.032,2.769
and the team have found is that there&amp;#39;s a lot of,1202.801,2.069
"issues where people are wondering, well, if I vote",1204.87,1.868
for this how can I guarantee that I get,1206.738,1.502
something in phase two -- which is the,1208.24,1.902
administrative pieces that Secretary Price,1210.142,3.27
would institute.,1213.412,0.901
"And then third is -- well, you know, the legislative",1214.313,2.202
"things that will take 60 votes, they complete the",1216.515,2.502
"overall package -- you know, how do I have -- and",1219.017,3.037
so there&amp;#39;s a lot of -- the comprehensive nature of,1222.054,3.603
this makes it very complicated.,1225.657,1.835
And I think that&amp;#39;s a lot different.,1227.492,1.335
"Normally, you have one bill that sails through,",1228.827,1.969
"and it deals with all of these things, and you",1230.796,1.735
can roll it all in.,1232.531,0.734
"If someone has an amendment, you add it in.",1233.265,1.601
"In this process, we&amp;#39;re having to have all these",1234.866,1.602
"one-off discussions about, you know, will the Senate",1236.468,2.536
"accept this if you put it in; if you put it in, will",1239.004,1.902
"they -- not only will they accept it, but will the",1240.906,2.602
Byrd Rule take place and kick out the whole thing.,1243.508,2.002
That complicates this,1245.51,2.369
probably like nothing else.,1247.879,1.402
The Press: Understood.,1249.281,0.701
"Just to put a fine point on it, though, was it his",1249.982,2.068
"initial ask to do healthcare first, or did",1252.05,1.902
"House Speaker Paul Ryan say, I think this is --",1253.952,2.336
"Mr. Spicer: I think was something that, during the",1256.288,2.235
"transition, we sat down and gamed out in",1258.523,2.803
coordination with the House in terms of what,1261.326,1.902
should go first and why.,1263.228,0.934
"But again, it&amp;#39;s not a question of just what",1264.162,1.569
"should go first, it&amp;#39;s a question of if you don&amp;#39;t",1265.731,2.569
"do it first, do you lose some of the potential in",1268.3,3.57
savings that you would achieve through the,1271.87,1.335
second reconciliation.,1273.205,1.635
The Press: Wouldn&amp;#39;t it have been wiser to try to work,1274.84,1.334
"with the Freedom Caucus, for example, on something",1276.174,1.569
like infrastructure reform to build up some goodwill,1277.743,3.536
"with that caucus, and then come back to something",1281.279,2.236
more complicated?,1283.515,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: No, I think -- look, Kristen, we&amp;#39;ve",1284.182,1.769
talked about this since 2010.,1285.951,1.101
"Every Republican, with the exception of probably a",1287.052,1.535
"handful, has campaigned from dog catcher on up",1288.587,3.403
that they would do everything they could to,1291.99,1.669
repeal and replace Obamacare.,1293.659,2.102
"And I think to get in and say, hey, you should have",1295.761,1.534
done something else wouldn&amp;#39;t be fair to the,1297.295,2.837
"American people who have said, okay, I&amp;#39;ll vote for",1300.132,2.235
you but I want you to fulfill this pledge.,1302.367,3.604
"The Press: And just finally, does the buck",1305.971,1.435
stop with him on this?,1307.406,1.334
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I mean -- like I said earlier,",1308.74,2.269
you can&amp;#39;t force someone to vote a certain way.,1311.009,2.403
"I think, in the sense that has he done every single",1313.412,2.235
"thing, has he pulled out every stop, has he called",1315.647,2.403
"every member, has he tweaked every tweak, has",1318.05,4.17
"he done every single thing he can possibly, and used",1322.22,3.938
every minute of every day that&amp;#39;s possible to get,1326.158,2.035
"this thing through, then the answer is yes.",1328.193,1.969
Has the team put everything out there?,1330.162,1.801
Have we left everything on the field?,1331.963,1.402
Absolutely.,1333.365,0.667
"But at the end of the day, this isn&amp;#39;t a dictatorship,",1334.032,2.736

"to -- you know, how they will according",1339.404,2.903
to what they think.,1342.307,0.667
"But I think they&amp;#39;re -- as the President made clear,",1342.974,1.669
they&amp;#39;re the ones who have to go back and answer to,1344.643,1.902
their constituents why they didn&amp;#39;t fulfill a,1346.545,2.102
pledge that they made.,1348.647,1.034

that Chairman Nunes received or was alerted to,1364.763,3.57
these documents from someone at the White House?,1368.333,2.636
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not aware of where he got,1370.969,1.769
the documents from.,1372.738,0.734
I don&amp;#39;t know.,1373.472,0.667
The Press: Can you rule out that it came from,1374.139,1.568
the White House?,1375.707,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I can&amp;#39;t -- I don&amp;#39;t know where,1376.374,1.402
he got them from.,1377.776,0.701
He didn&amp;#39;t state it.,1378.477,1.401
So I don&amp;#39;t have anything for you.,1379.878,2.936
And so I cannot say anything more than,1382.814,3.437
I don&amp;#39;t know at this point.,1386.251,1.268
Cecilia.,1387.519,0.667
The Press: So if the President has done,1388.186,1.702
"everything he can possibly do, and the Speaker has",1389.888,2.402
"done everything he can possibly do, the team has",1392.29,2.57
"put everything on the table, who is to blame",1394.86,2.235
"right now for this hold-up, in your eyes?",1397.095,1.535
"Mr. Spicer: Well, again, let&amp;#39;s wait and see how",1398.63,1.702
this thing -- I&amp;#39;m not assigning blame.,1400.332,1.334
"The Press: Well, but you wanted a vote even last",1401.666,2.203
"night or this morning, so there is a stall.",1403.869,2.002
So from last night to this morning --,1405.871,1.334
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, no, we did want a vote last night,",1407.205,1.402
"and I think,",1408.607,0.667
"as I have mentioned, as we got into the evening",1409.274,1.502
"hours, the idea wasn&amp;#39;t to bury this at",1410.776,2.502
12:00 a.m. or 1:00 a.m. in the morning.,1413.278,1.502
"The Press: Initially, you were asking for one",1414.78,1.668
"yesterday, and there was a statement from your press",1416.448,1.802
office that asked for one this morning.,1418.25,2.035
"Mr. Spicer: No, no -- and I&amp;#39;m not backing away from that.",1420.285,3.37
We wanted a vote yesterday.,1423.655,1.401
"But as the process went on, we realized that that",1425.056,2.737
"vote would occur in -- probably, actually, into",1427.793,3.436
"today, in terms of like calendar-wise, and that",1431.229,3.47
"doing it at 1:00 a.m., 2:00 a.m., 3:00 a.m.",1434.699,2.103
in the morning was not something that would be in,1436.802,2.102
keeping with what we had promised.,1438.904,1.334
The Press: So who is to blame for the stall right now?,1440.238,1.735
Is it the Freedom Caucus? Is it --,1441.973,1.368
Mr. Spicer: I think it&amp;#39;s not a blame.,1443.341,1.335
"Right now, it&amp;#39;s a question of getting all these",1444.676,1.468
members together and dealing with all -- I,1446.144,2.069
"mean, you&amp;#39;ve seen the activity.",1448.213,1.368
You&amp;#39;ve seen the members go back and forth.,1449.581,2.236
"Right now, we&amp;#39;re still in that active discussion",1451.817,4.07
phase with trying to figure out who we can get,1455.887,1.969
on board and whether or not we can move forward.,1457.856,1.768
But this is -- we&amp;#39;re not there yet.,1459.624,2.536
The Press: But you put this ultimatum out there.,1462.16,1.802
"Is the President, right now, still confident that",1463.962,1.568
he can see this bill through -- that you will,1465.53,1.969
repeal and replace Obamacare?,1467.499,0.801
Mr. Spicer: The President is confident that we have,1468.3,1.801
"done every single thing possible, made the case,",1470.101,3.971
"updated it, added and done everything to listen to",1474.072,4.037
the concerns and to do everything that fulfills,1478.109,1.936
the promises that we and members have made with,1480.045,3.87
the American people.,1483.915,0.868
John.,1484.783,0.667
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",1485.45,1.435
"Without prejudging the outcome of the vote today,",1486.885,4.638
but focusing on your comments and the,1491.523,3.27
"President&amp;#39;s, saying this would be a vote against",1494.793,3.57
life if people vote against it --,1498.363,2.069
Mr. Spicer: Right.,1500.432,0.667
The Press: -- several Republican members said,1501.099,2.136
they did not want the vote on Planned Parenthood,1503.235,2.769
in this particular bill.,1506.004,2.002
Congressman John Faso of New York was,1508.006,3.47
particularly outspoken.,1511.476,1.001
Did anything come up in the negotiation or from,1512.477,3.17
the White House saying they guarantee a separate,1515.647,3.604
vote on Planned Parenthood and leave it,1519.251,2.369
out of the bill?,1521.62,0.734
"Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not aware of that, John.",1522.354,2.035
I&amp;#39;m not aware that that happened.,1524.389,1.468
The Press: The White House -- from your tone and the,1525.857,2.002
"President&amp;#39;s, the White House wanted the Planned",1527.859,1.869
Parenthood vote in?,1529.728,0.901
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;d have to go back and look at --,1530.629,3.069
there&amp;#39;s a lot of discussions that go on.,1533.698,1.435
I honestly can&amp;#39;t remember how or when that came up.,1535.133,2.77
The Press: The other thing I wanted to ask was that,1537.903,2.135
the last two members who announced they were no --,1540.038,4.504
"Chris Smith and Frank LoBiondo, Republicans of",1544.542,2.269
New Jersey -- both cited the number of Medicaid,1546.811,3.771
recipients in their district as their premier reason.,1550.582,3.37
"Congressman LoBiondo said in three counties, 30",1553.952,2.936
percent of his constituents were on,1556.888,2.536
"Medicaid, and he wanted no damage.",1559.424,2.503
Was there anything discussed on Medicaid?,1561.927,2.502
Was it on the table in the negotiations?,1564.429,3.37
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I know that that there was a",1567.799,2.336
discussion about the expansion of Medicaid and,1570.135,3.069
some of the work requirements with respect,1573.204,1.769
to able-bodied Americans who are receiving that.,1574.973,2.869
"But I would say this, John -- one of the things that",1577.842,3.804
-- not member-specific to either of the members from,1581.646,2.169
New Jersey -- is that members have to understand,1583.815,3.804
that the current system is unsustainable.,1587.619,2.903
"So if you vote no today, then what is your",1590.522,2.702
"alternative, and what do you want?",1593.224,2.737
Because right now there&amp;#39;s a lot of folks that have,1595.961,3.636
"said they&amp;#39;re going to vote no, which is their",1599.597,3.604
"prerogative, but at the end of the day, the",1603.201,2.102
current Obamacare system will collapse on its own.,1605.303,3.07
And so the question that they have to ask,1608.373,2.035
themselves or that they are going to be asked by,1610.408,1.969
"their constituents is, then what is",1612.377,1.935
your alternative?,1614.312,0.701
Because right now this is the choice that,1615.013,2.602
will save the system.,1617.615,1.769
"The other choice is to do nothing, and that will",1619.384,2.436
-- that is going to collapse the system.,1621.82,1.801
Eamon.,1623.621,0.668
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1624.289,0.934
The stock market has been largely looking at this as,1625.223,2.136
a proxy for how you&amp;#39;re going to do on your,1627.359,2.435
tax cut proposal.,1629.794,0.734
Would you be able to say what the lessons learned,1630.528,2.47
here are about how this was handled that might,1632.998,2.202
apply to the tax cut proposal?,1635.2,1.468
"Mr. Spicer: Look, Eamon, I&amp;#39;ve discussed this earlier.",1636.668,2.069
I&amp;#39;m not going to start getting a &amp;quot;lessons,1638.737,1.801
learned&amp;quot; while we&amp;#39;re in the middle of debate,1640.538,2.269
of a current bill.,1642.807,1.101
We&amp;#39;ll have plenty of time -- if you want to stop by,1643.908,2.203
"over the weekend, we can talk about --",1646.111,1.334
(laughter),1647.445,0.701
-- to sit down with you on that.,1648.146,2.569
"But again, we&amp;#39;re not -- right now we&amp;#39;re focused",1650.715,3.037
on getting the votes.,1653.752,1.301
The House has a vote scheduled.,1655.053,3.804
That&amp;#39;s what our focus is -- not to figure out --,1658.857,2.636
we&amp;#39;ll have plenty of time for that.,1661.493,1.334
Jen.,1662.827,0.668
The Press: Is the President going to just simply wash,1663.495,1.434
his hands of this today if this doesn&amp;#39;t go his way?,1664.929,2.536
"Mr. Spicer: Look, we&amp;#39;re not -- the President is",1667.465,1.335
"going to wash his hands several times, but I don&amp;#39;t",1668.8,2.369
know -- (laughter).,1671.169,0.667
The Press: The central campaign promise of the,1671.836,1.335
President of the United States --,1673.171,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: I understand that, and so what -- I get it.",1674.506,2.836
So slow down.,1677.342,0.867
"Let&amp;#39;s turn on C-SPAN and all watch this together,",1678.209,2.736
and then we can discuss what happened.,1680.945,1.735
Jen.,1682.68,0.668
The Press: Treasury Secretary Mnuchin was,1683.348,1.735
talking this morning about doing tax reform by,1685.083,2.336
the August recess.,1687.419,1.201
Do you think that that&amp;#39;s a reasonable timeline?,1688.62,3.103
And why the rush?,1691.723,1.568
Are there any lessons learned from this,1693.291,2.77
healthcare debate?,1696.061,0.767
"Mr. Spicer: Again, I think tax reform is something",1696.828,3.67
that we&amp;#39;ve talked about.,1700.498,1.435
There&amp;#39;s plenty of time.,1701.933,1.068
"I think it&amp;#39;s a goal, and I think it&amp;#39;s an ambitious",1703.001,2.069
one and I think it&amp;#39;s one that we&amp;#39;re going to,1705.07,4.437
try to stick to.,1709.507,1.735
"But let&amp;#39;s get by today, and then we&amp;#39;ll lay it out.",1711.242,2.102
But I think tax reform is something that the,1713.344,1.769
President is very committed to.,1715.113,1.335
You&amp;#39;ve seen him very publicly in the last,1716.448,2.302
couple of open events talk about how excited he is to,1718.75,4.104
move on once this is done to tax reform.,1722.854,3.003
Because he understands both sides of this -- that,1725.857,3.103
the business piece of this -- we are so uncompetitive,1728.96,3.737
when it comes to our other worldly competitors in,1732.697,2.803
"terms of our tax rate, and yet when we have these",1735.5,2.869
discussions about keeping companies from either,1738.369,2.503
shipping jobs overseas or growing -- bringing back,1740.872,3.47
"jobs to America, the two things that come up over",1744.342,3.203
and over again are our tax rate and our,1747.545,2.169
regulatory system.,1749.714,1.301
"And I think he understands that on the tax front, we",1751.015,2.169
can be a lot more competitive with the rest,1753.184,3.737
of the world in growing American jobs here at home,1756.921,2.903
"and, frankly, expanding manufacturing if we lower",1759.824,5.172
"that, but also that the American middle class",1764.996,2.636
"desperately needs and wants a tax break, and I",1767.632,4.271
think the more that we can do with that -- so this is,1771.903,1.802
something that I think we&amp;#39;re going to be,1773.705,1.768
"continuing to work on, and we&amp;#39;ll have more on that later.",1775.473,3.137
Trey.,1778.61,0.667
"The Press: Sean, how much credit will the President",1779.277,1.368
take for the outcome of this healthcare bill?,1780.645,1.635
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m going to refer you to like the,1782.28,3.704
last eight people.,1785.984,0.934
Let&amp;#39;s see where we go from here.,1786.918,2.336
The Press: Quick follow-up?,1789.254,1.234
Mr. Spicer: Yes.,1790.488,0.801
The Press: Is the White House still as confident,1791.289,1.335
"as they were earlier in this week, and is the",1792.624,2.135
President still as confident as he was,1794.759,1.835
earlier in the week that this healthcare,1796.594,1.835
bill will pass?,1798.429,0.801
Mr. Spicer: I would suggest to you it&amp;#39;s -- my,1799.23,2.436
answer that I said to Kristen is that we are,1801.666,3.203
"confident that we have done everything, and it",1804.869,2.936
is now up to voters.,1807.805,1.068
The President -- we -- the President called for a,1808.873,2.436
"vote, and respectfully -- obviously, it&amp;#39;s not up to",1811.309,3.07
"us, but the reason that he asked Speaker Ryan and",1814.379,2.769
Leader McCarthy to call for a vote is,1817.148,1.935
we&amp;#39;ve done everything.,1819.083,1.135
We&amp;#39;ve done every single thing that -- every,1820.218,2.369
"meeting, every call, every discussion, every idea has",1822.587,5.772
"been out there, adjudicated, listened to.",1828.359,3.871
And I think that now is the time for the vote.,1832.23,2.002
"And so we&amp;#39;re a couple hours away, and",1834.232,2.102
let&amp;#39;s see where we go.,1836.334,0.801
The Press: -- level of confidence remain?,1837.135,1.902
"Mr. Spicer: I think in the sense of what we did, yes.",1839.037,2.836
Peter.,1841.873,0.667
"The Press: Sean, the President can order every",1842.54,2.136
surveillance transcript that mentions himself or,1844.676,2.936
his associates in regards to Russia for the,1847.612,2.002
investigation that he called for to be brought,1849.614,1.902
to his desk at any time.,1851.516,1.401
Has he done that?,1852.917,0.968
Mr. Spicer: No.,1853.885,0.701
The Press: So yesterday you were asked specifically --,1854.586,2.202
you said that the concerns should be less about the,1856.788,1.601
process and more about the substance.,1858.389,1.502
I asked because that would be one way to get directly,1859.891,2.302
to the substance.,1862.193,0.768
"On the substance, Devin Nunes said initially that",1862.961,4.371
he -- there was evidence that &amp;quot;clearly showed that,1867.332,2.602
the President-elect and his team were,1869.934,1.335
at least monitored.&amp;quot;,1871.269,1.134
"Then today he said --, asked if Trump or his",1872.403,3.437
"associates were monitored or mentioned, he said,",1875.84,1.668
we don&amp;#39;t know.,1877.508,1.202
We won&amp;#39;t know until we actually receive all,1878.71,1.968
the documentation.,1880.678,0.734
The President said he&amp;#39;s somewhat vindicated.,1881.412,2.603
So given the fact that Devin Nunes doesn&amp;#39;t,1884.015,1.868
actually know if the President was monitored or,1885.883,2.269
"whether he was even mentioned, what is",1888.152,1.469
he vindicated by?,1889.621,0.934
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think that there has been an",1890.555,1.535
acknowledgement that there are documents out there,1892.09,3.136
showing that people were surveilled or monitored,1895.226,3.27
to some degree.,1898.496,0.667
The Press: They could have exclusively been,1899.163,2.103
"foreigners, Devin Nunes concedes.",1901.266,1.334
Mr. Spicer: Devin Nunes also made it clear that,1902.6,1.735
he&amp;#39;s going to have a hearing later next week,1904.335,2.369
with several members of the intelligence community,1906.704,2.603
and calling others back.,1909.307,1.568
And so let&amp;#39;s wait and see --,1910.875,1.835
"The Press: Well, what is the President vindicated by?",1912.71,4.204
Mr. Spicer: The President said he felt somewhat,1916.914,1.335
vindicated because I think that there is an,1918.249,1.368
acknowledgement that he&amp;#39;s -- that as we proceed down,1919.617,2.102
"this discussion, it continues to show that",1921.719,3.17
"there was something there, and that despite the",1924.889,3.804
constant discussion about the process --,1928.693,1.902
The Press: But he said we don&amp;#39;t -- we won&amp;#39;t know.,1930.595,1.702
"Mr. Spicer: Hold on, Peter.",1932.297,0.667
I understand.,1932.964,0.667
I get this is -- I understand that.,1933.631,2.67
And he also said that he&amp;#39;s going to have a hearing,1936.301,1.568
"and he&amp;#39;s going to call the people back, and he&amp;#39;s",1937.869,1.535
waiting for the documents.,1939.404,1.368
So let&amp;#39;s wait and let that process evolve.,1940.772,2.102
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",1942.874,1.935
A couple questions.,1944.809,0.934
First about Keystone.,1945.743,1.902
What changed?,1947.645,0.834
It seemed like it took forever in covering the,1948.479,2.269
Obama administration for this thing to finally get,1950.748,2.469
over the finish line.,1953.217,1.235
It never did.,1954.452,0.901
And relatively quickly -- less than 65 days in --,1955.353,3.17
it&amp;#39;s finally made its way over the finish line.,1958.523,2.102
"What changed, especially with respect to the State",1960.625,2.402
Department&amp;#39;s view of the Keystone XL pipeline?,1963.027,3.137
And is it your opinion that it would be good to,1966.164,1.835
"hear from the President -- win, lose, or draw --",1967.999,3.27
after what we learned today vis-à-vis,1971.269,2.102
healthcare reform?,1973.371,1.401
"Mr. Spicer: So, simply put, on Keystone,",1974.772,3.337
it was a priority.,1978.109,0.701
"I mean, the President came in, he signed an",1978.81,1.501
executive order on it.,1980.311,1.335
He had talked about it during the campaign and he,1981.646,3.136
made it a priority.,1984.782,0.768
He made it a priority for his team here at the White,1985.55,2.536
House to get it done -- not only the jobs but,1988.086,4.137
incorporating U.S.,1992.223,0.801
steel and -- there was a lot of things.,1993.024,2.602
But I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s any simpler than he made it a,1995.626,2.103

He recognizes the importance of that to both,2004.369,2.435
"energy and to jobs and our economy,",2006.804,1.869
and simply got it done.,2008.673,1.468
"And I&amp;#39;ll leave it up to the President, once we go",2010.141,2.202
"forward, to see how it goes.",2012.343,0.734
Margaret.,2013.077,0.668
"The Press: Sean, as a dealmaker, why does the",2013.745,1.835
President feel that this take-it-or-leave-it,2015.58,2.035
approach is the right one on healthcare?,2017.615,3.137
Mr. Spicer: Because I think he has done -- I,2020.752,3.303
"mean, at some point you&amp;#39;ve listened to everybody,",2024.055,3.47
"you&amp;#39;ve gotten all other ideas, you&amp;#39;ve gone back",2027.525,3.37
"and forth, you have incorporated them, you&amp;#39;ve",2030.895,2.469
"assuaged them in some way, shape, or form; you&amp;#39;ve",2033.364,3.003
"updated the bill -- and a lot of times, it&amp;#39;s the",2036.367,2.069
same people coming back over and over again.,2038.436,2.502
"And you go, okay, I&amp;#39;ve listened to you,",2040.938,2.47
I&amp;#39;ve taken your ideas.,2043.408,1.668
"At some point, we either have a deal or we don&amp;#39;t.",2045.076,2.235
And I think that&amp;#39;s where the President finally drew,2047.311,1.435
the line and said we&amp;#39;ve been having this,2048.746,1.702
"discussion, we&amp;#39;ve had the meetings, and we&amp;#39;ve done",2050.448,4.171
everything possible to address the concerns and,2054.619,4.037
ideas and opinions that people have brought up.,2058.656,3.203
"And I mean, I don&amp;#39;t think you can",2061.859,3.237
say it any simpler.,2065.096,0.734
"I think he has done every single thing possible, and",2065.83,2.436
"you end up, at some point, finding yourself going",2068.266,2.402
"around and around and saying, okay, let&amp;#39;s just",2070.668,2.669
-- let&amp;#39;s call the vote.,2073.337,0.668
The Press: But isn&amp;#39;t there a political cost to a,2074.005,2.502
"collapse, potentially?",2076.507,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: I think that, at some point, there&amp;#39;s a",2077.175,1.968
"political cost to dragging this out, as well, and",2079.143,2.97
"saying, let&amp;#39;s just keep letting it go.",2082.113,2.035
"And I think that&amp;#39;s where -- you know, we came to a",2084.148,3.237

Kaitlan.,2091.456,0.667
"The Press: If there&amp;#39;s a collapse, though, isn&amp;#39;t",2092.123,1.468
"there a cost that the President will, at some",2093.591,2.302
"point, have to pay for?",2095.893,1.435
If it&amp;#39;s either --,2097.328,1.168
Mr. Spicer: In terms of what?,2098.496,1.735
The Press: The collapse that you have been,2100.231,1.868
predicting --,2102.099,1.268
"Mr. Spicer: No, I think that --",2103.367,0.901
"look, remember -- look, this is --",2104.268,1.335
"The Press: Besides the upcoming election in 2018, I&amp;#39;m talking",2105.603,2.703
"about economic impact, all the impact on the states --",2108.306,1.701
there will be a cost.,2110.007,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: I get it, and I think that we&amp;#39;ll have to",2110.675,5.005
look at the landscape.,2119.884,0.667
"But at some point -- you know, I think right now",2120.551,1.335
Democrats made a decision during this debate that,2121.886,1.368
they wanted to stick by Obamacare.,2123.254,1.335
"I think, at some point -- the President has talked",2124.589,1.334
about this -- that this is going to collapse.,2125.923,1.335
"And let&amp;#39;s see where this thing heads, but I think,",2127.258,3.37
"right now, we have a plan on the table that allows",2130.628,3.937
for a solution that will address all of the,2134.565,1.936
"concerns that, frankly, were initially brought up",2136.501,4.304
as far as what the Affordable Care Act,2140.805,1.835
was supposed to do.,2142.64,0.868
Kaitlan.,2143.508,0.667
The Press: So if you know what the vote counts are,2144.175,2.035
"right now, and there&amp;#39;s no discussion of pulling the",2146.21,2.636
"healthcare bill, and it gets closer to 3:30 p.m.",2148.846,2.77
"and you still don&amp;#39;t have the votes, why vote?",2151.616,2.769
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to discuss our strategy.,2154.385,2.236
I mean --,2156.621,0.667
"The Press: But you see what I&amp;#39;m saying, right?",2157.288,1.535
Mr. Spicer: I do.,2158.823,0.901
The Press: If you know what the votes are and you know,2159.724,1.368
"that you don&amp;#39;t have the votes for it to pass,",2161.092,2.536
why vote?,2163.628,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I understand your question.,2164.295,2.936
I&amp;#39;m just not going to comment on our strategy.,2167.231,1.669
I think the President and the Speaker are going to,2168.9,2.569
have a discussion about where those votes are and,2171.469,2.602
"what some of the members needs are, and we&amp;#39;ll",2174.071,2.736
take it from there.,2176.807,0.668
Athena.,2177.475,0.7
The Press: You talked about all the work that the,2178.175,2.336
President and his team have put into this -- the,2180.511,2.803
"early-morning calls, late calls.",2183.314,1.335
"The other day, one of the members of Congress who",2184.649,2.569
was here to meet with the President -- Congressman,2187.218,2.536
"McHenry -- called -- said, we&amp;#39;re bringing him",2189.754,1.568
to &amp;quot;the closer.&amp;quot;,2191.322,0.834
You embraced that nickname from the podium.,2192.156,3.137
"Whatever happens today, do you still feel comfortable",2195.293,2.002
calling the President &amp;quot;the closer&amp;quot; when it comes to,2197.295,2.535
deal-making on all this?,2199.83,1.102
"Mr. Spicer: Look, I think I said to Christian and a",2200.932,2.302
"couple others, I think he has done",2203.234,1.335
everything possible.,2204.569,0.667
"There is no one, either on Capitol Hill or any honest",2205.236,2.869
"observer of what&amp;#39;s happened, that doesn&amp;#39;t",2208.105,1.669
recognize the extraordinary feats.,2209.774,2.102
"But at some point, as I&amp;#39;ve mentioned, this isn&amp;#39;t",2211.876,3.403
a one-on-one negotiation.,2215.279,2.136
"This is -- you know, you have to get to 216.",2217.415,3.37
And I don&amp;#39;t -- I think part of this question is,2220.785,3.703
"to go to some of those &amp;quot;no&amp;#39;s&amp;quot; and ask them, what",2224.488,2.603
is the reason and what would you do?,2227.091,1.969
"And the probably is, is that, as I&amp;#39;ve mentioned",2229.06,1.668
"before, there is this balancing act, where to",2230.728,2.336
"get these two members, you&amp;#39;re giving up 14.",2233.064,3.803
But we&amp;#39;re doing everything possible to get to that 216.,2236.867,4.805
And that -- I don&amp;#39;t -- I think when you actually,2241.672,3.537
objectively look at the effort that was,2245.209,2.236
"undertaken, there is no question that every single",2247.445,2.435
thing that has been done has been done to maximize,2249.88,4.405
the vote count on this.,2254.285,0.834
"The Press: And to be very, very clear -- this has",2255.119,1.835
"been addressed a few times, but I want to",2256.954,1.468
get a clearer answer.,2258.422,0.968
"You talked a lot about how this is the chance, this",2259.39,2.369
is an opportunity for Republicans to make good,2261.759,2.302
on campaign promises.,2264.061,0.734
"I asked the President a couple days ago, what",2264.795,2.269
happens when you keep pushing if,2267.064,1.502
this fails today.,2268.566,0.734
"And he said, we&amp;#39;ll wait and -- we&amp;#39;ll have to",2269.3,2.502
see what happens.,2271.802,0.734
Are you saying right now that there will be no,2272.536,3.737
future attempts to comply with that campaign promise,2276.273,2.737
if today&amp;#39;s attempt fails?,2279.01,1.167
Mr. Spicer: I can&amp;#39;t say that there&amp;#39;ll never be --,2280.177,2.236
"and again, I&amp;#39;m not going to be fatalistic when",2282.413,1.768
we&amp;#39;ve got a vote at 3:30 p.m.,2284.181,1.869
I know that the President has made it clear that,2286.05,1.835
"this is the effort, this was the train that&amp;#39;s",2287.885,1.635
"leaving the station, and that he expects everyone",2289.52,2.503
"-- you know, this is our opportunity.",2292.023,2.002
And he&amp;#39;s got a lot left on the agenda that he wants,2294.025,2.335
"to get done, whether it&amp;#39;s immigration, taxes,",2296.36,4.638
the border wall.,2300.998,1.235
There&amp;#39;s so many other things that he wants to,2302.233,2.035
get done that we&amp;#39;re not going to sit around and,2304.268,4.238
"figure out -- this is the opportunity, this is the",2308.506,2.269
"time, this is the opportunity for every",2310.775,2.135
member who has said that they want to repeal and,2312.91,2.236
replace Obamacare to put their vote in,2315.146,2.335
the &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; column.,2317.481,0.668
The Press: And last one.,2318.149,0.667
If it does pass today -- you&amp;#39;ve talked a lot about,2318.816,2.236
"this being done in three phases, today",2321.052,1.701
being phase one.,2322.753,1.168
"Phase two and phase three, one of the problems, I",2323.921,2.302
"think, is that this is not information that is in",2326.223,2.803
score-able form -- the steps that Secretary Price,2329.026,2.269
"might take, and then what may end up in",2331.295,2.236
this final bill.,2333.531,0.767
Is there any attempt being done --,2334.298,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I don&amp;#39;t know yet.",2335.633,1.334
"At some point, maybe it can -- I mean --",2336.967,1.335
The Press: Can you put the administrative steps,2338.302,1.335
that Secretary Price --,2339.637,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know. That&amp;#39;s --,2340.304,1.368
The Press: I that something that&amp;#39;s being,2341.672,1.335
attempted to be done?,2343.007,0.667
Because that&amp;#39;s the kind of information,2343.674,1.335
I think members want.,2345.009,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: I think, right now, we&amp;#39;re",2345.676,1.335
focused on the vote.,2347.011,0.667
But I think that we&amp;#39;ll have either OMB or CBO,2347.678,1.335
"take a look at not just the other elements, but",2349.013,3.637
can you look at it in its totality.,2352.65,2.702
I don&amp;#39;t know that that&amp;#39;s -- but that&amp;#39;s a good,2355.352,1.602
question that I can have the OMB folks address,2356.954,3.17
potentially with the CBO folks.,2360.124,2.703
"Thank you, guys.",2362.827,0.5
I&amp;#39;m sure we&amp;#39;ll have some additional updates today.,2363.327,2.302
Thank you.,2365.629,0.401
