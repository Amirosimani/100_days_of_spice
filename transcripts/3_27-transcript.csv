Mr. Spicer: Good afternoon.,0,0.834
"I hope everyone had a great weekend, seriously.",0.834,2.669
"It&amp;#39;s Monday, so I brought a special guest.",3.503,4.671
"First, I&amp;#39;d like to have the Attorney General come",8.174,4.705
up to the podium to make an announcement regarding,12.879,1.702
immigration enforcement with respect,14.581,2.068
to sanctuary cities.,16.649,1.435
"When the Attorney General is done speaking, we&amp;#39;ll",18.084,1.802
have time for a couple questions and then I&amp;#39;ll,19.886,2.97
continue with the briefing.,22.856,1.234
So if your question is not germane to sanctuary,24.09,2.736
"cities, keep your hand down and we&amp;#39;ll get to it",26.826,2.57
after we go through the events of the day.,29.396,3.003
"So, with that, Attorney General Sessions, come on up.",32.399,1.768
"Attorney General Sessions: Thank you, Sean.",34.167,2.169
The Department of Justice has a view to enforce our,42.742,2.469
"nation&amp;#39;s laws, including our immigration laws.",45.645,3.67
Those laws require us to promptly remove aliens,49.315,2.937
when they are convicted or detained of certain crimes.,52.252,3.603
The vast majority of American people support,55.855,3.237
this commonsense requirement.,59.092,2.402
"According to one recent poll, 80 percent of",61.494,2.803
Americans believe that cities that arrest illegal,64.297,5.205
immigrants for crimes should be required to turn,69.502,2.937
them over to immigration authorities.,72.439,2.702
"Unfortunately, some states and cities have adopted",75.141,3.103
policies designed to frustrate this enforcement,78.244,3.204
of immigration laws.,81.448,1.935
This includes refusing to detain known felons on the,83.383,3.937
"federal detainer request, or otherwise failing to",87.32,3.237
comply with these laws.,90.557,2.535
"For example, the Department of Homeland",93.092,1.769
Security recently issued a report showing that in a,94.861,3.704
"single week, there were more than 200 instances of",98.565,4.804
jurisdictions refusing to honor ICE detainer,103.369,3.204
requests with respect to individuals charged,106.573,3.303
or convicted of a serious crime.,109.876,2.669
The charges and convictions against these,112.545,2.536
"aliens included drug-trafficking,",115.081,3.47
"hit-and-run, rape, sex offenses against a child,",118.551,3.304
and even murder.,121.855,1.434
Such policies cannot continue.,123.289,3.204
They make our nation less safe by putting dangerous,126.493,3.269
criminals back on the streets.,129.762,2.47
"We all remember the tragic case of Kate Steinle, the",132.232,3.803
32-year-old woman who was shot and killed two years,136.035,3.27
ago in San Francisco as she walked along a pier,139.305,3.437
with her father.,142.742,1.301
"The shooter, Francisco Sanchez, was an illegal",144.043,3.103
immigrant who had already been deported five times,147.146,3.804
and had seven felony convictions.,150.95,3.003
"Just 11 weeks before the shooting, San Francisco",153.953,3.971
"had released Sanchez from its custody, even though",157.924,4.404
Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers had,162.328,3.17
filed a detainer requesting that he be held,165.498,3.937
in custody until immigration authorities,169.435,2.703
could pick him up for removal.,172.138,2.603
"Even worse, Sanchez admitted the only reason",174.741,2.302
he came to San Francisco was because it was,177.043,3.136
a sanctuary city.,180.179,1.869
"A similar story unfolded just last week, when Ever",182.048,3.103
"Valles, an illegal immigrant and a Mexican",185.151,3.337
national was charged with murder and robbery of,188.488,4.037
a man at a light rail station.,192.525,2.569
Valles was released from a Denver jail in late,195.094,2.903
"December, despite the fact that ICE has lodged a",197.997,3.504
detainer for his removal.,201.501,2.536
The American people are not happy with these results.,204.037,3.603
They know that when cities and states refuse to help,207.64,3.304
"enforce immigration laws, our nation is less safe.",210.944,4.437
Failure to deport aliens who are convicted of,215.381,2.903
"criminal offenses puts whole communities at risk,",218.284,3.871
especially immigrant communities in the very,222.155,2.536
sanctuary jurisdictions that seek to protect,224.691,4.471
the perpetrators.,229.162,1.067
"DUIs, assaults, burglaries, drug crimes,",230.229,3.137
"gang rapes, crimes against children, and murderers --",233.366,4.538
countless Americans would be alive today and,237.904,2.502
countless loved ones would not be grieving today if,240.406,3.47
these policies of sanctuary cities were ended.,243.876,3.971
Not only do these policies endanger lives of every,247.847,3.17
"American -- just last May, the Department of Justice",251.017,3.837
inspector general found that these policies also,254.854,3.57
violate federal law.,258.424,2.069
"The President has rightly said, disregard for",260.493,3.871
the law must end.,264.364,2.469
"In his executive order, he stated that it is the",266.833,3.103
policy of the executive branch to ensure that,269.936,3.704
"states and cities comply with all federal laws,",273.64,3.803
including all immigration laws.,277.443,3.137
"Today, I&amp;#39;m urging states and local jurisdictions to",280.58,5.172
"comply with these federal laws, including 8",285.752,3.703
U.S.C. Section 1373.,289.455,3.504
"Moreover, the Department of Justice will require",292.959,2.869
that jurisdictions seeking or applying for Department,295.828,3.737
of Justice grants to certify compliance with,299.565,3.671
1373 as a condition of receiving those awards.,303.236,5.739
This policy is entirely consistent with the,308.975,3.036
Department of Justice&amp;#39;s Office of Justice,312.011,2.569
Program&amp;#39;s guidance that was issued just last,314.58,3.404
summer under the previous administration.,317.984,3.537
This guidance requires state and local,321.521,2.536
jurisdictions to comply and certify compliance,324.057,4.204
with Section 1373 in order to be eligible for OJP grants.,328.261,6.072
It also made clear that failure to remedy,334.333,2.336
"violations could result in withholding grants,",336.669,4.071
"termination of grants, and disbarment or",340.74,2.903
ineligibility for future grants.,343.643,2.302
The Department of Justice will also take all lawful,345.945,4.037
steps to claw back any funds awarded to a,349.982,3.104
jurisdiction that willfully violates 1373.,353.086,4.671
"In the current fiscal year, the Department of",357.757,2.135
Justice&amp;#39;s Office of Justice Program and,359.892,2.77
Community Oriented Policing services,362.662,2.536
anticipates awarding more than $4.1 billion in grants.,365.198,4.304
I strongly urge our nation&amp;#39;s states and cities,369.502,5.305
and counties to consider carefully the harm they,374.807,3.637
are doing to their citizens by refusing to,378.444,3.37
"enforce our immigration laws, and to",381.814,2.536
rethink these policies.,384.35,2.469
Such policies make their cities and states less,386.819,3.237
"safe -- public safety, as well as national security,",390.056,3.737
are at stake -- and put them at risk of losing,393.793,3.57
federal dollars.,397.363,1.402
The American people want and deserve a lawful,398.765,3.136
"system of immigration that keeps us safe, and one",401.901,3.57
that serves the national interest.,405.471,2.503
"This expectation is reasonable, just, and our",407.974,3.904
"government has the duty to meet it, and we will meet it.",411.878,4.571
Thank you.,416.449,3.904
"The Press: In Montgomery County, right up the road,",420.353,2.502
there was a rape in Maryland at,422.855,2.836
Rockville High School.,425.691,1.068
Has anyone from the Department of Justice had,426.759,2.503
any conversations with anyone in Montgomery,429.262,2.168
"County or Rockville, as they describe themselves",431.43,3.037
as a sanctuary county and city?,434.467,1.401
And there&amp;#39;s also a boatload of federal,435.868,2.069
government in Montgomery County.,437.937,2.836
"Attorney General Sessions: Well, you know, Maryland",440.773,0.734
is talking about a state law to make the state,441.507,2.77
a sanctuary state.,444.277,2.102
"The governor is opposed to that, I&amp;#39;m glad to hear.",446.379,3.503
That would be such a mistake.,449.882,2.269
I would plead with the people of Maryland to,452.151,2.269
understand that this makes the state of Maryland more,454.42,4.037
at risk for violence and crime.,458.457,2.703
It is not good policy.,461.16,1.869
And as a former prosecutor for many years in state,463.029,3.503
"and federal law in jurisdictions, I just know",466.532,4.371
the historic relationship different federal agencies,470.903,3.57
have with regard to honoring detainers.,474.473,3.304
It&amp;#39;s just a fundamental principle of law,477.777,2.269
"enforcement that if you have a person arrested,",480.046,3.17
"and another jurisdiction has a charge, then",483.216,3.203
they file a detainer.,486.419,2.035
"And when you finish with the prisoner, you turn",488.454,2.269
them over to the next jurisdiction for,490.723,2.402
their adjudication.,493.125,2.503
That is why it should be done --,495.628,4.705
Mr. Spicer: Major.,500.333,1.301
"The Press: Mr. Attorney General, so listening to",501.634,1.368
"you carefully, it sounds like you&amp;#39;re applying the",503.002,2.769
standards and the policy that the Obama,505.771,2.436
administration put forward on compliance with,508.207,4.271
underlying Justice Department rules.,512.478,1.902
Are you taking any additional steps?,514.38,1.535
And have you asked the President to maybe talk,515.915,2.703
about other federal funds that are not necessarily,518.618,2.269
under your control as a way to punish sanctuary,520.887,2.602
cities or states?,523.489,1.301
"Attorney General Sessions: Well, that&amp;#39;s a good question.",524.79,1.268
What I&amp;#39;m saying today is that essentially the,526.058,2.77
policies of the Obama administration that were,528.828,2.736
issued last July make clear that you should not,531.564,3.637
be receiving certain federal funds if you&amp;#39;re,535.201,2.936
not in compliance with 1373.,538.137,2.603
We believe that grants in the future could be issued,540.74,3.403
"that have additional requirements, as every",544.143,2.402
grant that&amp;#39;s being issued in America today usually,546.545,2.737
has a requirement that if you qualify for this,549.282,3.236
"grant, you have to meet certain requirements.",552.518,2.936
"So we&amp;#39;ll be looking at that in the future, and",555.454,2.169
we&amp;#39;ll continue to pursue it.,557.623,1.869
But fundamentally we intend to use all the,559.492,2.769
lawful authority we have to make sure that our,562.261,4.838
"state and local officials, who are so important to",567.099,3.971
"law enforcement, are in sync with the",571.07,2.069
federal government.,573.139,6.54
"The Press: Some officials in cities, for example --",579.679,0.834
"bigger cities -- have said, despite the lack of",580.513,1.935
"federal funding, they will continue to be sanctuary",582.448,1.802
cities; that they don&amp;#39;t care that they&amp;#39;re losing,584.25,1.768
"money, essentially.",586.018,1.168
What recourse does the Department of Justice have,587.186,1.668
in those cities that look at what you&amp;#39;re doing and,588.854,2.937
"say, we don&amp;#39;t care, we&amp;#39;re going to continue to",591.791,1.601
implement this policy?,593.392,1.035
"Attorney General Sessions: Well, that&amp;#39;s very",594.427,1.234
"disheartening, but I hope that the American people",595.661,3.037
and their constituents in their own cities will,598.698,2.736
communicate with them.,601.434,1.768
"And as we continue a dialogue and a discussion,",603.202,3.237
and as we continue to ensure that monies that go,606.439,3.703
for law enforcement only go to cities who are,610.142,2.837
"participating in an effective, collegial,",612.979,3.036
"cooperative way with the federal government,",616.015,2.669
that that would also send a message.,618.684,2.202
We have simply got to end this policy.,620.886,4.205
Thank you all.,625.091,0.834
Mr. Spicer: Okay.,633.699,0.434
You guys ready to continue?,634.5,0.868
The Press: Yes.,635.368,0.5
Mr. Spicer: Good.,635.868,1.201
"Before I get into today&amp;#39;s schedule, I wanted to read",637.069,2.336
-- I know there&amp;#39;s been some interest in the State,639.405,1.501
Department&amp;#39;s statement regarding the arrest of,640.906,2.97
hundreds of protestors -- peaceful protestors --,643.876,2.769
that occurred in Russia.,646.645,1.569
The statement that the State Department put out,648.214,1.601
says: &amp;quot;The United States strongly condemns the,649.815,2.603
detention of hundreds of peaceful protestors,652.418,2.436
throughout Russia on Sunday.,654.854,1.601
"The detention of peaceful protestors, human rights",656.455,2.269
"observers, and journalists is an affront to essential",658.724,2.736
democratic values.,661.46,1.335
We are troubled to hear of the arrest of the,662.795,1.501
opposition leader upon arrival at the,664.296,3.204
"demonstration, as well as the police raids on the",667.5,3.169
anti-corruption organization he heads.,670.669,2.169
"The United States will monitor the situation, and",672.838,2.403
we call on the government of Russia to immediately,675.241,2.302
release all peaceful protestors.,677.543,2.236
"The Russian people, like people everywhere, deserve",679.779,2.936

"Between them, they provide hundreds of jobs to",751.884,2.469
Americans across the country.,754.353,1.835

"including access to capital, markets,",761.627,2.402

the most significant threats to growing,858.224,2.535

unique challenges of their own populations.,891.123,2.503
The President firmly believes that Washington,893.626,1.801
"is not always the solution to these problems, and",895.427,2.236
that these bills return the power to the people,897.663,2.402

teacher preparation and programs.,930.663,2.302
Removing these additional layers of bureaucracy will,932.965,2.235
"make it easier for parents, teachers and",935.2,2.203
"communities, and state leaders to address the",937.403,2.569
needs of their students.,939.972,1.601
The President will continue to work with,941.573,1.402
Congress and the rest of the federal government,942.975,1.868
until every unnecessary regulation that stands in,944.843,2.47
the way of success for American business and,947.313,2.602
American people is taken off the books.,949.915,2.87
"Additionally, the President spoke with",952.785,1.401
German Chancellor Merkel and Indian Prime Minister,954.186,2.436
Modi earlier today to congratulate them on their,956.622,2.736
parties&amp;#39; success in recent elections.,959.358,2.502
We&amp;#39;ll have readouts on those calls a little,961.86,1.635
later for you both.,963.495,1.402
The President also will announce the establishment,964.897,3.236
of the Office of American Innovation.,968.133,3.037
The Office of American Innovation will apply the,971.17,2.002
President&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;ahead of schedule and under budget&amp;quot;,973.172,1.935
mentality to a wide number of government operations,975.107,2.869
"and service, enhancing the quality of life",977.976,2.37
for all Americans.,980.346,1.434
The office will have a particular focus on,981.78,1.702
"technology and data, hearing back from leaders",983.482,2.669
in the industry.,986.151,0.668
"As some of its first priorities, the office",986.819,2.702
will focus on modernizing the technology of every,989.521,3.27
"federal department, identifying",992.791,2.603
"transformational infrastructure projects,",995.394,2.636
and reimagining the VA system so that it can,998.03,2.569
better serve our nation&amp;#39;s heroes.,1000.599,2.469
The effort will be led by Assistant to the President,1003.068,2.069
and Senior Adviser Jared Kushner.,1005.137,2.202
"Tomorrow, the President will sign an executive",1007.339,1.902
order to strengthen the nation&amp;#39;s energy security,1009.241,2.669
by reducing unnecessary regulatory obstacles that,1011.91,3.671
restrict the responsible use of domestic,1015.581,2.636
energy resources.,1018.217,1.468
This order will help keep energy and electricity,1019.685,2.269
"affordable, reliable and clean in order to boost",1021.954,3.637
economic growth and job creation.,1025.591,2.636
"And finally, before I came out today, Senate",1028.227,1.935
Democrats continued their obstruction to the,1030.162,2.236
President&amp;#39;s nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the,1032.398,3.303
Supreme Court with the Judiciary Committee,1035.701,2.369
seeking a one-week postponement,1038.07,1.635
on its decision.,1039.705,1.334
"Over the weekend, Senate Minority Leader Chuck",1041.039,2.002
Schumer defended his decision to mount a,1043.041,2.336
filibuster against the President&amp;#39;s unquestionably,1045.377,2.836
qualified nominee.,1048.213,1.602
"If Senator Schumer gets his way, this would be the",1049.815,1.868
first successful filibuster against a,1051.683,2.57
Supreme Court nominee in American history.,1054.253,3.203
"He argued, quite misleadingly, that the",1057.456,3.37
Senate has &amp;quot;required&amp;quot; a 60-vote threshold of,1060.826,3.971
&amp;quot;every&amp;quot; Supreme Court nominee.,1064.797,2.102
That&amp;#39;s simply not true.,1066.899,1.902
"And as I&amp;#39;ve said before, only three Supreme Court",1068.801,2.035
Justices have faced a filibuster in the last,1070.836,2.936
half of the century.,1073.772,1.201
Senator Schumer cited four justices confirmed under,1074.973,2.837
"President Bush and Obama, but in fact, among those",1077.81,3.336
"four, only one faced an attempted filibuster --",1081.146,3.103
that was Justice Samuel Alito.,1084.249,1.368
"And it was President Obama who, then as a senator,",1085.617,3.237
"voted to filibuster Justice Alito, and later",1088.854,3.37
publicly expressed his regret for that.,1092.224,2.302
"The fact is, an attempted filibuster of a Supreme",1094.526,2.469
"Court nominee is rare, and to do so in this context,",1096.995,3.471
with such an eminently qualified and brilliant,1100.466,2.769
"judge, is nothing short of obstructionism.",1103.235,3.403
"That&amp;#39;s why Senator Pat Leahy, the former",1106.638,2.236
"Democratic Chairman of the Senate Judiciary, said he",1108.874,2.202
"is &amp;quot;not inclined to filibuster,&amp;quot; even if he",1111.076,3.904
ultimately may not vote to confirm the Judge.,1114.98,3.003
The fact that the former Chairman of the Judiciary,1117.983,2.402
Committee won&amp;#39;t stand by the Minority Leader,1120.385,2.103
exposes the Leader&amp;#39;s efforts as nothing but,1122.488,2.002
obstructionism that undermines decades,1124.49,3.169
of Senate tradition.,1127.659,1.468
"Through four days of extensive hearings, Judge",1129.127,2.536
"Gorsuch demonstrated his judicial philosophy, his",1131.663,3.404
"sterling academic credentials, and a",1135.067,1.968
brilliant legal mind.,1137.035,1.569
He deserves a fair up or down vote.,1138.604,2.535
"And with that, I&amp;#39;d be glad to take a few",1141.139,1.969
of your questions.,1143.108,0.768
Jonathan.,1143.876,2.502
The Press: Is the President serious about,1146.378,1.602
working with Democrats going forward after what,1147.98,2.235
happened with healthcare?,1150.215,2.002
Mr. Spicer: Absolutely.,1152.217,0.768
"In fact, starting Friday afternoon through late",1152.985,4.437
"yesterday, he&amp;#39;s received a number of calls, as well",1157.422,2.47
as other members of the senior staff that had been,1159.892,2.869
"working on healthcare, from members of both",1162.761,3.27
"sides, saying that they would like to work",1166.031,2.469
"together, offer up ideas, and had suggestions about",1168.5,3.337
how to come to resolution on this and get to a,1171.837,3.97
House vote on this.,1175.807,1.302
The Press: But --,1177.109,1.668
The Press: But wouldn&amp;#39;t this require a --,1178.777,0.968
"Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sorry, John, this isn&amp;#39;t a free-for-all.",1179.745,2.369
Jonathan is asking the question.,1182.114,1.435
The Press: But wouldn&amp;#39;t this require a serious,1183.549,1.234
course correction for the White House?,1184.783,2.136
"I mean, the President branded Chuck Schumer a",1186.919,2.102
"&amp;quot;clown,&amp;quot; worked entirely with Republicans",1189.021,4.905
on this bill.,1193.926,1.134
Wouldn&amp;#39;t this require a serious change of course,1195.06,2.236
for the President?,1197.296,1.334
"Mr. Spicer: To some degree, sure.",1198.63,1.135
And I think the President talked about that.,1199.765,1.134
I think we learned a lot through this process.,1200.899,3.837
I think we&amp;#39;re obviously looking at ways that we,1204.736,2.536
"can improve not only how we handle healthcare, but",1207.272,1.802
other things -- how we do everything.,1209.074,2.469
And I mentioned it to some of you in the,1211.543,1.802
course of things.,1213.345,0.667
I think one of the traits of a successful,1214.012,2.169
"organization is to always examine how you do things,",1216.181,3.003
but I think that there&amp;#39;s been a lot of outreach,1219.184,1.869
"from members of both sides with ideas, and the",1221.053,1.701
President is willing to listen to,1222.754,1.802
these individuals.,1224.556,0.834
And if they can come to a resolution on a way,1225.39,1.902
"forward, obviously we&amp;#39;re willing to listen",1227.292,2.903
and to move forward.,1230.195,0.734
But there are a lot of folks that came forward,1230.929,3.203
with these ideas.,1234.132,0.701
"And with all due respect, to the beginning of your",1234.833,1.735
"question, I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a one-way street some",1236.568,2.269
of the comments that have been made.,1238.837,1.335
I think some of the Democrats.,1240.172,1.835
"who now say they weren&amp;#39;t involved, early on in the",1242.007,2.336
process said that they wanted nothing to do with,1244.343,2.369
"this process, there was no way that they would engage",1246.712,3.536
in any discussion to repeal.,1250.248,1.836
"So I think it&amp;#39;s a two-way street, and I think that",1252.084,1.935
we have been willing to listen to folks,1254.019,1.335
and their ideas.,1255.354,1.067
And the President&amp;#39;s advice is that if we can come up,1256.421,2.169
"with resolution on a way to move forward, we&amp;#39;ll",1258.59,2.169
certainly entertain that.,1260.759,1.468
The Press: Where does the buck stop,1262.227,0.768
for this failure?,1262.995,0.8
Does the buck stop --,1263.795,0.868
Mr. Spicer: Just so we&amp;#39;re,1264.663,0.934
"clear, look, we&amp;#39;re at the beginning of a process.",1265.597,2.803
I don&amp;#39;t think we&amp;#39;ve seen the end of healthcare.,1268.4,2.869
"As most people have noted, I think the Obama",1271.269,1.869
"administration, from beginning to end, it",1273.138,3.203
ultimately took about 17 months and went through a,1276.341,2.036
series of fits and starts.,1278.377,1.701
"And it wasn&amp;#39;t until Scott Brown was elected, denying",1280.078,3.27
"them the 60th vote in the Senate, that they finally",1283.348,2.336
jammed something through.,1285.684,1.268
"And, frankly, a lot of the reason that the Secretary",1286.952,3.904
of Health and Human Services has some of the,1290.856,1.802
powers that they do is because they had to,1292.658,2.168
jam it through.,1294.826,0.668
"But there were several failures, when Obamacare",1295.494,3.603
"went through, during the process.",1299.097,2.336
"And ultimately, they tried to go through a",1301.433,1.635
"single-payer process, and they got rebuffed on that",1303.068,2.202
by some of their own members.,1305.27,2.503
"So, look, we&amp;#39;re not saying it&amp;#39;s the",1307.773,2.602
end of healthcare.,1310.375,0.901
But I think that we are looking to look for a way,1311.276,2.669
"forward, and I think that a lot of the members --",1313.945,3.104
"and again, on both sides of the aisle -- have",1317.049,1.267
"reached out not just to the President, but to",1318.316,1.469
"members of the team, willing to share some",1319.785,2.502
ideas both that will make -- that they think would,1322.287,3.937
make the bill stronger.,1326.224,1.368
"But ultimately, the goal is to get to 216 and",1327.592,3.037
"potentially 218, depending on where we are with",1330.629,1.768
special elections.,1332.397,2.236
And so we&amp;#39;re going to look to see where we can get,1334.633,2.202
those 218 votes.,1336.835,1.368
And there may be other opportunities to work with,1338.203,2.169
people across the aisle that get us to 218.,1340.372,2.602
"But that&amp;#39;s the name of the game, and we&amp;#39;re going to",1342.974,1.902
continue to pursue that.,1344.876,1.635
Jim.,1346.511,0.668
"The Press: Sean, the last Congress passed",1347.179,2.335
"significant tax reform, it took about five years, and",1349.514,2.97
"that was 30 years ago, in 1986.",1352.484,1.868
After the failure or defeat of the American,1354.352,2.036
Health Care Act on an issue where there was,1356.388,2.202
"broad GOP consensus, what makes the President think",1358.59,2.936
he can pass significant tax reform this year?,1361.526,3.437
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think it&amp;#39;s been 30 years.",1364.963,1.401
I think people -- we have a series of -- we have an,1366.364,2.169
"economy that&amp;#39;s evolved, especially in the",1368.533,2.57
technology area; they just made a lot,1371.103,1.534
of things change.,1372.637,1.068
And I think our tax code is outdated.,1373.705,2.069
"And, frankly, on the business side,",1375.774,2.002
we&amp;#39;re uncompetitive.,1377.776,1.401
There&amp;#39;s a reason that companies are leaving,1379.177,2.169
"America to go to other places, because the same",1381.346,2.503
reason sometimes companies move from state to state.,1383.849,2.435
Our corporate and regulatory system has,1386.284,1.936
become unattractive for a lot of companies that want,1388.22,2.736
"to either manufacture here, grow here, or begin",1390.956,2.602
"here, or want to return jobs here.",1393.558,2.736
"I think the President recognized that, and",1396.294,1.702
business leaders from around the country.,1397.996,2.202
It&amp;#39;s not a partisan issue.,1400.198,1.101
"I mean, you go out to the tech sector, out in",1401.299,3.37
"Silicon Valley in particular, there&amp;#39;s a lot",1404.669,2.103
of these companies out there that admittedly,1406.772,1.868
"weren&amp;#39;t with the President during the election, or",1408.64,2.803
"continued not to be, and I think recognized that we",1411.443,4.204
are not as competitive as we can be when you,1415.647,3.237
consider the tax and regulatory climate of,1418.884,2.769
other countries around the world.,1421.653,1.535
And we need to be more competitive.,1423.188,1.435
And then I think you look at the individual side of,1424.623,2.169
"the House, and I think especially when you talk",1426.792,2.235
"to middle-income Americans, especially in",1429.027,4.438
"the context of health premiums skyrocketing up,",1433.465,2.769
they recognize that they need some relief.,1436.234,2.169
And so we&amp;#39;ve got to do what we can,1438.403,2.269
to address that.,1440.672,0.667
Jon-Christopher.,1441.339,0.668
The Press: Thank you.,1442.007,0.667
"Historically, since healthcare has beguiled",1442.674,5.339
"many Presidents, all the way to Harry Truman, and",1448.013,2.869
certainly when Hillary Clinton came to,1450.882,2.169
"Washington, she went to the Hill and thought that",1453.051,2.202
she could get it done.,1455.253,1.635
I&amp;#39;m sure there are many lessons you can learn from,1456.888,2.269
previous Presidents and,1459.157,1.168
perhaps previous First Ladies.,1460.325,1.969
Has the President thought about reaching out to,1462.294,2.502
Hillary and finding out how she maneuvered and,1464.796,2.369
some of the best practices or some of the pitfalls,1467.165,3.804
that she came to?,1470.969,1.201
"Mr. Spicer: And I think that you know -- I mean,",1472.17,1.602
he&amp;#39;s met with Dr. Zeke Emanuel and others -- it&amp;#39;s,1473.772,2.302
not been a -- he&amp;#39;s reached out to several people,1476.074,3.07
throughout this process to gauge both their policy,1479.144,2.903
ideas and strategy ideas.,1482.047,1.568
And I think the President noted on Friday afternoon,1483.615,2.703
"that we learned a lot, on several fronts, about",1486.318,3.47
"strategically how to handle this, as well as",1489.788,1.668
some of the members that we thought we,1491.456,3.137
would have with us.,1494.593,1.434
And we&amp;#39;re reexamining that on a variety of bases.,1496.027,2.303
Margaret.,1498.33,1.268
The Press: Thank you.,1499.598,1.868
We got some guidance from the White House earlier,1501.466,3.07
about Chairman Nunes&amp;#39;s meeting on the White House,1504.536,3.537
"grounds, involving (inaudible) any idea that",1508.073,4.237
questions about the meeting should be referred,1512.31,2.069
to the Committee Chairman.,1514.379,2.436
But I wanted to ask a slightly different,1516.815,1.835
"question, which is, does the White House know now",1518.65,3.437
what absolutely happened?,1522.087,3.069
"Do you have issues with the idea that someone,",1525.156,4.238
"perhaps in the executive branch, shared information",1529.394,3.57
from the White House grounds without you,1532.964,1.769
knowing about it?,1534.733,1.067
Or are you investigating this?,1535.8,1.469
Do you believe there was a leak?,1537.269,1.267
"Or was it, in fact, someone on the White House",1538.536,3.304
"staff or NSC staff, or on loan to either, who",1541.84,3.303
provided the information and therefore,1545.143,1.635
it&amp;#39;s not leaked?,1546.778,2.302
"Mr. Spicer: So, obviously, all of what I know has",1549.08,2.036
been available through public comments.,1551.116,2.235
I know that Chairman Nunes confirmed that he was on,1553.351,3.337
White House grounds Tuesday.,1556.688,2.269
"And, frankly, any questions regarding who he",1558.957,2.002
met with or why he was here should be,1560.959,1.802
referred to him.,1562.761,0.667
I&amp;#39;ve seen some of the comments that he&amp;#39;s made to,1563.428,2.503
your outlet in particular about who he met with.,1565.931,3.236
And I would refer you to his comments,1569.167,3.504
that he&amp;#39;s made.,1572.671,0.667
I&amp;#39;m not going to get into who he met with or why he,1573.338,2.803
met with them.,1576.141,0.667
I think that&amp;#39;s something that he had made very,1576.808,1.602
"clear, and I&amp;#39;ll let him answer it.",1578.41,2.435
He is the one who has discussed what,1580.845,3.737
he is reviewing.,1584.582,2.37
And so I will leave it up to him and not try to get,1586.952,2.202
in the middle of that.,1589.154,1.301
"The Press: Can I just follow up, just to close",1590.455,1.001
the circle on it?,1591.456,0.667
"I&amp;#39;m asking a slightly different question, or at",1592.123,2.002
least I&amp;#39;m trying to ask a slightly different,1594.125,1.335
"question, which is, does the White House know what",1595.46,3.47
"happened now, beyond public accounts?",1598.93,2.002
And are you satisfied that you don&amp;#39;t have an,1600.932,2.269
inappropriate leak in the executive branch?,1603.201,1.935
"Mr. Spicer: No, we&amp;#39;re not concerned about that.",1605.136,2.403
"I know that he is -- again, everything that I",1607.539,2.436
know about what he has done is through public,1609.975,4.104
reports that he has made on the record to different,1614.079,1.935
"folks when he said he has multiple sources, he had",1616.014,2.469
met with different folks to gather things as part,1618.483,3.403
of his review of the situation.,1621.886,1.602
"And so all I know, and what I&amp;#39;m willing to",1623.488,2.836
"communicate, is what has been made available",1626.324,2.569
through on-the-record comments that he has made.,1628.893,2.57
The Press: But to come to White House grounds you,1631.463,1.134
have to be cleared --,1632.597,0.367
"Mr. Spicer: No, not necessarily.",1632.964,1.335
I don&amp;#39;t know that members of Congress need,1634.299,1.101
to be cleared.,1635.4,1.335
The Press: Wouldn&amp;#39;t the White House want to know?,1636.735,1.368
"Mr. Spicer: Again, I think there&amp;#39;s a difference.",1638.103,2.068
"He&amp;#39;s doing a review, and it&amp;#39;s not something that",1640.171,2.503
we&amp;#39;re going to necessarily get in the middle of or,1642.674,1.702
get in the way of.,1644.376,1.001
Part of it is to let him review and have,1645.377,3.37
conversations and look at things that he,1648.747,1.501
thinks are relevant.,1650.248,0.868
"The Press: Sean, a clarification on your",1651.116,2.335
answer to Margaret.,1653.451,0.668
"You said, I don&amp;#39;t know that members of Congress",1654.119,1.735
have to get cleared in.,1655.854,0.934
There was some question about that.,1656.788,1.335
"Who in the White House signed him in,",1658.123,1.768
"essentially, to be able to --",1659.891,0.734
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know that you have to.,1660.625,0.901
I&amp;#39;ll be glad to check on that.,1661.526,1.435
I&amp;#39;m not sure that that&amp;#39;s how that works.,1662.961,1.568
But I will follow up on that point.,1664.529,3.303
"The Press: Okay, and my second question is -- and",1667.832,1.202
it&amp;#39;s related to this -- I understand that you&amp;#39;re not,1669.034,1.167
going to speak about some of the swirl surrounding,1670.201,4.305
this issue with Chairman Nunes.,1674.506,1.434
Does the White House believe that he can still,1675.94,2.67
lead an impartial investigation?,1678.61,2.169
Or would the administration support,1680.779,1.501
some of these calls now for an independent,1682.28,1.602
committee to investigate this?,1683.882,2.669
"Mr. Spicer: First of all, I would question",1686.551,1.702
what &amp;quot;this&amp;quot; is.,1688.253,0.634
Because as I&amp;#39;ve mentioned countless times from this,1688.887,2.636
"podium, there&amp;#39;s two issues at hand --",1691.523,2.202
there&amp;#39;s multiple.,1693.725,1.368
"Number one, there&amp;#39;s any action with respect",1695.093,2.035
to Russia itself.,1697.128,0.768
And every single person that&amp;#39;s been briefed by,1697.896,3.003
"Director Comey in particular, and the FBI,",1700.899,1.835
has said there&amp;#39;s nothing there.,1702.734,1.568
What he is looking into are two things that we are,1704.302,3.103
aware of because of the pleas that we have made.,1707.405,2.469
One is the leaks of classified and other,1709.874,2.97
information that have come out.,1712.844,1.268
And two is whether or not there has been people that,1714.112,6.406
"have been unmasked, and whether or not there was",1720.518,1.769
surveillance -- I don&amp;#39;t know why -- we stand by,1722.287,2.836
the original request that was made.,1725.123,1.902
"And I think Director Comey, in open testimony",1727.025,2.335
"the other day, talked about what the FBI",1729.36,1.535
is looking into.,1730.895,0.668
So I think we have a lot of people looking into,1731.563,3.236
this whole situation.,1734.799,0.934
"The Press: Will the administration pursue,",1735.733,3.871
will the White House pursue a leak,1739.604,0.701
investigation into whoever is giving Chairman Nunes,1740.305,2.235
"this information, if it&amp;#39;s in the executive branch?",1742.54,2.036
"Mr. Spicer: At this point, we&amp;#39;re letting his -- the",1744.576,2.602
review of this situation proceed.,1747.178,2.77
And we can address that after he decides to be,1749.948,1.968
clear about that.,1751.916,1.569
"The Press: Why is this leak okay, but other",1753.485,1.434
leaks are not?,1754.919,0.834
Mr. Spicer: I think there&amp;#39;s a difference,1755.753,1.068
between a leak and someone pursuing a review of a,1756.821,2.703
situation that they have determined.,1759.524,1.835
There&amp;#39;s a difference between a leak -- someone,1761.359,2.269
leaking out to reporters for nefarious -- to take,1763.628,2.803
classified information and share it with people,1766.431,2.035
who aren&amp;#39;t cleared.,1768.466,0.968
Chairman Nunes is cleared; he&amp;#39;s the Chairman of the,1769.434,3.07
Intelligence Committee.,1772.504,1.001
Someone who is cleared to shared classified,1773.505,2.102
information with somebody else cleared,1775.607,1.701
is not a leak.,1777.308,0.668
Zeke.,1777.976,0.667
The Press: I have two for you.,1778.643,0.901
Just a quick housekeeping note.,1779.544,1.034
"At the beginning of the briefing, you read out",1780.578,1.802
that the State Department stated on the protests,1782.38,2.669
and arrests in Russia.,1785.049,1.001
Does that reflect the White House&amp;#39;s views?,1786.05,1.168
Mr. Spicer: That reflects the view of the United,1787.218,2.436
States government.,1789.654,0.901
"The Press: Okay, just wanted to clarify that.",1790.555,1.101
"And secondly, back on -- you mentioned there were",1791.656,2.035
"lessons learned off of what went down last week,",1793.691,3.704
"the last several weeks, around healthcare.",1797.395,1.168
Can you give us some specifics on what some of,1798.563,2.035
those lessons are in terms of the President talked a,1800.598,2.202
"lot about he learned a lot about loyalty, I think is",1802.8,1.736
one of the lines he stated on Friday?,1804.536,1.501
Does he believe that some members of his party are,1806.037,2.569
no longer loyal to him?,1808.606,1.168
Will you go through what are some of,1809.774,1.368
the lessons that --,1811.142,0.601
"Mr. Spicer: No, I&amp;#39;m not going to detail,",1811.743,2.135
"go through -- I mean, obviously this is",1813.878,1.101
an internal thing.,1814.979,1.135
But I will say that we look at things like --,1816.114,3.737
everything from who we met with and when we met with,1819.851,2.502
"them, to whether or not we should have -- how",1822.353,3.671
everything was rolled out and what organizations,1826.024,2.002
"were met with, what commitments were",1828.026,2.169
met and when.,1830.195,0.767
But there&amp;#39;s a lot that goes into this.,1830.962,1.468
And you look at whether or not that&amp;#39;s applicable to,1832.43,2.035
"another situation, whether that&amp;#39;s unique.",1834.465,2.503
"But obviously, yeah, you do look at some of the",1836.968,1.902
"individuals that you met with, both in terms of",1838.87,2.469
"timing, in terms of commitment, in terms of",1841.339,1.935
"substance, and evaluate just the process itself,",1843.274,5.439
"but then also, to some degree, the individuals",1848.713,2.736
and whether or not that is someone that --,1851.449,3.537
The Press: Who&amp;#39;s leading that review?,1854.986,1.101
Mr. Spicer: There&amp;#39;s several folks.,1856.087,1.034
"Again, it depends on the aspect of it.",1857.121,1.836
"There&amp;#39;s a legislative affairs team, there&amp;#39;s a",1858.957,1.468
"public policy team, there&amp;#39;s a comms",1860.425,2.169
aspect to this.,1862.594,0.8
"But we all internally talk about what went well,",1863.394,2.636
what didn&amp;#39;t.,1866.03,0.668
"And we do that not just with the bad,",1866.698,1.334
but the good.,1868.032,0.668
"I mean, I think Jonathan asked it somewhere at the",1868.7,2.102
"beginning, but I think most organizations --",1870.802,3.904
whether or not you do something really well or,1874.706,1.768
not as well -- it&amp;#39;s usually incumbent upon you,1876.474,2.436
"to think, what did we do well so that for things",1878.91,2.235
"that we did really well, we sustain those kinds of",1881.145,2.369
aspects of something -- because there&amp;#39;s always,1883.514,2.169
something to improve -- and even when you,1885.683,1.335
don&amp;#39;t do as well.,1887.018,0.667
But there&amp;#39;s part of things that you did that you did,1887.685,3.837
well and you don&amp;#39;t want to throw the baby out,1891.522,1.335
with the bath water.,1892.857,0.667
So there&amp;#39;s an ongoing piece to this.,1893.524,1.435
Major.,1894.959,1.235
The Press: Just a quick follow-up on Chairman,1896.194,1.535
"Nunes, and then I have a question about",1897.729,1.434
Jared in a second.,1899.163,1.035
"So, yes, members of Congress may not need to",1900.198,3.036
"be cleared in, but to get access to a SCIF, I do",1903.234,2.269
believe that requires some cooperation from the,1905.503,2.703
"executive branch, because there are intelligence",1908.206,1.968
"places on Capitol Hill that are secure, that his",1910.174,2.236
meeting could have taken place.,1912.41,1.501
So it creates the impression that Chairman,1913.911,2.57
"Nunes came over here and, with some degree of",1916.481,2.903
"cooperation with this White House, was able to",1919.384,2.602
carry out this meeting and then make the announcement,1921.986,2.836
"that he did, which is perceived by some -- most",1924.822,2.77
"of them Democrats, I&amp;#39;ll grant you that -- that it",1927.592,1.968
was trying to be helpful to this President and,1929.56,2.603
this administration.,1932.163,0.567
So it appears there was some degree of cooperation,1932.73,2.67
in this process that the White House granted,1935.4,2.736
"Chairman Nunes, making it not just an investigative",1938.136,3.303
"action, but a cooperative one.",1941.439,1.535
Mr. Spicer: Right.,1942.974,0.767
So I would refer you to two things.,1943.741,1.201
"Number one, we&amp;#39;ve asked both of these entities,",1944.942,2.47
both the House and the Senate Intelligence,1947.412,1.334
"Committees, to undertake this review.",1948.746,1.702
So it is partially at our request that they&amp;#39;re,1950.448,2.502
looking into this.,1952.95,1.035
"Number two, based on the public comments that he",1953.985,4.037
"made to Margaret&amp;#39;s organization, he has said,",1958.022,3.737
"from my understanding, on the record, that he did",1961.759,2.269
not meet with White House staff.,1964.028,2.469
"So, again, I think you&amp;#39;re trying to making something",1966.497,3.204
"that he -- is himself, from what I&amp;#39;ve read, not",1969.701,2.802
actually been the case.,1972.503,1.202
The Press: That&amp;#39;s not what I asked you.,1973.705,0.467
I asked you about cooperation to have access,1974.172,1.735
"to a SCIF, which is something that has to be",1975.907,1.401
carried out with your -- Mr. Spicer: I understand.,1977.308,2.369
I will be glad to take a look at that and figure,1979.677,1.301
out whether or not that is an accurate,1980.978,1.569
statement or not.,1982.547,1.067
The Press: Okay.,1983.614,0.468
Let me ask you about Jared.,1984.082,1.067
There is an understanding that&amp;#39;s trying to be worked,1985.149,3.07
"out, as we understand it, between Jared and",1988.219,1.969
the Senate Intelligence Committee.,1990.188,1.868
Is that a testimony?,1992.957,0.901
Is that something that the committee has requested?,1993.858,2.102
Has he volunteered?,1995.96,1.335
Does he believe he has something to explain to,1997.295,1.701
"that committee and, more broadly, the American",1998.996,2.036
public about what he did on behalf of the,2001.032,1.768
"transition with whom he met with, and some of the",2002.8,2.503
meetings that he took that are raising questions,2005.303,2.869
about Russia and folks that he met with that are,2008.172,3.17
outside of diplomatic channels but have other,2011.342,2.369
aspects to their Russian business deals that,2013.711,3.37
may cause some stir?,2017.081,1.869
"Mr. Spicer: So, throughout the campaign and the",2018.95,1.601
"transition, Jared served as the official primary",2020.551,3.571
point of contact with foreign governments and,2024.122,1.968
officials until we had State,2026.09,1.735
Department officials up.,2027.825,1.368
Once we assumed --,2029.193,1.602
The Press: (Inaudible) req uest?,2030.795,0.467
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s correct.,2031.262,0.567
"And so given this role, he volunteered to speak with",2031.829,3.771
"Chairman Burr&amp;#39;s committee, but has not received any",2035.6,2.536
confirmation regarding a time for a,2038.136,2.736
meeting or anything.,2040.872,1.067
The Press: And is this going to be a private,2041.939,0.968
"meeting, or is this going to be --",2042.907,0.801
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know.,2043.708,0.6
Again -- The Press: What is he trying to,2044.308,1.902
accomplish with that?,2046.21,1.135
Mr. Spicer: I think based on the questions that,2047.345,2.202
"surround this, he volunteered to go in and",2049.547,1.768
"sit down with them and say, hey, I&amp;#39;m glad to talk",2051.315,1.669
about the role that I played and the individuals,2052.984,2.369
I met with.,2055.353,0.667
"But again, remember, given the role that he played",2056.02,2.002
"both during the campaign and during the transition,",2058.022,2.403
he met with countless individuals.,2060.425,2.702
That was part of his job.,2063.127,1.235
That was part of his role.,2064.362,2.102
And he executed it completely as he was,2066.464,2.502
supposed to.,2068.966,0.668
The Press: And so he doesn&amp;#39;t believe he owes,2069.634,2.369
the American public an explanation?,2072.003,1.334
Mr. Spicer: For what?,2073.337,0.668
Doing his job?,2074.005,0.667
The Press: I&amp;#39;m just asking.,2074.672,0.934
Mr. Spicer: But you&amp;#39;re acting as though there&amp;#39;s,2075.606,1.335
something nefarious about doing what he was,2076.941,1.535
actually tasked to do.,2078.476,2.035
"The Press: Well, it&amp;#39;s not every day that someone in",2080.511,1.001
a senior position like Jared&amp;#39;s volunteers to go,2081.512,1.635
talk to the Senate Intelligence Committee,2083.147,1.402
about an investigation dealing with meddling by a,2084.549,2.469
foreign power in an American election.,2087.018,3.069
Mr. Spicer: And I think based on the media frenzy,2090.087,0.534
"around this, he --",2090.621,0.668
The Press: I&amp;#39;m just asking.,2091.289,0.634
Mr. Spicer: And I&amp;#39;m answering it.,2091.923,1.801
And I&amp;#39;m just saying to you that based on the media,2093.724,1.969
"frenzy that existed around this, he volunteered to",2095.693,2.636
"make sure that they -- he said, hey, we&amp;#39;ve made some",2098.329,2.102
"contacts, I&amp;#39;d be glad to explain them, let me know",2100.431,2.302
if you&amp;#39;d like to talk.,2102.733,1.469
Plain and simple.,2104.202,0.667
"The Press: Just to be clear, just to kind of",2104.869,3.47
follow up on what everyone has been asking about,2108.339,3.203
Chairman Nunes -- so the White House does not --,2111.542,2.069
does the White House have knowledge of the,2113.611,2.302
information that Chairman Nunes received when he,2115.913,3.404
came to the White House the first time?,2119.317,0.834
"And if that&amp;#39;s the case, or if that&amp;#39;s not the case, is",2120.151,5.105
your position that the White House is not going,2125.256,3.67
to look into where he got the information from or,2128.926,2.736
who gave him the information until his,2131.662,3.537
investigation is complete?,2135.199,0.668
Mr. Spicer: I think that -- I&amp;#39;m not aware of where,2135.867,1.301
he got it from.,2137.168,1.234
I know in his public statements he&amp;#39;s talked,2138.402,1.569
about having multiple sources.,2139.971,1.868
And so I don&amp;#39;t know how he derived the,2141.839,1.935
conclusion that he did.,2143.774,3.938
"And I think that at this point, the goal would be to",2147.712,1.401
wait until the review that he is undertaking,2149.113,3.637
is completed.,2152.75,1.769
Kaitlan.,2154.519,1.134
The Press: Why would Nunes need to brief the,2155.653,1.368
President on documents he viewed on,2157.021,1.969
White House grounds?,2158.99,1.067
Mr. Spicer: Because that&amp;#39;s a big assumption that,2160.057,1.001
you&amp;#39;re making that that&amp;#39;s the only thing.,2161.058,2.236
"As I said just a second ago, he had multiple",2163.294,2.936
sources on multiple topics.,2166.23,2.036
We don&amp;#39;t know what he briefed him on,2168.266,1.701
in its totality.,2169.967,0.768
"And so to jump to that conclusion is, frankly,",2170.735,2.969
irresponsible.,2173.704,1.202
The Press: One more question.,2174.906,0.734
When will the White House,2175.64,0.767
resume releasing visitor logs?,2176.407,2.469
Mr. Spicer: We&amp;#39;re reviewing that now.,2178.876,1.001
Alexis.,2179.877,1.835
The Press: Just to follow up -- I,2181.712,1.402
have two questions.,2183.114,0.6
One is on taxes.,2183.714,0.935
But last week you were advising the press corps,2184.649,3.637
that it didn&amp;#39;t make sense for Nunes to come to the,2188.286,2.902
White House to brief the President on something,2191.188,2.169
"that he had obtained from the White House,",2193.357,2.269
from the administration.,2195.626,1.635
So my question to you is -- I know what you just,2197.261,2.069
"said, but can you say factually, absolutely",2199.33,5.138
"flatly, that it is not possible that Chairman",2204.468,2.736
Nunes came to brief the President on something,2207.204,2.703
that he obtained from the White House,2209.907,2.236
or the administration?,2212.143,1.601
Mr. Spicer: I can&amp;#39;t say 100 percent that I know,2213.744,2.536
anything what he briefed him on.,2216.28,1.435
What I can tell you through his public,2217.715,1.702
comments is that he has said that he had multiple,2219.417,2.969
sources that he came to a conclusion on.,2222.386,2.002
So to the degree to which any of those sources,2224.388,3.003
weighed on the ultimate outcome of what he came to,2227.391,2.77
"a decision on, I don&amp;#39;t know.",2230.161,1.802
"And that&amp;#39;s something that, frankly, I don&amp;#39;t even know",2231.963,2.135
that he discussed with the President.,2234.098,1.802
The Press: So it&amp;#39;s possible?,2235.9,0.801
"As far as you know right now, it&amp;#39;s possible?",2236.701,1.401
Mr. Spicer: Anything is possible.,2238.102,0.934
The Press: Okay.,2239.036,0.668
Here&amp;#39;s my question on taxes.,2239.704,2.502
The President has said in the past that he thought,2242.206,2.569
maybe tax reform would flow over into 2018 --,2244.775,3.871
calendar year 2018.,2248.646,2.035
And we know from the President&amp;#39;s admiration of,2250.681,2.703
"the 1986 tax reform, that took more than two years.",2253.384,3.303
Can you answer two questions about,2256.687,1.602
tax reform?,2258.289,0.801
Does the President anticipate that it will,2259.09,1.568
"take that long, going into 2018 or beyond?",2260.658,3.603
And who is going to write the tax legislation?,2264.261,2.236
Who is going to devise the plan that the President,2266.497,2.236
wants to put his name on?,2268.733,2.535
"Mr. Spicer: Well, so on the first one, I know that",2271.268,1.268
Secretary Mnuchin has talked about August,2272.536,1.702
as a target date.,2274.238,1.468
And I think it depends.,2275.706,1.468
"I mean, as you point out, these are big things.",2277.174,3.137
There&amp;#39;s a lot of groups that are going to want a,2280.311,1.768
ton of input because of the very nature that,2282.079,2.803
it&amp;#39;s been 30 years.,2284.882,2.202
But I think part of this is going to be dependent,2287.084,1.835
on whether -- the degree to which we can come to,2288.919,4.371
consensus on a lot of big issues.,2293.29,3.07
But I know that we have a goal and it will depend on,2296.36,3.671
"a lot of these issues, both on the corporate side",2300.031,2.502
"and on the individual side, how that",2302.533,2.903
process evolves.,2305.436,0.701
So to predict it -- I know the Secretary would,2306.137,2.369
like to have it done.,2308.506,0.667
He&amp;#39;ll play a huge role in this.,2309.173,1.869
Gary Cohn will play a big role in it.,2311.042,1.534
I think our legislative affairs team will play,2312.576,1.602
a role in it.,2314.178,0.968
There&amp;#39;s a lot of folks on the team -- Secretary Ross,2315.146,2.636
on the Commerce side.,2317.782,1.368
There&amp;#39;s a lot of individuals -- he&amp;#39;s,2319.15,2.102
assembled a world-class Cabinet that has a lot of,2321.252,3.303
interest in helping to grow the economy to,2324.555,3.203
"attract jobs, create a more favorable tax climate",2327.758,2.236
"here in the country, but also provide tax relief",2329.994,2.369
for middle-class Americans.,2332.363,1.668
So we&amp;#39;re not there yet.,2334.031,3.07
The Press: So will it would be the Trump plan?,2337.101,1.602
Mr. Spicer: What?,2338.703,0.8
The Press: Will it be the President&amp;#39;s plan?,2339.503,1.769
"Mr. Spicer: I mean, obviously we&amp;#39;re driving",2341.272,0.967
the train on this.,2342.239,0.935
"So, I mean, we&amp;#39;re going to work with",2343.174,2.569
Congress on this.,2345.743,0.667
"But I think the President, as you&amp;#39;ve heard multiple",2346.41,4.838
times the President be very clear -- this is a,2351.248,1.368
huge priority for him and something that he feels,2352.616,2.47
very passionately about.,2355.086,1.368
And so we&amp;#39;ll have more on that later.,2356.454,2.102
John.,2358.556,1.134
"The Press: Sean, the documents that Chairman",2359.69,2.002
Nunes saw here at the White House complex are,2361.692,2.236
described by his office as being executive,2363.928,2.569
branch documents.,2366.497,1.201
In the early days after the President sent out,2367.698,1.902
"that tweet, the White House was digging around",2369.6,1.969
for anything to corroborate what the,2371.569,1.935
President had tweeted out.,2373.504,1.768
Why did it take the Intelligence Committee,2375.272,2.336
Chairman coming here to the White House to view,2377.608,2.736
executive branch documents to uncover,2380.344,1.769
this information?,2382.113,1.167
Why couldn&amp;#39;t the White House?,2383.28,0.634
"Mr. Spicer: Well, as I mentioned I think to",2383.914,3.537
"Margaret, I&amp;#39;m not going to -- I will stick to what",2387.451,1.869
the Chairman has said publicly.,2389.32,1.301
And my understanding from his public comments are,2390.621,2.503
that there are certain systems that he doesn&amp;#39;t,2393.124,1.735
have access to.,2394.859,1.902
"That was his explanation, and I&amp;#39;m going to -- I",2396.761,1.935
think you should follow up with him on that.,2398.696,1.668
The Press: Did the White House ever search the same,2400.364,1.468
documents that the Chairman searched?,2401.832,1.602
"Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know what he found, so",2403.434,1.134
therefore it would be hard to say -- to make an,2404.568,2.536
assessment of what he was briefed on or,2407.104,1.969
what we know.,2409.073,0.667
So that&amp;#39;s a really hard question to answer,2409.74,2.936
at this point.,2412.676,0.501
The Press: Is it possible that these documents were,2413.177,1.134
merely surveillance reports that were --,2414.311,3.737
"Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to get into hypotheticals,",2418.048,1.268
John.,2419.316,0.501
I don&amp;#39;t know what he found.,2419.817,0.934
"And to start to say what&amp;#39;s possible, what&amp;#39;s not,",2420.751,1.969
I don&amp;#39;t know.,2422.72,0.967
"The Press: Well, let me just finish, if I could.",2423.687,1.435
Is it possible that these were surveillance reports,2425.122,2.069
from security clearances that were collected after,2427.191,2.736
people had filled out Standard Form 86?,2429.927,0.968
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know.,2430.895,2.836
I don&amp;#39;t know what he -- I honestly don&amp;#39;t know what,2433.731,2.803
he&amp;#39;s got on his systems and what the intel,2436.534,3.737
community has on theirs that he wouldn&amp;#39;t,2440.271,3.904
have access to.,2444.175,1.134
So I don&amp;#39;t know what he would have had,2445.309,1.735
access to already.,2447.044,0.434
Eamon.,2447.478,0.3
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",2447.778,0.634
"On tax cuts, it looks like you guys got a little bit",2448.746,0.567
of political cover from the House Freedom Caucus,2449.613,0.601
over the weekend to do this without paying for,2450.681,1.869
"all of it -- that is, adding to the deficit.",2452.817,2.335
What&amp;#39;s the right number from the White House&amp;#39;s,2455.586,2.169
perspective to add to the deficit in order,2457.755,1.535
to do tax cuts?,2459.29,0.934
How high are you willing to go in terms of deficit?,2460.224,2.936
Mr. Spicer: It&amp;#39;s a really early question to be,2463.16,2.703
asking at this point.,2465.863,0.834
"I think the question is, as we construct this both",2466.697,3.27
on the corporate side and then on the individual,2469.967,3.07
"side, I think part of it is it&amp;#39;s going to be an",2473.037,2.369
"equation that isn&amp;#39;t just driven by that, but more",2475.406,2.736
"what&amp;#39;s going to attract jobs, what&amp;#39;s going to help",2478.142,1.702
"us build, what&amp;#39;s going to grow the economy.",2479.844,3.103
"I think we&amp;#39;re growing around -- potentially,",2482.947,2.202
"growing around 2.6, and the President really would",2485.149,3.17
like to see that growth right up in the high,2488.319,1.201
"3s, 4s, and 5s.",2489.52,3.27
And so there&amp;#39;s a question about what part of tax,2492.79,1.334
"reform, especially on the corporate side, will help",2494.525,3.103
us spur the economy and grow jobs.,2497.628,2.97
And I think that&amp;#39;s an ongoing discussion.,2500.598,3.803
I think that&amp;#39;s more of the driver of this.,2504.401,2.837
And then I think as it evolves we&amp;#39;ll have the,2507.238,0.734
score and we&amp;#39;ll know more.,2507.972,0.567
The Press: Are you comfortable entirely,2508.539,0.901
adding to the deficit?,2509.44,0.634
"Or do you think something needs to be offset, maybe",2510.074,1.268
some other spending cuts somewhere else?,2511.342,2.369
Mr. Spicer: You&amp;#39;re asking really early in the,2514.178,1.101
process to make that kind of analysis before we have,2515.646,2.736
a policy set forth or have any kind of notion of what,2518.949,2.77
a score would look like.,2522.019,0.734
Olivier.,2522.753,0.567
"Mr. Spicer: Thanks, Sean.",2523.32,0.668
There&amp;#39;s been an escalation of the American role in,2523.988,2.435
the war against the Islamic State.,2526.423,1.936
You&amp;#39;ve seen Marines come ashore in Syria.,2528.359,1.968
There have been changes to rules of engagement.,2530.327,1.802
I&amp;#39;m trying to understand the relationship between,2532.129,1.702
that change and the President&amp;#39;s,2533.831,1.034
ISIS strategy review.,2534.865,1.935
Has he personally signed off on all the changes in,2536.8,2.036
America&amp;#39;s posture in the field since January 20th?,2538.836,4.471
Is that something that&amp;#39;s left up to the,2543.307,1.368
commanders in the field?,2544.675,1.268
I don&amp;#39;t understand the relationship between --,2545.943,0.968
"Mr. Spicer: Well, it depends on which mission",2546.911,2.769
"you&amp;#39;re talking about, specifically, or -- The",2549.68,1.468
"Press: Marines left in, I think, October.",2551.148,1.735
They obviously went ashore much more,2552.883,1.635
recently than that.,2554.518,2.102
So did he have to sign off on that?,2556.62,1.835
"Mr. Spicer: I think it depends on -- I mean, he",2558.455,1.702
"speaks with General Mattis, his national",2560.157,2.703
security team very regularly.,2562.86,1.902
I&amp;#39;m not going to get into some of the details of,2564.762,1.735
what comes up in those settings.,2566.497,1.968
"But I will say that, as I&amp;#39;ve noted in the past, I",2568.465,2.403
think philosophically the President has made it very,2570.868,2.402
clear that he wants to give the commanders on the,2573.27,3.103
ground much more flexibility to execute,2576.373,1.669
"their mission, especially when it comes",2578.342,1.201
to defeating ISIS.,2579.944,0.567
"That&amp;#39;s a very big change in philosophy, but I think",2580.911,2.002
"it also depends on the magnitude of the mission,",2583.18,3.036
the number of ground troops in particular.,2586.216,1.202
And so this is an ongoing discussion that he has,2587.985,3.403
"with Secretary Mattis, Chairman Dunford and others.",2591.722,2.402
"The Press: So, on the review, are you waiting --",2594.925,2.736
is the President waiting until the review is,2599.43,0.967
complete before you announce sort of a new,2601.031,1.502
posture and new strategy?,2603.033,0.701
Or is it as conclusions come in you&amp;#39;re,2604.101,1.802
adapting day to day?,2606.503,0.935
Mr. Spicer: I think some of it is an ongoing,2607.905,3.17
discussion that he&amp;#39;s having with both Chairman,2611.942,2.703
Dunford of the Joint Chiefs and Secretary,2614.645,1.168
Mattis of DOD.,2615.813,0.567
At certain times when they meet they&amp;#39;ll update him on,2616.38,1.935
certain things and give him an update on where,2618.315,3.203
they&amp;#39;re headed right now.,2621.518,1.969
"As the review is ongoing, there&amp;#39;s certain events",2623.487,3.003
that are part of -- will be part and parcel of the,2626.49,3.303
"review in terms of where we&amp;#39;re going, and so",2630.361,1.501
they&amp;#39;ll update him on that and talk to him,2632.262,1.235
about the tweaks.,2633.497,0.634
Gabi.,2634.131,0.667
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",2634.798,0.668
President Trump has sent out two tweets now,2635.933,1.902
criticizing members of the House Freedom Caucus for,2638.402,1.768
preventing Planned Parenthood from being,2640.671,2.402
defunded by opposing the AHCA.,2643.44,2.97
Is that something that he would want to see tacked,2646.41,2.836
on as a rider to next month&amp;#39;s spending bill?,2649.246,2.202
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think that he&amp;#39;s made very clear",2651.448,4.204
"what his position is on Planned Parenthood, and",2655.652,3.371
obviously this was an opportunity to defund it.,2659.023,2.802
But I don&amp;#39;t want to get ahead of our,2661.825,4.572
legislative strategy.,2666.397,0.934
We&amp;#39;ll look at other opportunities.,2667.331,2.502
But this is definitely one that was a way to,2669.833,2.836
make that happen.,2672.669,0.601
Steve.,2673.27,0.701
The Press: On that legislative strategy and,2673.971,2.402
"the idea of working with Democrats, there&amp;#39;s a",2676.373,0.934
school of thought in this town that last week proved,2677.307,2.369
that the President is lacking in,2679.676,2.103
political capital.,2681.779,0.934
So I have two questions.,2682.713,1.068
"One is, what&amp;#39;s in it for Democrats to work with",2683.781,2.802
the President now?,2686.583,1.335
"And two, if fully pursued and to get things through",2687.918,3.303
"the House, Democrats and Republicans work together,",2691.221,4.138
wouldn&amp;#39;t that tend to undermine the job security,2695.359,1.635
of Speaker Ryan if the House Freedom Caucus,2696.994,1.902
is frozen out?,2698.896,1.801
"Mr. Spicer: Well, so two things.",2700.697,0.968
"Number one, I think the message that sends to the",2701.665,2.202
"American -- as I mentioned to, I think it was",2704.134,2.67
"Jonathan, at the beginning, it&amp;#39;s a",2707.071,0.867
two-way street.,2708.172,0.967
We heard -- when you see whether it&amp;#39;s Judge,2709.139,2.102
"Gorsuch, which they&amp;#39;re throwing down decades of",2711.508,2.403
Senate tradition by saying we&amp;#39;re just going to,2714.378,2.035
filibuster this guy -- I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s anyone,2716.847,2.169
in America that can honestly look at his,2719.249,1.769
qualifications and suggest that he&amp;#39;s not qualified as,2721.018,3.837
a jurist on the Supreme Court.,2724.855,1.368
"I mean, there&amp;#39;s nothing that anyone has seen or",2726.223,2.502
laid a glove on him through these four days,2728.725,1.902
that suggests that he&amp;#39;s not qualified to serve.,2730.627,3.537
"And I think that it&amp;#39;s a -- and again, with Obamacare,",2734.164,3.871
"repealing and replacing it, several of the leading",2738.035,2.402
"Democrats came out from the get-go and said, we",2740.437,1.769
have no interest in doing that.,2742.206,1.368
So I think there&amp;#39;s a point at which both parties can,2743.574,2.969
look back and figure out whether or not,2746.543,1.735
it&amp;#39;s worth engaging.,2748.278,1.168
"I think the President, as I mentioned, is eager to",2749.446,3.27
"get to 218 on a lot of his initiatives, whether it&amp;#39;s",2752.716,3.604
"tax reform, infrastructure.",2756.954,2.002
There are a lot of things.,2758.956,1.635
And I think that he is going to be willing to,2760.591,0.4
listen to other voices on the other side to figure,2762.192,3.604
out if people want to work with him to get these big,2766.13,1.768
"things done, to make Washington work, to",2768.198,2.436
"enhance the lives of the American people, then he&amp;#39;s",2771.368,1.368
going to work with them.,2773.003,1.068
I think he had a great meeting with the CBC the,2774.071,1.835
"other day, for example, where he talked",2775.906,1.268
about infrastructure.,2777.174,1.702
"He talked about loans and small business lending,",2778.876,3.536
education.,2782.412,1.335
There are things that he is willing to engage,2783.747,3.437
individuals with -- or groups or caucuses -- to,2787.184,3.07
get to 218 and further advance his agenda.,2790.254,5.338
So it&amp;#39;s not about undermining anybody.,2795.592,2.369
It&amp;#39;s about moving the agenda forward and,2797.961,2.203
getting things done.,2800.164,1.001
The Press: It&amp;#39;s Speaker Ryan who puts bills on the,2801.165,2.202
"floor, not the President.",2803.367,1.134
So what&amp;#39;s in it for Speaker Ryan?,2804.501,1.402
Mr. Spicer: Getting things done.,2805.903,0.9
I think there is still a sense of doing what&amp;#39;s in,2806.803,1.769
the best interest of this country that exists.,2808.572,2.636
"So I mean, let&amp;#39;s just make sure that we understand --",2811.208,2.602
I think that his goal -- he came here to,2813.81,1.869
get things done.,2815.679,1.235
"And I think as was pointed out, there was a level of",2816.914,3.236
disappointment that he expressed on Friday.,2820.15,1.969
He wants to get things done.,2822.119,1.535
If people want to work together -- and I think,2823.654,0.901
"what this event on Friday did was, frankly, draw",2824.555,2.502
"more people into the process, to saying, okay,",2827.491,2.769
let&amp;#39;s figure out if we can actually come together,2830.26,1.435
"with some consensus ideas to get to 218, whether or",2832.095,2.47
not they come from one side of the aisle or the,2835.265,1.468
"other, to pass this bill and make a better system.",2837.1,2.77
"He understands -- and frankly, I think a lot of",2840.37,1.769
Democrats do -- that there&amp;#39;s an opportunity here.,2842.139,1.268
"With healthcare being such a big issue, with",2844.041,1.935
"Obamacare being such a looming disaster, that we",2847.277,4.138
have an opportunity to do some stuff.,2851.415,1.601
"And if Democrats want to join in, then that&amp;#39;s",2853.016,1.368
great and we&amp;#39;ll do that.,2854.384,0.968
Mike.,2855.352,0.434
The Press: You&amp;#39;ve talked quite a bit up there about,2855.786,4.137
the wide latitude that Secretary Price has to,2859.923,2.403
dismantle Obamacare from this spot.,2862.326,3.303
Is that still the case?,2865.629,1.234
Will he continue to try to dismantle Obamacare while,2866.863,2.603
you&amp;#39;re trying to work with moderate Democrats,2869.466,2.669
on healthcare reform?,2872.135,1.569
"And also, the healthcare bill would have repealed",2873.704,4.004
almost all those Obamacare taxes.,2877.708,1.935
Do you want to see those repealed as part of the,2879.643,2.569
tax reform bill?,2882.212,1.301
Mr. Spicer: I think Secretary Price,2883.513,1.235
is up here today.,2884.748,0.934
There&amp;#39;s a lot of meetings that are already taking,2885.682,2.269
place internally with the team.,2887.951,1.802
There&amp;#39;s a lot of options that are on the table in,2889.753,2.135
terms of -- especially when it comes to what we,2891.888,1.969
"call phase one and phase two, trying to get some of",2893.857,2.636
that stuff out the door.,2896.493,1.001
And as we look back on -- talking about lessons,2897.494,3.604
"learned, I think one of them is to try to get some",2901.098,1.801
of the phase one and phase two meshed together,2902.899,2.47
and pushed out.,2905.369,0.901
"How we do that, whether we wait for the revival of",2906.27,3.47
"legislation before we put it up -- remember, I think",2909.74,2.903
"-- just so we&amp;#39;re clear, and I mentioned earlier on",2912.643,3.069
this -- Obamacare had a ton of fits and starts,2915.712,2.937
during its process.,2918.649,1.434
"It was left for dead multiple times, but",2920.083,2.603
they pressed forward.,2922.686,1.835
I don&amp;#39;t think that that&amp;#39;s necessarily a model to,2924.521,0.634
"look for in terms of how they jammed it down, but I",2925.155,2.836
"do think that we have to recognize that we were 17,",2927.991,3.537
18 days into this process.,2931.528,1.468
I think the President has made very clear it&amp;#39;s not,2932.996,3.137
"over, there are people coming to the table, but",2936.133,1.835
he&amp;#39;s going to listen to all good ideas across the,2937.968,1.702
spectrum to figure out what it takes,2939.67,1.568
to get to 218.,2941.238,1.468
And we&amp;#39;ll see where we go from there.,2942.706,1.201
John.,2943.907,1.335
"The Press: The tax question, to follow up on",2945.242,1.601
the -- the healthcare bill would have repealed those,2946.843,2.937
Obamacare taxes?,2949.78,0.901
Mr. Spicer: And I think that&amp;#39;s part and parcel of,2950.681,1.635
"that discussion, is how we look at both the taxes",2952.316,3.203
and some of the phase one stuff.,2955.519,1.401
But we&amp;#39;re not ready to announce anything now.,2956.92,2.202
Jon Decker.,2959.122,0.935
"The Press: Yeah, as far as Jared Kushner&amp;#39;s offer to",2960.057,2.269
meet with Chairman Burr and talk with the Senate,2962.326,4.204
"Intelligence Committee, is there any particular",2966.53,3.37
reason why the White House would not be opposed to,2969.9,2.769
"the idea of Jared Kushner testifying, under oath,",2972.669,3.637
before that committee?,2976.306,1.301
"Mr. Spicer: Again, Jared volunteered to meet",2977.607,0.501
with the committee.,2978.108,3.604
They haven&amp;#39;t even confirmed having a meeting,2981.712,2.235
"yet, so to get ahead of what they&amp;#39;ve even asked",2983.947,2.002
for would be a little silly.,2985.949,1.335
"The Press: But does it set, in the White House&amp;#39;s",2987.284,2.002
"view, a dangerous precedent in having a",2989.286,2.869
senior aide to the President going up?,2992.155,2.469
"Ordinarily, we see, sometimes, the White House",2994.624,2.336
invoking executive privilege.,2996.96,2.503
Why haven&amp;#39;t you done this in this particular case?,2999.463,2.369
Mr. Spicer: Because I think Jared did a job,3001.832,1.935
during the transition in the campaign where he was,3003.767,3.57
"a conduit to leaders, and that&amp;#39;s until we had a",3007.337,5.005
State Department -- a functioning place for,3012.342,3.037
people to go.,3015.379,1.234
"Remember, we had a delay in some of these things,",3016.613,3.237
and that was his role.,3019.85,0.8
And he wants to make sure that he&amp;#39;s very clear about,3020.65,1.702
"the role that he played, who he talked to,",3022.352,0.901
and that&amp;#39;s it.,3023.253,2.87
Jim.,3026.123,0.8
The Press: Is Obamacare repeal dead?,3026.923,2.837
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s dead in the sense --,3029.76,3.103
The Press: Or it would have to be dead if you&amp;#39;re,3032.863,1.268
going to have Democrats working with you to,3034.131,1.101
address the Affordable Care Act.,3035.232,0.867
Mr. Spicer: Why?,3036.099,0.534
"No, no, no, I don&amp;#39;t know that that&amp;#39;s true because",3036.633,0.934
I think it&amp;#39;s --,3037.567,0.668
The Press: Why would they work with you if --,3038.235,0.8
Mr. Spicer: Because it&amp;#39;s dying.,3039.035,0.768
"Mr. Spicer: Because I think part of it is, is",3039.803,2.736
there&amp;#39;s a recognition that it is failing.,3042.539,1.768
It&amp;#39;s dying on its own.,3044.307,0.801
It will be dead soon.,3045.108,2.303
The Press: A lot of Democrats say,3047.411,0.734
it&amp;#39;s not dying.,3048.145,0.5
"Mr. Spicer: Okay, well, then a lot of Democrats",3048.645,1.034
"need to get more money, because -- The Press:",3049.679,1.268
"There are repairs that need to be made, they say,",3050.947,2.102
but to kill the whole thing might not be the,3053.049,2.069
route they want to go.,3055.118,0.801
"Mr. Spicer: I understand what they want, but I",3055.919,1.134
think there&amp;#39;s a difference.,3057.053,0.568
I think that we recognize that premiums continue to,3057.621,2.803
"go sky-high, deductibles are going sky-high,",3060.424,2.535
choices are going down.,3062.959,1.502
"By Leader Pelosi&amp;#39;s own metric, this is dying.",3064.461,2.569
She&amp;#39;s the one who crafted the metric.,3067.03,4.238
She said that there was a three-pronged system to,3071.268,2.469
determining its success.,3073.737,1.001
It is an abysmal failure.,3074.738,1.735
If they want to come back to the table and recognize,3076.473,3.337
how we can do it in a more responsible way to achieve,3079.81,3.236
the goals that Obamacare set out to do -- but do so,3083.046,2.503
in a way that is going to do the opposite of what,3085.549,2.802
"Obamacare actually did, which is to increase",3088.351,2.77
"choice, drive down cost -- we&amp;#39;re willing to",3091.121,2.402
have that discussion.,3093.523,0.935
But right now --,3094.458,0.834
The Press: They say repeal has to be put to the side.,3095.292,1.368
Mr. Spicer: Right.,3096.66,1.401
"But, Jim, one of the things that I mentioned --",3098.061,2.636
I just want to be clear on this -- is we have to,3100.697,1.568
"figure out how we get to 216, 218, depending on",3102.265,1.835
where the number is that given day.,3104.1,1.502
That doesn&amp;#39;t mean we need the entire,3105.602,2.302
Democratic Caucus.,3107.904,0.634
That means we need some responsible Democrats who,3108.538,1.502
want to sit down and have a discussion about,3110.04,1.635
how to do that.,3111.675,0.901
And I think that there may be enough of them that are,3112.576,1.334
"willing to do that, but I understand where the",3113.91,1.769
"Democratic leadership is, and that&amp;#39;s one thing.",3115.679,5.739
"I mean, they continue to stake out a very,",3121.418,1.802
very far-left position.,3123.22,1.501
That&amp;#39;s not where all their members are.,3124.721,1.802
And I think that we can -- based on the calls that,3126.523,2.235
"have come in over the last 50, 60 hours, I think that",3128.758,3.304
there might be some room to have a conversation,3132.062,2.736
with people who want to engage in a constructive,3134.798,1.868
conversation on how to move forward.,3136.666,2.837
So let&amp;#39;s see how that evolves.,3139.503,1.668
I don&amp;#39;t know that we&amp;#39;re ready to jump into this,3141.171,1.868
"today, but I think as the calls come forward, the",3143.039,1.936
"President&amp;#39;s view is, if you all want to get",3144.975,2.369
together and start coming to a way that we can come,3147.344,1.535
"to resolution, we&amp;#39;re willing to listen.",3148.879,3.003
"But right now, we&amp;#39;ve got an agenda to",3151.882,1.901
continue to pursue.,3153.783,1.135
The Press: There might be a middle ground,3154.918,0.767
there you think?,3155.685,1.068
"Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to jump ahead, but I will",3156.753,2.302
say that we believe that there is something that,3159.055,2.169
"could still be done at some point, and I think",3161.224,1.869
"the further along we go, where premiums continue to",3163.093,4.237
"go up, more and more people will be drawn into",3167.33,2.57
this discussion because there is going to be a,3169.9,1.635
continued cry from people in terms of the impact,3171.535,3.703
that it&amp;#39;s having on their pocketbook and on their,3175.238,2.703
ability to see people that -- a doctor of their,3177.941,3.303
choice or a plan that&amp;#39;s just not,3181.244,1.568
seeing them anymore.,3182.812,1.168
The Press: A real quick follow-up on,3183.98,1.835
Chairman Nunes.,3185.815,0.835
Do you reject that there is any kind of perception,3186.65,2.535
problem whatsoever in having the Chairman over,3189.185,2.069
here the day before he comes out publicly and,3191.254,3.103
"says, by the way, there&amp;#39;s this information that&amp;#39;s",3194.357,2.036
helpful to the President?,3196.393,0.934
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think the Chairman has made very",3197.327,1.668
clear through his public comments what his goal,3198.995,1.902
"was, and I think anyone who wants to -- I mean,",3200.897,1.502
you can&amp;#39;t ask someone to do a review of the,3202.399,2.536
"situation, and then sort of create inferences",3204.935,5.572
because they&amp;#39;re reviewing a situation that there&amp;#39;s,3210.507,2.302
something that&amp;#39;s not right about that.,3212.809,2.736
He is reviewing a situation.,3215.545,1.769
He did exactly -- and I think he&amp;#39;s been fairly,3217.314,2.002
"open with the press as far as what he was doing, who",3219.316,2.469
"he spoke to, and why.",3221.785,1.268
"And I think, you know, from our standpoint,",3223.053,3.069
"that&amp;#39;s what we had asked to do, is a review.",3226.122,2.036
April.,3228.158,0.734
"The Press: Sean, several topics. One --",3228.892,2.002
Mr. Spicer: Shocker.,3230.894,2.002
(Laughter.),3232.896,1.768
The Press: Don&amp;#39;t be.,3234.664,0.768
You heard the question that I lobbed at the,3235.432,3.537
Attorney General about the hate crime that happened,3238.969,1.835
in New York -- the white supremacist who went to,3240.804,4.771
New York and targeted a black man.,3245.575,2.169
Hate crimes are on the rise.,3247.744,1.768
What do you say?,3249.512,1.502
What is this White House saying about this obvious,3251.014,2.502
apparent hate crime?,3253.516,2.036
"Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to -- I mean, you yelled",3255.552,1.768
"at the Attorney General a specific case, if I&amp;#39;m --",3257.32,3.804
The Press: The White House in the past had,3261.124,0.601
talked about this.,3261.725,0.6
And you talked about issues of hate crimes --,3262.325,2.002
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m glad to talk about the issues.,3264.327,1.135
I just want to be very clear that I am not going,3265.462,1.968
to reference any specific case before the,3267.43,1.602
DOJ right now.,3269.032,1.635
I will say that the President has recognized,3270.667,3.403
that we need to bring the country together.,3274.07,2.303
He wants to unite this country.,3276.373,1.968
He wants to bring people together.,3278.341,1.035
He had a very long conversation with respect,3279.376,2.002
"to race in itself, which I think is somewhat -- if",3281.378,3.77
I&amp;#39;m not correct in your question --,3285.148,1.335
The Press: (Inaudible.),3286.483,0.967
"Mr. Spicer: Okay, I just want to be clear.",3287.45,1.068
Thank you.,3288.518,0.934
And I think that was one of the topics that he,3289.452,1.135
talked about with the CBC.,3290.587,1.568
"Some of the issues, with respect to crime and",3292.155,3.136
"education, and some of the solutions that they",3295.291,3.27
suggested that could be done during their meeting.,3298.561,3.17
And I think those are the kind of things that I,3301.731,2.369
think we can continue that conversation.,3304.1,1.835
"The Press: Sean, unfortunately there has",3305.935,2.837
been a rise in hate crimes when it comes to different,3308.772,2.569
"groups, to include anti-Semitic crimes.",3311.341,3.236
You&amp;#39;ve commented from that podium -- this is clear --,3314.577,3.771
"this gentleman, in his jailhouse, gave a",3318.348,2.536
statement to a reporter talking about he wishes,3320.884,3.069
the man were younger and he was a thug that killed.,3323.953,4.071
So what do you say to this?,3328.024,1.735
This is clear -- it&amp;#39;s racism at its ugliest.,3329.759,2.703
Mr. Spicer: Two issues.,3332.462,1.368
"Number one, I think hate crimes, anti-Semitic",3333.83,3.537
crimes of any nature should be called out in,3337.367,3.937
the most reprehensible way.,3341.304,1.869
"There is no room for that in our country, and I",3343.173,2.936
"think the President noted that in the Joint Address,",3346.109,2.135
"that there is one issue that, despite policy,",3348.244,2.002
"should unite us -- and that is calling out hate,",3350.246,2.503
that is calling out divisiveness based on the,3352.749,2.169
"color of one&amp;#39;s skin, one&amp;#39;s religion, one&amp;#39;s gender.",3354.918,3.837
"The President has been very clear on that, and",3358.755,1.468
he&amp;#39;s called it out before.,3360.223,1.768
"With respect to certain particular situations, he",3361.991,2.036
made it very clear.,3364.027,0.967
"At the opening of his Joint Address, that&amp;#39;s what",3364.994,1.736
he led with -- is a call to denounce hate no matter,3366.73,4.571
where we come from politically.,3371.301,2.169
He&amp;#39;s also talked about it the night that he took the,3373.47,2.836
"stage on that Wednesday morning around 2:40 a.m.,",3376.306,3.804
about how one of the things that he needed to,3380.11,1.835
do and wanted to do as President was,3381.945,1.201
unite all Americans.,3383.146,1.068
"But I think that there&amp;#39;s one other piece to this,",3384.214,1.935
"April, that I just want to be clear on.",3386.149,1.401
While we unequivocally -- no question about it --,3387.55,3.037
"need to call out hate, anti-Semitism where it",3390.587,2.636
"exists, there is another thing that we have to do,",3393.223,2.302
"and, in your case in particular, while I don&amp;#39;t",3395.525,1.468
"know all of the details, and I don&amp;#39;t want to",3396.993,2.069
reference any specific case -- but I think we saw,3399.062,2.836
this the other day with some of the anti-Semitic,3401.898,2.002
behavior that was going out with respect to people,3403.9,2.87
"of the Jewish faith, is that we saw these threats",3406.77,3.269
"coming into Jewish community centers, and",3410.039,1.335
there was an immediate jump to criticize folks on,3411.374,2.936
the right and to denounce people on the right and,3414.31,2.903
ask them to condemn them.,3417.213,1.902
"And it turns out that, in fact, it wasn&amp;#39;t",3419.115,1.468
someone on the right.,3420.583,1.635
"And it was -- and the President, from the",3422.218,2.136
"get-go, had said, I bet you it&amp;#39;s not someone --",3424.354,2.102
and he was right. And yet --,3426.456,1.335
The Press: I&amp;#39;m not calling this --,3427.791,0.7
"Mr. Spicer: Hold on, I understand that.",3428.491,0.734
And that&amp;#39;s --,3429.225,0.534
The Press: -- saying he&amp;#39;s a white supremacist.,3429.759,0.834
Mr. Spicer: I understand that.,3430.593,0.634
"And I think, in those cases, there&amp;#39;s no question",3431.227,2.069
-- black and white -- we need to call out all,3433.296,1.935
instances of this.,3435.231,1.268
"That being said, while we&amp;#39;re on the topic, I do",3436.499,2.303
think that there has been a rush to judgement in a,3438.802,2.769
"lot of other cases when it comes to -- in particular,",3441.571,2.436
some of the anti-Semitic discussion -- where people,3444.007,2.135
have jumped to the conclusion about,3446.142,2.036
denouncing people on the right and asking for this.,3448.178,2.435
"And in that particular case, we saw that the",3450.613,2.603
President was right and that this rush to judgment,3453.216,2.469
"by a lot of folks on the left was wrong, and none",3455.685,2.503
of them have been held to account on that.,3458.188,2.135
And that is something that equally needs,3460.323,2.569
to be called out.,3462.892,0.434
When people are charging something of someone that,3463.326,1.201
"is not true, there has been nothing to go back to",3464.527,2.603
those individuals -- nothing -- on the left who,3467.13,2.703
came and asked for everyone on the right to,3469.833,1.901
denounce something that they weren&amp;#39;t guilty of.,3471.734,2.903
And I think that there needs to be an equal -- go,3474.637,2.436
back in time and call out those individuals for,3477.073,1.935
rushing to judgment and calling out,3479.008,2.236
those individuals.,3481.244,0.867
"The Press: And my second topic, and I&amp;#39;m done.",3482.111,1.135
Someone who was in the room -- you like talking,3483.246,3.47
about the CBC meeting that happened last week.,3486.716,2.202
"Someone who was actually in the room, at that",3488.918,2.603
"meeting, said that the issue of HBCUs came up --",3491.521,4.338
and that&amp;#39;s a very sensitive subject right,3495.859,1.735
now in the black community and here,3497.594,2.235
at the White House.,3499.829,1.068
"The issue of HBCUs came up, and Omarosa said that",3500.897,4.137
she would be the one heading the HBCU Office at,3505.034,4.772
"the White House, and the President did not make a",3509.806,2.502
response confirming or denying.,3512.308,2.336
Will this be the case?,3514.644,2.002
Is this the case?,3516.646,0.867
Mr. Spicer: We don&amp;#39;t have any announcements to make.,3517.513,1.602
I assume that you&amp;#39;re referring to the executive,3519.115,1.935
"order, and we don&amp;#39;t have anything to announce on",3521.05,2.536
that subject at this time.,3523.586,1.535
Kristen.,3525.121,1.201
"The Press: Sean, thank you.",3526.322,0.534
Given that the Freedom Caucus blocked the bill to,3526.856,3.237
"repeal and replace Obamacare, does the",3530.093,2.402
President still believe he can work with the Freedom,3532.495,2.936
Caucus on future pieces of legislation?,3535.431,3.504
Mr. Spicer: I think it&amp;#39;s going to depend on,3538.935,1.335
what legislation --,3540.27,1.301
The Press: So not necessarily?,3541.571,0.934
"Mr. Spicer: Well, again, I&amp;#39;m not going to -- it&amp;#39;s",3542.505,1.168
not a question of -- we&amp;#39;re going to work with anybody,3543.673,1.468
who wants to work with us on achieving the goals the,3545.141,4.805
President set out.,3549.946,0.901
"I don&amp;#39;t think -- we&amp;#39;re not putting anyone and saying,",3550.847,2.202
&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ll never work with you again.&amp;quot;,3553.049,1.869
It is that balance --,3554.918,0.767
The Press: Has he written them off?,3555.685,0.767
"Mr. Spicer: No, I don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;s written -- no,",3556.452,1.335
"I think, as he mentioned, he learned a lot through",3557.787,2.603
this process about loyalty.,3560.39,1.368
"And it&amp;#39;s not just a bloc, it&amp;#39;s certain individuals.",3561.758,2.469
"And again, I&amp;#39;m not going to get into naming names,",3564.227,2.936
but I think the President learned a lot,3567.163,1.168
through this process.,3568.331,1.234
"And one of the things that&amp;#39;s interesting is,",3569.565,2.737
when you look back -- and I know there&amp;#39;s been a lot,3572.302,3.603
to make of this -- the President also recognizes,3575.905,1.435
"when there&amp;#39;s not a deal to be made, when",3577.34,2.035
to walk away.,3579.375,0.834
That&amp;#39;s one of the traits -- it&amp;#39;s not just about,3580.209,3.003
"making deals, it&amp;#39;s knowing when to walk away from",3583.212,1.902
"deals, and knowing when there&amp;#39;s a bad deal that&amp;#39;s",3585.114,1.936
the only solution.,3587.05,1.101
And I think the President understood that while you,3588.151,2.769
"can get a deal at the time, that sometimes a bad",3590.92,4.938
deal is worse than getting a deal.,3595.858,1.836
And I think he smartly recognized that what was,3597.694,2.569
on the table was not going to be keeping with the,3600.263,1.835
"vision that he had, and so he decided that this was",3602.098,5.138
not the time and that a deal was not at hand.,3607.236,2.603
The Press: Let me ask you about this tweet,3609.839,1.502
over the weekend.,3611.341,1.101
Does he regret tweeting to his followers that they,3612.442,2.903
"should tune in to Judge Jeanine only to tune in,",3615.345,3.403
and then have her call for House Speaker Paul Ryan,3618.748,1.868
to step down?,3620.616,0.835
Mr. Spicer: He&amp;#39;s a fan of the show.,3621.451,0.734
"That&amp;#39;s it, plain and simple.",3622.185,0.801
I mean --,3622.986,0.4
The Press: But does he owe Speaker Ryan an apology then?,3623.386,0.767
Mr. Spicer: He and Speaker Ryan talked extensively,3624.153,1.902
over the weekend.,3626.055,1.001
The Press: Did they talk today?,3627.056,0.701
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know if they talked today.,3627.757,2.135
I think they talked both Saturday and,3629.892,1.302
Sunday at length.,3631.194,0.867
"But again, he is a fan of the show.",3632.061,2.636
He tweeted out support of it.,3634.697,1.101
"That&amp;#39;s it, plain and simple.",3635.798,1.101
The Press: A lot of people say it&amp;#39;s a lot more,3636.899,1.235
than coincidence.,3638.134,0.834
"Mr. Spicer: I know what a lot of people say,",3638.968,0.467
Kristen.,3639.435,0.334
I just said it.,3639.769,0.567
The Press: So does he owe the,3640.336,0.501
House Speaker an apology?,3640.837,0.467
Mr. Spicer: No.,3641.304,0.434
He doesn&amp;#39;t -- he has spoken -- for what?,3641.738,1.268
For supporting a show on Fox?,3643.006,1.034
No.,3644.04,0.5
Dave.,3644.54,0.801
The Press: And does he still have confidence they,3645.341,1.201
"can work together, Sean?",3646.542,0.301
Mr. Spicer: Dave.,3646.843,0.667
The Press: Two questions.,3647.51,0.567
One on the President choosing Jared Kushner for,3648.077,2.636
this new Office of American Innovation to,3650.713,2.369
reform government across the government.,3653.082,2.67
"Obviously, Jared Kushner has 60-some days of",3655.752,3.403
experience in Washington -- never had a prior,3659.155,2.069
government job.,3661.224,1.468
"Does the President view that, somehow, as an",3662.692,1.802
advantage in this case?,3664.494,1.301
"Mr. Spicer: In some cases, when you look at the",3665.795,1.668
individuals that he&amp;#39;s bringing in.,3667.463,1.802
"Again, I think one of the things that Jared -- and",3669.265,2.136
"again, they may talk more about this later -- but",3671.401,3.503
one of the things that Jared is looking at is,3674.904,2.002
some of the procurement -- the technology aspects.,3676.906,2.97
And if you&amp;#39;ve ever really dealt with the government,3679.876,2.402
and recognized how outdated and un-modernized,3682.278,3.103
"some of this is, it is not serving the American",3685.381,1.935
"people, it is not serving the constituents that many",3687.316,2.069
departments have.,3689.385,2.102
And I think looking at how we procure different,3691.487,3.671
things and procure technology in particular,3695.158,2.969
is important.,3698.127,0.868
"It&amp;#39;s an important way -- I mean, I think when you",3698.995,1.968
"look at the VA, in particular, and recognize",3700.963,2.703
how it handles certain things -- there are,3703.666,1.769
"certain things it does really well, by the way.",3705.435,1.735
It buys prescription drugs really well.,3707.17,1.701
It buys them in bulk -- gets the job done.,3708.871,2.436
But there&amp;#39;s certain things that it may not do as well,3711.307,3.337
in terms of how it keeps its records and how it,3714.644,1.968
"serves veterans, how it lends money, et cetera --",3716.612,2.77
that we can look at and figure out is,3719.382,2.536
there a better way.,3721.918,1.201
"Government is not business, right?",3723.119,2.169
We recognize that there are certain things that,3725.288,1.568
business would never do in terms of what government,3726.856,3.27
"has to do, because we serve all of our people.",3730.126,2.602
But there are certain practices that we can put,3732.728,2.403
"in place that can help us deliver a better product,",3735.131,2.769
a better service to the American people in some,3737.9,2.403
of these key areas.,3740.303,0.801
And I think that when you look at some of the,3741.104,2.302
business acumen that Jared and some of the other,3743.406,3.37
individuals who he is bringing into this process,3746.776,3.036
can really -- I think it is a great service,3749.812,2.803
to this country.,3752.615,0.801
There are so many individuals that Jared has,3753.416,2.502
talked that have done so well and been so blessed,3755.918,2.269
by our nation that have wanted to give back in,3758.187,2.102
"some way, shape, or form, and are using this",3760.289,2.136
opportunity to help our country and serve our,3762.425,2.402
country in ways that they believe they can use their,3764.827,4.538
expertise to do.,3769.365,1.168
"The Press: On healthcare, this review that you&amp;#39;ve",3770.533,3.37
"talked about -- what went right, what went wrong --",3773.903,1.735
"I know you don&amp;#39;t want to name names, but would it",3775.638,2.402
"be fair to say, at this point, that the President",3778.04,2.269
has written off some people?,3780.309,1.135
Mr. Spicer: I just -- I think I answered,3781.444,1.134
that question.,3782.578,0.668
"It&amp;#39;s not a question of written them off, it&amp;#39;s a",3783.246,1.868
question of understanding -- there&amp;#39;s sort of an,3785.114,1.602
understanding of how you deal with certain people,3786.716,4.504
and how they dealt with you.,3791.22,1.235
But it&amp;#39;s not a question of writing them off.,3792.455,1.334
"We&amp;#39;re going to need to get to -- as time goes on,",3793.789,3.537
"we&amp;#39;ll get to -- I&amp;#39;m just going to keep saying 218,",3797.326,1.802
it&amp;#39;s easier.,3799.128,1.068
I won&amp;#39;t screw that one up down the line.,3800.196,2.035
But I think that we recognize that as we go,3802.231,2.436
"down this path of a big, bold agenda that the",3804.667,2.936
"President has, that we&amp;#39;re going to need every vote",3807.603,2.403
"we can, and hopefully grow the vote in some cases to",3810.006,2.569
well beyond that.,3812.575,1.735
"But we&amp;#39;re not writing off anybody, but we do",3814.31,1.602
recognize there are some lessons learned form this,3815.912,3.737
"process, and the President made it very clear on",3819.649,1.401
Friday.,3821.05,0.567
"Thank you, guys, very much.",3821.617,0.668
I&amp;#39;ll see you tomorrow.,3822.285,1.668
Enjoy the day.,3823.953,0.534
