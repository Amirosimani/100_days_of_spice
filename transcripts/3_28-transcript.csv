"Mr. Spicer: I know the pool is gathering at 1:30 p.m.,",1.167,1.869
so I&amp;#39;m going to try and keep this on the short end.,3.036,2.369
"This morning, the President held a listening",5.405,1.501
session with the Attorney General and the Fraternal,6.906,1.969
Order of Police with the Vice President to discuss,8.875,2.035
law enforcement issues related to terrorism,10.91,2.503
and inner-city violence.,13.413,1.702
The Fraternal Order of Police is the world&amp;#39;s,15.115,1.968
largest organization of sworn law enforcement,17.083,2.736
"officers, with more than 330,000 members.",19.819,3.504
They represent those who dedicate their lives,23.323,2.602
to protecting and serving.,25.925,1.669
They advocate for improved working conditions for law,27.594,2.269
enforcement officers and for the safety of our communities.,29.863,3.003
The President thanked the FOP leadership for their,32.866,2.669
support and reaffirmed his pledge to have our back.,35.535,3.67
The President also remarked that his highest,39.205,1.835
duty is the security of our people and pointed to,41.04,2.603
several actions that he&amp;#39;s already taken to enhance,43.643,2.703
"our domestic security, including the creation of",46.346,2.769
a Task Force on Reducing Violent Crime;,49.115,2.836
an Inter-Agency Task Force to Dismantle Criminal,51.951,2.47
Cartels; and historic action to secure our,54.421,3.203
borders and remove criminals from our country.,57.624,1.802
The group held an in-depth discussion about the rise,59.426,2.936
"of violent crime in some parts of the country,",62.362,1.835
the disturbing increase in members of law enforcement,64.197,2.736
"being targeted in ambush style attacks,",66.933,2.569
and the need to address the country&amp;#39;s opioid epidemic.,69.502,4.571
Attorney General Sessions told the FOP leadership,74.073,2.169
that he looks forward to continuing to work closely,76.242,2.169
with them to tackle the challenges facing law,78.411,1.902
enforcement as they work to keep our communities safe.,80.313,3.27
"This afternoon, as I mentioned at the top,",83.583,1.702
the President will sign an executive order on energy,85.285,2.402
independence at the Environmental Protection,87.687,2.302
Agency Headquarters.,89.989,1.569
The President strongly believes that protecting,91.558,2.068
the environment and promoting our economy,93.626,2.169
are not mutually exclusive goals.,95.795,2.67
This executive order will help to ensure that we have,98.465,2.869
clean air and clean water without sacrificing,101.334,2.903
economic growth and job creation.,104.237,2.569
"First, it directs all agencies to conduct a",106.806,2.336
"review of all regulation, rules, policies,",109.142,3.07
and guidance documents that put up roadblocks to,112.212,2.902
domestic energy production and identify the ones that,115.114,3.104
are not either mandated by law or actually,118.218,3.003
contributing to the public good.,121.221,2.402
It also rescinds a number of the previous,123.623,2.069
administration&amp;#39;s actions that don&amp;#39;t reflect this,125.692,3.436
administration&amp;#39;s priorities.,129.128,1.936
"The full list is laid out in the executive order,",131.064,1.868
"which will be provided to you later today, after",132.932,2.336
the President signs it.,135.268,1.668
"Next, the order directs the EPA to take several",136.936,2.57
actions to reflect this President&amp;#39;s environmental,139.506,2.902
"and economic goals, including a review",142.408,3.137
of the new performance standards for coal-fired,145.545,2.936
and natural-gas-fired power plants that amounted to,148.481,2.403
a de facto ban on new coal plant production,150.884,3.169
in the United States.,154.053,1.435
"This is great news for states like Wyoming,",155.488,2.036
"West Virginia, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and others.",157.524,3.303
"Finally, the order establishes a directive for agencies to use",160.827,2.969
the best available science and economics in their regulatory,163.796,3.304
analysis moving forward.,167.1,2.335
"For too long, the federal government has acted like",169.435,1.836
a barrier to energy independence and innovation.,171.271,2.836
"By reducing unnecessary regulatory obstacles,",174.107,2.869
we&amp;#39;ll free up American energy companies,176.976,2.102
"to responsibly use our vast energy resources,",179.078,3.17
protecting the environment while creating well-paying,182.248,2.269
jobs throughout the country.,184.517,2.236
American electricity producers have already,186.753,2.736
done an amazing job of adapting and utilizing new,189.489,3.537
technologies to deliver clean power to the United States.,193.026,4.204
"Under President Trump, the federal government",197.23,1.902
is going to acknowledge that progress and adjust,199.132,3.603
its priorities accordingly.,202.735,2.036
"Moving on, later in the afternoon, the President",204.771,1.701
will meet with Secretary of State Tillerson,206.472,1.836
and Secretary of Homeland Security Kelly.,208.308,2.602
"And this evening, the President and the First Lady",210.91,1.669
will host a reception here in the White House,212.579,2.002
for senators and their spouses.,214.581,1.634
This will be the first time that President Trump,216.215,2.703
has invited all current senators to the White,218.918,1.769
"House, and he looks forward to this",220.687,1.935
"opportunity, as well as to speak with some of",222.622,1.802
the senators about the places where they can come together,224.424,2.602
and make this country better.,227.026,1.635
One of those places that he hopes to find common,228.661,1.869
ground with Senate Democrats here tonight is,230.53,2.502
the confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.,233.032,3.938
"Yesterday, many Senate Democrats began declaring",236.97,2.035
support for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer&amp;#39;s,239.005,2.369
partisan filibuster of Judge Neil Gorsuch.,241.374,2.603
"And as I&amp;#39;ve said, these senators should get -- if",243.977,2.135
"these senators get their way, this would be the",246.112,2.002
first successful filibuster of a nominee,248.114,2.035
to join the Supreme Court.,250.149,1.702
Leading Democrats have lamented these tactics,251.851,2.002
as recently as last year.,253.853,1.869
"Senator Schumer, in fact, wrote last year in an",255.722,2.035
"op-ed in the New York Daily News -- and I quote,",257.757,2.402
"&amp;quot;At a time when Americans want to move forward,",260.159,2.336
the last thing we need -- the last thing is a new recipe,262.495,4.171
for gridlock at the Supreme Court.&amp;quot;,266.666,2.002
Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton said of,268.668,2.269
the Supreme Court confirmation progress -- &amp;quot;It should not,270.937,2.736
be an exercise in political brinkmanship,273.673,2.336
"and partisan posturing,&amp;quot; and that nominees deserve a",276.009,2.836
&amp;quot;full and fair hearing followed by a vote.&amp;quot;,278.845,3.57
Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri tweeted &amp;quot;The,282.415,2.703
constitution says the Senate shall advise and consent.,285.118,2.669
And that means having an up-or-down vote.&amp;quot;,287.787,2.169
"So, who are Senate Democrats going to enact",289.956,3.203
this on in extraordinary lengths to block?,293.159,3.17
"It&amp;#39;s an individual, frankly, who their body,",296.329,1.935
"including Senator Schumer, unanimously confirmed",298.264,2.603
for a seat on the 10th Circuit not too long ago.,300.867,2.803
This is a judge who received a unanimous &amp;quot;well,303.67,2.235
"qualified rating&amp;quot; by the American Bar Association,",305.905,2.936
was a Harvard Law graduate who received,308.841,1.735
the Edward J. Randolph Award for outstanding service at,310.576,3.003
the Department of Justice.,313.579,1.535
So it can&amp;#39;t be their qualifications they&amp;#39;re,315.114,1.702
taking issue with.,316.816,1.435
"Judge Gorsuch is, frankly, a mainstream judge.",318.251,3.17
Here are some figures and facts to point that out.,321.421,2.902
"Number one, in 98 percent of the cases in which he",324.323,2.169
"issued the opinion, he received the unanimous",326.492,2.503
support of all of his colleagues.,328.995,2.035
"Second, in divided cases over the last five years",331.03,2.636
involving both Republican and Democrat-appointed,333.666,2.97
"judges, Judge Gorsuch sided with the Democrat-appointed",336.636,2.636
judge one in three times.,339.272,2.102
"When the shoe was on the other foot, when a Supreme",341.374,1.968
Court nominee for a Democratic President,343.342,2.336
went through the confirmation hearings and meetings with,345.678,2.436
"senators from both parties, neither Justices",348.114,2.869
Kagan nor Sotomayor faced an attempted Senate filibuster.,350.983,4.739
Both received Republican votes in support,355.722,1.735
of their confirmations.,357.457,1.635
"In fact, during the Kagan nomination, on the Senate",359.092,1.935
"floor, when Senator Harry Reid planned to file",361.027,2.769
"a cloture motion to bring Kagan to a vote, it was",363.796,2.536
then-Senator and now current Attorney General,366.332,2.469
"Jeff Sessions who stopped him and said, &amp;quot;I have",368.801,2.97
a high standard before I would attempt to block,371.771,1.935
"an up or down vote,&amp;quot; and asked Senator Reid",373.706,2.036
to proceed with a vote without the need for,375.742,1.901
overcoming a Republican filibuster.,377.643,2.67
Judge Gorsuch has met with most of the Senate,380.313,1.802
Democratic caucus.,382.115,1.401
He has gone through days of hearings and answered,383.516,2.069
probing questions.,385.585,1.201
He is eminently qualified and deserves the deference,386.786,3.17
and consideration from the minority Senate Democrats,389.956,2.669
that President Obama&amp;#39;s selections were given once,392.625,2.469
they had gone through the confirmation process.,395.094,2.97
A few things I want to highlight.,398.064,1.835
"Last night, the President announced his intent",399.899,1.802
to nominate Makan Delrahim to serve as Assistant,401.701,4.604
Attorney General of the Anti-Trust Divisio at the,406.305,2.403
Department of Justice.,408.708,1.468
"And this morning, we announced the President&amp;#39;s",410.176,1.568
declaration that a major disaster exists,411.744,2.002
in the State of Nevada and ordered federal assistance,413.746,2.703
to supplement recovery effort in the areas,416.449,1.968
"affected by severe storms, flooding, and mudslides",418.417,3.671
this past February.,422.088,1.568
"And finally, this morning, the President was pleased",423.656,1.702
to see that Ford announced $1.2 billion investment,425.358,3.37
"in three manufacturing facilities in Michigan,",428.728,2.369
just two weeks after automobile executives,431.097,2.102
came to the White House and met with the President.,433.199,2.302
This adds to the growing wave of positive news --,435.501,2.803
jobs news under the President and continued,438.304,2.002
"the investment from Charter Communications,",440.306,2.336
and his approval for the Keystone XL pipeline on Friday.,442.642,3.77
"In addition, Energy Transfer Partners reported",446.412,2.369
Monday that the Dakota Access pipeline has been,448.781,2.603
filled with oil as they enter the final stages,451.384,4.171
of preparation that will finally put this into service.,455.555,1.968
"According to data released by the Conference Board,",457.523,2.569
in March consumer confidence &amp;quot;soared&amp;quot; to,460.092,2.203
its highest level in 16 years.,462.295,1.902
And from individual announcements to,464.197,1.468
significant boosts in both consumer and CEO,465.665,2.335
"confidence generally, it&amp;#39;s clear that the President&amp;#39;s",468,2.403
economic agenda is what America&amp;#39;s businesses,470.403,2.803
have been waiting for.,473.206,1.234
These businesses have spent years being held,474.44,1.935
"back by unnecessary bureaucratic red tape,",476.375,2.57
and what we&amp;#39;re seeing now is just the taste of the,478.945,1.868
heights our economy can reach once those burdens are removed.,480.813,3.67
"And lastly, I want to make a comment on a false",484.483,2.536
report regarding former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates.,487.019,4.138
"As a matter of fact, I&amp;#39;d like to walk you through",491.157,1.768
the sequence of events just to make sure that,492.925,1.535
everyone is abundantly clear on what happened.,494.46,2.803
"On March 14th, Chairman Nunes and Ranking Member",497.263,2.603
Schiff invited Sally Yates to testify on March 28th.,499.866,4.104
"On March 23rd, Sally Yates&amp;#39;s attorney sent",503.97,2.135
a letter to the Department of Justice asking for,506.105,2.669
their consent to testify without constraints.,508.774,2.103
"On March 24th, the Department of Justice",510.877,2.535
responded the President owns those privileges to,513.412,2.803
discuss the communications they were requesting,516.215,1.902
to talk about and referred them to the White House.,518.117,2.87
"Also on the 24th, Ms. Yates&amp;#39;s attorney sent",520.987,2.068
a letter to the White House Counsel requesting,523.055,2.336
"that consent, specifically stating that if they did",525.391,2.669
"not receive a response by March 27th at 10:00 a.m.,",528.06,3.204
they would &amp;quot;conclude that the White House does not,531.264,2.502
assert executive privilege over these matters.&amp;quot;,533.766,3.07
The White House did not respond and took no action,536.836,2.636
that prevented Ms. Yates from testifying.,539.472,2.302
That&amp;#39;s the story.,541.774,1.034
That&amp;#39;s what the documents show.,542.808,1.836
"And with that, I&amp;#39;m glad to take some questions.",544.644,2.369
"The Press: Can I follow on that, Sean?",547.013,0.901
"Mr. Spicer: Of course you can, John Roberts.",547.914,1.067
The Press: I&amp;#39;d like to follow on that.,548.981,1.635
There are reports that even though the hearing,550.616,2.436
"that was set for the 27th was not scheduled, it was",553.052,3.337
cancelled by Devin Nunes to prevent this White,556.389,3.169
House from publicly invoking a claim of,559.558,3.104
executive privilege.,562.662,1.034
Could you speak to that?,563.696,1.401
"Mr. Spicer: I hope she testifies, I look forward to it.",565.097,2.002
"It was never -- let&amp;#39;s be honest, the hearing was",567.099,2.336
never -- we actually never notified.,569.435,3.003
"If they choose to move forward, great.",572.438,1.768
We have no problem with her testifying.,574.206,2.236
Plain and simple.,576.442,0.801
The report in The Washington Post,577.243,1.668
is 100 percent false.,578.911,1.702
"The letters that they, frankly, publish on their",580.613,2.169
website all back up everything I just read.,582.782,3.203
All of the letters are available on their website,585.985,2.002
-- I hate to give them the traffic -- but the reality,587.987,2.369
"is, is that they specifically say,",590.356,1.969
"if you don&amp;#39;t respond, we&amp;#39;re going to go ahead.",592.325,1.868
We didn&amp;#39;t respond.,594.193,1.101
We encouraged them to go ahead.,595.294,1.635
"But to suggest in any way, shape, or form that we",596.929,2.569
stood in the way of that is 100 percent false.,599.498,4.271
Brian.,603.769,1.569
"The Press: A couple of things you said earlier,",605.338,1.167
a couple of quick follow-ups.,606.505,1.202
You said you want the agencies to use best,607.707,2.902
available science.,610.609,1.402
Does that meant there&amp;#39;s going to be no further,612.011,1.401
"scientific research, you don&amp;#39;t want to fund",613.412,2.303
additional scientific research?,615.715,2.202
And number two: What other issues do you like to see,617.917,3.07
the President reach out to Democrats?,620.987,2.802
"Mr. Spicer: So on the first one, best science",623.789,2.503
is best science.,626.292,0.834
And that&amp;#39;s whatever --,627.126,1.702
The Press: Best available is what you said.,628.828,1.268
Mr. Spicer: Right.,630.096,1.134
"Well, if it&amp;#39;s not available, it&amp;#39;s tough to use it.",631.23,1.301
Just as a matter of practicality.,632.531,2.47
"The Press: Well, but is that a code for not using --",635.001,1.201
"Mr. Spicer: No, it&amp;#39;s a code for it&amp;#39;s got to be available.",636.202,3.17
"That&amp;#39;s it, plain and simple.",639.372,1.101
You shouldn&amp;#39;t read anything into that.,640.473,0.934
And I think the President will speak more to that at,641.407,1.935
today&amp;#39;s signing at 1:30 p.m.,643.342,3.971
"-- at 2:00 p.m., rather, I&amp;#39;m sorry.",647.313,1.401
The Press: And are Democrats -- Mr. Spicer:,648.714,1.602
I think there&amp;#39;s a whole host of issues.,650.316,1.334
I talked yesterday about healthcare.,651.65,1.335
"If they want to come together on infrastructure, tax reform,",652.985,2.903
we&amp;#39;d love to have as much support as possible.,655.888,2.236
Eamon.,658.124,0.7
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",658.824,0.901
A couple questions.,659.725,0.768
One on coal.,660.493,1.868
"Your actions today, the White House is saying that",662.361,2.436
they&amp;#39;re going to reverse President Obama&amp;#39;s,664.797,1.368
so-called &amp;quot;war on coal.&amp;quot;,666.165,1.568
But a lot of people in the coal industry suggest that,667.733,2.036
jobs are just not going to come back in that,669.769,1.568
"industry, based on the way the industry has changed,",671.337,2.502
technology and other things.,673.839,1.302
Does this administration have an estimate of how,675.141,2.402
many jobs will be created as a result of the actions,677.543,2.302
it&amp;#39;s taking today?,679.845,1.302
"Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not aware of one, an estimate.",681.147,1.434
I know that the President has already met with some,682.581,1.535
"of the coal miners the other day, and Senators",684.116,3.704
"Manchin and Capito, in particular, from",687.82,1.902
"West Virginia, and others from Kentucky that were here when",689.722,2.369
we did that EO signing a few days ago.,692.091,2.102
"I will tell you that from a mining perspective, the",694.193,3.77
"miners and the owners are very, very bullish on this.",697.963,2.87
"So, the people who are actually in the business",700.833,3.47
"applaud this effort, believe that it will",704.303,1.835
do a lot to revive the industry.,706.138,1.602
It&amp;#39;s obviously a private industry so I&amp;#39;m not going,707.74,2.369
to get into who does what.,710.109,1.668
But I know that the industry itself said so.,711.777,3.737
Steve.,715.514,2.703
"The Press: On the court announcement, you just",718.217,1.001
said that the announcement today comes two weeks,719.218,1.902
after the automakers met here at the White House.,721.12,2.436
Did the White House or the President do anything in,723.556,2.002
that meeting that led to this announcement today?,725.558,2.068
Mr. Spicer: I think there&amp;#39;s been some,727.626,1.769
regulatory effort and some commitments on the,729.395,4.071
regulatory efforts going forward in the future that,733.466,4.27
I think may have played a role.,737.736,2.036
I would ask Ford on that.,739.772,1.401
I think it&amp;#39;s a continued sign of it.,741.173,1.802
I think we have seen a number of industry,742.975,2.769
"leaders, union leaders, truckers, truck companies",745.744,3.671
"come in, talk about burdens.",749.415,1.368
And I think there&amp;#39;s been several cases where meetings,750.783,3.437
"in the White House -- or, frankly, we went to Michigan",754.22,2.135
and held that roundtable out there as well -- that meetings,756.355,3.203
that we have have a very positive follow-up in terms,759.558,3.537
"of a commitment from a company or an industry to create jobs,",763.095,4.671
to invest more in this country.,767.766,2.436
But in each of these cases --,770.202,2.436
"The Press: Is the White House, then, going to get",772.638,1.268
political credit for this announcement today?,773.906,1.902
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;ll leave it up to Ford to make,775.808,2.102
that determination.,777.91,0.867
I think that we&amp;#39;re obviously pleased with,778.777,1.268
more Americans getting jobs throughout various sectors.,780.045,3.671
"And I think that we&amp;#39;ll continue, and the President",783.716,2.102
has made it very clear that he continues,785.818,1.368
to fight to bring back jobs and manufacturing here,787.186,2.269
in the country.,789.455,0.667
Steve.,790.122,1.035
"The Press: Sean, as you begin looking seriously",791.157,1.568
"at tax reform, could you just go through what is the President&amp;#39;s",792.725,2.536
bottom line?,795.261,1.301
"Does it need to have middle-class tax relief,",796.562,2.302
corporate tax relief?,798.864,1.702
"Can you do it comprehensively, or piecemeal?",800.566,3.236
Do you add infrastructure spending to it somehow?,803.802,3.137
How are you looking at this?,806.939,1.802
"Mr. Spicer: So, on the first two, those are both",808.741,3.303
key components -- the middle-class individual,812.044,3.504
tax piece of it and then the corporate rate,815.548,2.369
has to come down.,817.917,1.001
I think those are guiding principles that,818.918,1.735
the President has laid out.,820.653,1.601
"As far as how the process works, there are -- and I",822.254,5.906
don&amp;#39;t want to get ahead of the folks in the,828.16,2.569
"legislative affairs or the guys on Capitol Hill,",830.729,2.069
but I would suggest to you that there&amp;#39;s a prevailing,832.798,1.602
attitude out there that the FY18 reconciliation,834.4,4.371
is probably the most likely vehicle to move some of this.,838.771,3.103
"Again, what we want to do is keep a lot of options",841.874,2.936
on the table in terms of do we put infrastructure,844.81,2.803
"in, is there another vehicle to drive that.",847.613,1.602
But part of gathering folks together now from,849.215,5.138
"Capitol Hill, from industry, from groups,",854.353,1.568
"is to begin that discussion, to talk about what needs",855.921,5.039
"to go in, what the way forward is.",860.96,2.936
And so that conversation has begun and is continuing.,863.896,2.436
The Press: And when do you think you&amp;#39;ll have some,866.332,4.237
recommendations to take to the President?,870.569,1.935
"Mr. Spicer: Well, internally, the team has",872.504,2.77
been talking to him for a while.,875.274,2.035
I think there&amp;#39;s a bigger discussion that has,877.309,2.036
"to happen as we branch out with outside groups,",879.345,4.104
"industry, members of Capitol Hill, et cetera,",883.449,2.702
that start to formulate some additional listening,886.151,2.837
that needs to happen on this.,888.988,1.134
"And again, I think part of it is there&amp;#39;s a",890.122,2.703
legislative strategy that needs to tie into this.,892.825,2.302
Blake.,895.127,1.602
The Press: Is the White House currently involved,896.729,2.302
in any renegotiations of the healthcare bill?,899.031,3.804
"And if so, in what manner?",902.835,1.735
Mr. Spicer: Staff has met with individuals,904.57,2.936
and listened to them.,907.506,2.636
So I don&amp;#39;t know how detailed you want it.,910.142,3.937
Have we had some discussions and listened to ideas?,914.079,3.27
Yes.,917.349,1.268
Are we actively planning an immediate strategy?,918.617,2.77
Not at this time.,921.387,0.967
"I think there is a discussion that began,",922.354,1.602
"as I mentioned yesterday, of a lot of individuals",923.956,2.502
on both sides of the aisle reaching out to both,926.458,2.069
the President and key staff members to share ideas,928.527,4.037
and additional ways forward.,932.564,1.602
"So there has been a discussion, and I believe there will be",934.166,4.104
several more.,938.27,1.535
The Press: What would you say to the folks who have,939.805,1.502
a genuine concern that if you could not get,941.307,3.937
"healthcare done, how do you go about getting",945.244,2.569
big-ticket items like tax reform and infrastructure done?,947.813,2.936
"People say if you can&amp;#39;t get one, how are you going",950.749,3.103
to do the next?,953.852,1.135
What would you say to that concern?,954.987,1.968
"Mr. Spicer: Well, again, I think -- I mean, we&amp;#39;re",956.955,2.536
going to build a coalition for this.,959.491,1.702
I think each of them have different constituencies.,961.193,1.935
And I think we&amp;#39;re going to work with members on both,963.128,3.003
sides of the aisle on both of those big-ticket issues,966.131,2.002
to see where we can find agreement and move forward.,968.133,2.536
But I don&amp;#39;t want to prejudge the outcome,970.669,4.138
at this point.,974.807,0.667
John.,975.474,1.535
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",977.009,18.819
Just as a follow-up question on Blake&amp;#39;s.,995.828,1.635
Did the President himself have any discussions with,997.463,4.304
Speaker Ryan or Leader McCarthy or anyone over,1001.767,4.371
the weekend about healthcare and making an,1006.138,3.036
actual vote on the American Health Care Act?,1009.174,3.47
And one got the impression from Speaker Ryan today,1012.644,4.905
that he was going to try to pass this with,1017.549,1.669
"Republican votes, which would contradict some of",1019.218,2.769
your statements about reaching out to Democrats,1021.987,3.237
all along.,1025.224,1.001
Has any of this come up with discussions between,1026.225,2.402
each side of Pennsylvania Avenue?,1028.627,1.368
Mr. Spicer: So I think I talked yesterday -- they,1029.995,2.903
have spoken a few times about different,1032.898,4.905
"strategies, different ideas, different policy",1037.803,2.035
aspects to the bill.,1039.838,1.802
The Press: Over the weekend?,1041.64,0.868
Mr. Spicer: Absolutely.,1042.508,1.801
"At least on a number of -- at least two, maybe three",1044.309,2.436
"times, they&amp;#39;ve spoken.",1046.745,1.568
And I know several of our staff members have also,1048.313,2.67
"engaged in discussions, again, to talk about",1050.983,3.136
potential ways forward.,1054.119,1.368
"So, those conversations have occurred.",1055.487,1.535
I think that&amp;#39;s what I mentioned to Blake,1057.022,1.402
and I mentioned some of it yesterday.,1058.424,1.868
"And if we can find a way forward, well do it.",1060.292,2.836
"But, look, I don&amp;#39;t think -- just so we&amp;#39;re clear,",1063.128,2.703
"John, to your question, I&amp;#39;m not saying we&amp;#39;ve",1065.831,2.636
picked a strategy and we&amp;#39;re going to go with,1068.467,1.335
this group or that group.,1069.802,1.134
I think the President was -- several people reached,1070.936,6.139
out and expressed an interest.,1077.075,2.236
And the President&amp;#39;s view is that he&amp;#39;s willing,1079.311,2.236
to listen to them and hear what their ideas are.,1081.547,3.436
And I made a comment yesterday that was --,1084.983,3.337
"that just so we&amp;#39;re clear, we have -- let&amp;#39;s call it 205,",1088.32,3.904
"207, somewhere in there, votes, right?",1092.224,3.37
"Maybe 210, depending on what it is.",1095.594,2.736
The point that I made yesterday is to get,1098.33,2.302
"to 216, to get to 218, depending on the day",1100.632,2.269
"of the week, there are certain things that people",1102.901,2.836
want that would take what I think the President,1105.737,2.336
views as a very good bill that weren&amp;#39;t worth doing,1108.073,2.669
it because they would make the deal bad.,1110.742,2.536
"And so the question is, can we",1113.278,1.368
add the additional votes in ways that enhance the bill,1114.646,7.408
or bring people over that have been previous skeptics?,1122.054,2.002
"But there&amp;#39;s a way in which people are saying, &amp;quot;Hey, if",1124.056,2.069
"you bring me on board with these five provisions,",1126.125,2.168
"then I&amp;#39;m on board,&amp;quot; in which either, A, take",1128.293,3.237
"people off the bill, or don&amp;#39;t make it as strong",1131.53,3.804
and make it a bad deal.,1135.334,1.234
And I think that&amp;#39;s the balancing act that has to happen.,1136.568,1.702
"One is, can you add additional folks",1138.27,2.636
on without pushing additional folks off.,1140.906,2.769
"And two is that, what you have to add to the bill,",1143.675,2.703
does it make it stronger or does it not?,1146.378,2.269
Because I think there are suggestions by some out,1148.647,2.703
there that have said we&amp;#39;re willing to come along with,1151.35,1.668
"the bill, but in doing so it would make it a bad deal.",1153.018,3.303
"And that&amp;#39;s an important aspect, is how do you take",1156.321,3.637
whatever that number is that we have now and get,1159.958,2.937
it up to 216 to pass without making -- without,1162.895,4.638
losing people and/or making it a bad deal?,1167.533,2.302
"The Press: Sean, does it --",1169.835,1.468
"Mr. Spicer: Hold on, Glenn, I&amp;#39;ve already --",1171.303,1.134
"The Press: -- done with Republican votes, not Democrats?",1172.437,2.203
"Mr. Spicer: However we get there, John.",1174.64,1.501
Francesca.,1176.141,1.568
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",1177.709,1.802
"Yesterday, you weren&amp;#39;t able to tell us very much about",1179.511,2.136
Congressman Nunes&amp;#39; visit to the White House,1181.647,1.868
or to the White House grounds to view classified,1183.515,1.969
information last week.,1185.484,2.369
A Democrat on the committee today said that,1187.853,2.969
the White House would have known that he was here.,1190.822,2.369
The same Democrat also said that it looked like,1193.191,2.036
a criminal cover-up to him.,1195.227,2.536
"My question to you is, have you learned",1197.763,2.235
any more information since we had this conversation,1199.998,2.202
yesterday about how he would have even gotten,1202.2,2.269
in and how he would have gotten cleared?,1204.469,1.902
And do you think that Congressman Nunes should,1206.371,2.102
recuse himself from being in charge of the Russian,1208.473,1.902
investigation at this point?,1210.375,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: Well, number one, on the latter part of",1211.71,2.102
"that, it&amp;#39;s not up to me.",1213.812,0.801
He&amp;#39;s a member of the House.,1214.613,0.901
He&amp;#39;s appointed by the Speaker.,1215.514,1.568
That is entirely up to the Speaker and the members of,1217.082,2.035
the House of Representatives.,1219.117,1.569
We&amp;#39;re not going to start commenting on that kind,1220.686,1.902
of stuff.,1222.588,1.034
I do think that he is running an investigation,1223.622,2.069
which we asked for.,1225.691,1.268
And I think the thing that&amp;#39;s important to note,1226.959,3.57
is there is somewhat of a double standard when it,1230.529,1.635
comes to classified information.,1232.164,1.835
"When leaks are made illegally to the press,",1233.999,2.769
"and you all report them, the coverage focuses",1236.768,2.469
almost entirely on the substance of the,1239.237,1.569
"allegation and that are part of an illegal lead,",1240.806,3.436
"not on the illegal nature of the disclosure, the",1244.242,3.037
"identity of the leaks, or their agenda.",1247.279,2.102
"But when the information that is occurring now,",1249.381,2.002
which is two individuals who were properly cleared,1251.383,2.636
"-- or three, or whoever he met with -- I don&amp;#39;t know",1254.019,4.638
-- that they are sharing stuff that is entirely,1258.657,2.469
legal with the appropriate clearances -- and then,1261.126,2.836
there is an obsession on the process.,1263.962,1.902
And it&amp;#39;s sort of -- it&amp;#39;s a backwards way that when,1265.864,2.836
you all report on stuff with sources that are,1268.7,2.136
leaking -- illegally leaking classified,1270.836,2.435
"information, that&amp;#39;s appropriate and fine.",1273.271,2.67
No one questions that -- the substance and material.,1275.941,2.903
"When two individuals, or however many are engaged",1278.844,2.102
"in this process, have a discussion that is 100 percent",1280.946,4.705
"legal and appropriate and cleared, suddenly the obsession",1285.651,3.269
becomes about the process and not the substance.,1288.92,2.336
And I think that it is somewhat reckless and --,1291.256,2.97
how the conversation over classified information is,1294.226,4.871
discussed without -- while sort of attempting to press,1299.097,2.57
a false narrative that exists.,1301.667,1.835
"So, while it is completely appropriate to share",1303.502,3.069
classified information with individuals who are,1306.571,3.27
"cleared, it is clearly not the case to do that when",1309.841,4.171
it is illegally leaked out.,1314.012,1.802
And I think that&amp;#39;s sort of the irony of how this,1315.814,2.002
whole conversation has gone.,1317.816,2.836
John.,1320.652,0.667
"The Press: Thanks, a lot, Sean.",1321.319,1.535
Just following up on your statement in regards to,1322.854,3.437
The Washington Post story that you say is false.,1326.291,2.669
Did the White House Counsel Office ever,1328.96,2.67
consider invoking privilege as it relates,1331.63,2.936
to Sally Yates testifying before this congressional committee?,1334.566,4.638
Mr. Spicer: No.,1339.204,0.968
The Press: And why is that?,1340.172,1.167
You certainly would be in a position to invoke privilege.,1341.339,2.269
"After all, these were privileged communications",1343.608,2.47
between the Acting Attorney General,1346.078,1.968
and the executive office of the President.,1348.046,1.702
That would fall into privilege.,1349.748,1.034
"Mr. Spicer: Because I know this will be a shocker,",1350.782,1.135
"but, again, part of it is that I think that we&amp;#39;ve",1351.917,1.802
been very clear that when you actually get to the bottom,1353.719,2.902
"of the facts, every single person who has been",1356.621,2.536
"briefed on this, as I&amp;#39;ve said ad nauseam from this",1359.157,2.703
"podium, that they have been very clear that there",1361.86,2.236
is no connection between the President or the staff,1364.096,4.704
here and anyone doing anything with Russia.,1368.8,1.936
"And I think that the view here was, great,",1370.736,2.435
go share what you know.,1373.171,1.602
"So, no.",1374.773,0.867
And that&amp;#39;s why The Washington Post should be,1375.64,2.069
ashamed of how it handled this story.,1377.709,1.468
It was 100 percent false.,1379.177,1.902
The letters that they actually publish back up,1381.079,2.436
"exactly what we&amp;#39;re saying, that she was asked about",1383.515,3.103
this information -- her attorney asked the DOJ.,1386.618,3.303
The DOJ said that she had to ask the White House.,1389.921,2.203
"They made it very clear, if you don&amp;#39;t do this, we",1392.124,2.102
are going to go forward.,1394.226,1.601
We had no objection to her going forward.,1395.827,3.003
That&amp;#39;s it.,1398.83,5.506
"The Press: Just quickly following up on that,",1404.336,1.701
I have two questions on two different topics.,1406.037,3.17
So we&amp;#39;re taking what you&amp;#39;re saying,1409.207,2.503
as assurances that Chairman Nunes&amp;#39; decision to call off,1411.71,2.769
that hearing did not have anything to do with any,1414.479,2.303
pressure from with White House?,1416.782,1.167
Mr. Spicer: No.,1417.949,0.734
The Press: Okay.,1418.683,0.835
Thank you.,1419.518,0.934
"On a different topic, we&amp;#39;re seeing more states",1420.452,2.536
"-- Maine, Virginia, and Kansas, specifically --",1422.988,2.369
moving to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care,1425.357,2.235
"Act, joining the 30-plus states that have already done that.",1427.592,2.703
What is President Trump&amp;#39;s message to Republican,1430.295,2.269
legislators and legislators generally,1432.564,2.035
in those states now that the Affordable Care Act&amp;#39;s future,1434.599,2.87
is so uncertain?,1437.469,1.935
Mr. Spicer: I think there&amp;#39;s a reason he,1439.404,2.035
"explained to Congress, and especially members who have",1441.439,2.837
"talked about entitlement expansion, why we should",1444.276,2.002
have passed this bill last week and why we need,1446.278,2.736
to address it now.,1449.014,1.635
This is a major issue.,1450.649,1.334
"It was one of our talking points, so I hope they listen.",1451.983,4.338
The Press: Does he encourage the expansion?,1456.321,1.335
Mr. Spicer: I think he understands that the way,1457.656,2.969
that it was handled in terms of the able-bodied,1460.625,3.204
provision under that right now are leading to an,1463.829,2.836
"implosion on that piece of the entitlement, and that",1466.665,2.802
"there was an opportunity to refocus it, and to push",1469.467,2.536
the money and a lot of the authority back,1472.003,3.003
to the states to best determine how to handle issues within,1475.006,2.77
their states -- both in terms of high-risk,1477.776,4.137
pools and individuals that they wanted to cover.,1481.913,3.003
"So, we -- frankly, the bill made it a much more",1484.916,2.67
state&amp;#39;s rights program and a much more state&amp;#39;s rights,1487.586,3.603
decision-making process in terms of how to care,1491.189,1.969
for the populations that they had to address.,1493.158,2.736
Cecilia.,1495.894,1.201
The Press: Thank you.,1497.095,0.868
Just a couple things on the Yates thing.,1497.963,1.468
So how and when exactly did the White House,1499.431,2.669
encourage her to testify?,1502.1,1.301
"Mr. Spicer: Well, the letter that her attorney",1503.401,2.736
"sent literally says that, if we do not receive",1506.137,4.739
"a response by March 27th at 10:00 a.m., I will",1510.876,3.036
conclude that the White House does not assert,1513.912,2.302
executive privilege over the matters with respect,1516.214,2.87
to hearings or otherwise.,1519.084,1.701
I don&amp;#39;t think you can be any clearer than that.,1520.785,3.204
The Press: And so you&amp;#39;re saying now executive,1523.989,0.967
"privilege does not -- Mr. Spicer: No, no,",1524.956,1.835
I&amp;#39;m not saying anything.,1526.791,0.768
I&amp;#39;m literally -- that&amp;#39;s what she wrote.,1527.559,2.636
"The action was, if you don&amp;#39;t act, then we will",1530.195,1.902
assume the following.,1532.097,0.967
Great.,1533.064,0.935
I don&amp;#39;t think that you can read that any other way.,1533.999,1.801
"It was very -- she&amp;#39;s a, I&amp;#39;m sure, a very talented",1535.8,2.97
"-- he is a very talented lawyer, and wrote it",1538.77,2.269
specifically for it.,1541.039,0.934
"We read it that way, and chose to not act because",1541.973,2.703
we have no problem with her testifying --,1544.676,1.868
plain and simple.,1546.544,1.235
The Press: So executive privilege is not an issue,1547.779,1.235
for Sally Yates -- would not have been an issue,1549.014,2.002
for Sally Yates testifying?,1551.016,1.401
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s correct.,1552.417,0.901
"The Press: Okay, thank you.",1553.318,1.034
And following one issue -- do you want to add?,1554.352,2.336
"Mr. Spicer: No, I just -- it&amp;#39;s interesting, I mean,",1556.688,2.569
"this is very clearly worded, and yet somehow",1559.257,2.903
you&amp;#39;re asking me how to interpret that in any,1562.16,2.136
other way than literally reading plain English.,1564.296,3.036
The Press: Okay.,1567.332,0.934
Interpret something else for me: Does the President,1568.266,1.168
still believe that climate change is a hoax?,1569.434,1.702
Mr. Spicer: I think you will hear more today,1571.136,2.302
about the climate and what he believes.,1573.438,1.969
I think he understands -- he does not believe that,1575.407,4.437
"-- as I mentioned at the outset, that there is",1579.844,1.969
"a binary choice between job creation, economic growth,",1581.813,4.104
and caring about the environment.,1585.917,1.368
And that&amp;#39;s what we should be focusing on.,1587.285,1.335
"I think, at the end of the day, where we should be",1588.62,1.935
focusing on is making sure that all Americans have,1590.555,2.336
"clean water, clean air, and that we do what we can",1592.891,2.302
to preserve and protect our environment.,1595.193,4.204
"April, go ahead.",1599.397,1.035
"The Press: All right, thank you.",1600.432,1.001
Sean -- don&amp;#39;t seem so happy.,1601.433,5.305
"Anyway, with all of these investigations, questions",1606.738,5.138
"of what is is, how does this administration try",1611.876,5.072
to revamp its image?,1616.948,1.869
"Two and a half months in, you&amp;#39;ve got this Yates",1618.817,2.402
"story today, you&amp;#39;ve got other things going on,",1621.219,2.202
"you&amp;#39;ve got Russia, you&amp;#39;ve got wiretapping, you&amp;#39;ve got --",1623.421,2.57
"Mr. Spicer: No, we don&amp;#39;t have that.",1625.991,2.268
The Press: There are investigations on Capitol Hill,1628.259,2.303
"-- Mr. Spicer: No, no -- I get it.",1630.562,1.001
But you keep -- I&amp;#39;ve said it from the day that I got,1631.563,2.869
here until whatever that there is no connection.,1634.432,2.469
You&amp;#39;ve got Russia.,1636.901,1.202
If the President puts Russian salad dressing,1638.103,2.202
"on his salad tonight, somehow that&amp;#39;s a Russian connection.",1640.305,3.07
But every single person --,1643.375,1.701
The Press: It&amp;#39;s beyond that.,1645.076,1.535
You&amp;#39;re making it --,1646.611,1.235
"Mr. Spicer: Well, no -- I appreciate your agenda here,",1647.846,1.168
but the reality is --,1649.014,1.101
The Press: It&amp;#39;s not my agenda.,1650.115,1.001
"Mr. Spicer: No, hold on.",1651.116,0.834
"At some point, report the facts.",1651.95,2.302
The facts are that every single person who has been,1654.252,1.602
briefed on this subject has come away with the,1655.854,1.868
"same conclusion -- Republican, Democrat.",1657.722,2.136
"So, I&amp;#39;m sorry that that disgusts you.",1659.858,2.369
You&amp;#39;re shaking your head.,1662.227,1.067
"I appreciate it, but --",1663.294,1.502
"The Press: I&amp;#39;m shaking my head and I&amp;#39;m listening,",1664.796,1.034
and I&amp;#39;m trying to get --,1665.83,1.135
"Mr. Spicer: Okay, but understand this -- that at",1666.965,1.468
"some point, the facts are what they are, and every",1668.433,1.034
single person who has been briefed on this situation,1669.467,2.937
with respect to the situation with Russia --,1672.404,2.669
"Republican, Democrat, Obama-appointee, career --",1675.073,3.971
have all come to the same conclusion.,1679.044,2.002
"At some point, April, you&amp;#39;re going to have",1681.046,2.035
"to take &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; for an answer, with respect to whether",1683.081,2.102
or not there was collusion.,1685.183,1.468
The Press: But my question was how do you change,1686.651,2.703
the perception of --,1689.354,1.168
Mr. Spicer: We&amp;#39;re going to keep doing everything we&amp;#39;re doing,1690.522,1.468
to make sure that,1691.99,1.034
the President -- that what the President told,1693.024,1.301
the American people he was going to do to fulfill,1694.325,2.336
"those pledges and promises that he made, to bring",1696.661,2.236
"back jobs, to grow the economy, to keep our",1698.897,3.136
nation safe -- that&amp;#39;s what he&amp;#39;s been focused on since day one.,1702.033,3.103
We&amp;#39;re going to keep focusing on that,1705.136,1.568
every single day.,1706.704,1.569
The Press: But when Condi Rice comes Friday.,1708.273,1.134
Condi Rice did not support this President.,1709.407,2.002
She did not go to the convention.,1711.409,2.169
"She comes -- what is on the agenda, and how is",1713.578,2.703
their relationship?,1716.281,1.034
Has it healed since 2006 when he used a very,1717.315,3.27
negative word to describe her?,1720.585,1.635
"Mr. Spicer: So, here&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ll -- hey, it&amp;#39;s",1722.22,1.702
interesting that you ask those two questions,1723.922,1.334
back-to-back.,1725.256,1.035
"On the one hand, you&amp;#39;re saying what are we doing",1726.291,1.368
"to improve our image, and then here he is,",1727.659,1.802
"once again, meeting somebody that hasn&amp;#39;t been",1729.461,2.736
a big supporter of his.,1732.197,1.334
The Press: But he called her that negative name in 2006.,1733.531,2.236
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, but you put it -- April, hold on.",1735.767,2.703
It seems like you&amp;#39;re hell-bent on trying,1738.47,1.668
to make sure that whatever image you want to tell,1740.138,2.769
"about this White House stays, because at the end",1742.907,1.902
of the day --,1744.809,1.135
The Press: I am just reporting what --,1745.944,1.268
"Mr. Spicer: Okay, but you know what?",1747.212,1.601
"You&amp;#39;re asking me a question, and I&amp;#39;m going to answer it, which",1748.813,1.769
is the President -- I&amp;#39;m sorry.,1750.582,1.201
Please stop shaking your head again.,1751.783,2.369
"But at some point, the reality is that this",1754.152,1.835
President continues to reach out to individuals,1755.987,2.169
"who&amp;#39;ve supported him, who didn&amp;#39;t support him --",1758.156,2.669
"Republicans, Democrats -- to try to bring the",1760.825,1.568
country together and move forward on an agenda,1762.393,1.869
that&amp;#39;s going to help every American.,1764.262,1.335
"That&amp;#39;s it, plain and simple.",1765.597,0.867
"So, if you&amp;#39;re asking what we&amp;#39;re doing, I think we",1766.464,2.269
"continue to do it, which is to bring groups",1768.733,2.002
"together that have been supportive of him, that",1770.735,2.336
"haven&amp;#39;t been supportive of him, but that to share",1773.071,2.302
"a goal, which is finding common ground on areas",1775.373,3.504
"of national security, of personal security,",1778.877,2.636
"of economic security, of job creation, of safer communities,",1781.513,4.304
"of education, of healthcare that can unite us as a country",1785.817,4.004
and make the country stronger.,1789.821,1.668
The Press: -- about Russia and Tillerson Friday?,1791.489,1.602
Mr. Spicer: I think they&amp;#39;re going to --,1793.091,1.201
"I&amp;#39;m not ready to -- when we&amp;#39;re done with that,",1794.292,2.269
we&amp;#39;ll see if we can have a readout.,1796.561,1.435
The Press: (Inaudible.),1797.996,1.468
"Mr. Spicer: Hold on, I understand that.",1799.464,1.268
We&amp;#39;re not at Friday yet.,1800.732,0.967
I will have a readout when that&amp;#39;s done.,1801.699,1.402
I know the pool needs to get to the vans for the signing.,1803.101,3.97
Thank you.,1807.071,0.734
