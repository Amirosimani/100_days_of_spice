"Mr. Spicer: Good morning, everyone -- or it&amp;#39;s",0,2.635
"technically afternoon, I guess.",2.635,4.505
Sorry to move it up and screw up the schedule,7.14,1.735
"a little, but we&amp;#39;ve got a couple of events this",8.875,1.735
"afternoon so I&amp;#39;ve got to get through this, get some",10.61,3.771
questions and then got to move on.,14.381,2.802
But we&amp;#39;ve got two more on-camera briefings,17.183,2.036
the rest of the week.,19.219,2.035
"This morning, the President just wrapped up",21.254,1.902
-- or is continuing to -- I know some of the pool,23.156,1.668
just left -- but the President is currently,24.824,1.769
hosting an opioid and drug-abuse listening,26.593,1.868
"session with senior administration officials,",28.461,2.603
"governors, experts in the psychology of drug",31.064,2.536
"addiction, recovery-awareness",33.6,2.169
"advocates, and others who have been affected",35.769,2.335
by the opioid crisis.,38.104,1.769
Drug abuse has crippled communities across this nation.,39.873,3.236
"In 2015, more than 52,000 Americans -- that&amp;#39;s 144",43.109,4.738
"people a day -- died from a drug overdose, with 63",47.847,3.637
"percent involving an opioid, according to the CDC.",51.484,4.605
Drug overdoses are now the leading cause,56.089,2.169
of accidental death in our country.,58.258,2.269
As the President discussed with the group this,60.527,1.668
"morning, we won&amp;#39;t be able to address this academic",62.195,2.736
-- excuse me -- epidemic with a single solution.,64.931,2.736
"First, we must get struggling Americans the",67.667,3.237
help that they need.,70.904,1.268
Too many families have seen firsthand,72.172,1.601
"the destruction that drug abuse can bring, and we",73.773,2.903
must also focus prevention on law and enforcement.,76.676,3.337
Cheap heroin is flooding into our communities as,80.013,2.102
"drug cartels expand into the country, setting off",82.115,2.869
a chain reaction of addiction that spreads,84.984,2.603
from person to person and from family to family.,87.587,3.303
President Trump has already taken executive,90.89,1.869
action to strengthen law enforcement and dismantle,92.759,2.769
criminal cartels.,95.528,1.535
He and his team will continue to discuss how,97.063,1.635
best to root out this threat to American,98.698,2.369
communities with drug enforcement experts,101.067,1.902
as we continue this fight.,102.969,1.735
Stopping this epidemic is not -- is an issue that,104.704,4.238
"every American, regardless of your political",108.942,2.235
"background, can and must get behind.",111.177,2.236
We must work together from the leaders of the most --,113.413,2.335
from most local and community recovery and,115.748,2.703
support programs all the way to the White House,118.451,2.336
to solve this problem.,120.787,2.302
The White House took a big first step this morning,123.089,2.436
in our battle to combat drug addiction and the opioid,125.525,3.103
"crisis by meeting with these individuals, which",128.628,1.702
"included New Jersey Governor, Chris Christie,",130.33,2.502
who has been a leader on this issue.,132.832,1.835
"Attorney General Sessions, Education Secretary DeVos,",134.667,3.07
"Veterans Administration Secretary Shulkin,",137.737,2.336
"Homeland Security Secretary Kelly,",140.073,2.636
and others were in attendance.,142.709,1.434
A full list of participants has been provided.,144.143,3.671
I will say -- I know the pool was just in there --,147.814,2.536
it is -- some of the stories from some,150.35,3.069
of the individuals who have been involved in this with,153.419,1.836
a family member are unbelievably compelling.,155.255,2.736
Their desire to see and to work with the,157.991,4.337
administration to get this problem addressed is,162.328,3.17
"one that is plaguing communities, and I know",165.498,2.269
the President places it at the highest priority.,167.767,5.105
There was a mention by the drug -- the Acting,172.872,2.703
Administrator of the DEA that they have a program,175.575,4.204
"where, twice a year, they gather unwanted drugs.",179.779,3.303
Last year they gathered over a million pounds,183.082,1.702
of unwanted drugs.,184.784,1.001
"There&amp;#39;s 5,000 sites in which people across",185.785,3.07
America can drop off stuff in their medicine cabinet,188.855,2.736
that is no longer used to get it out of their house.,191.591,2.569
"The next drop-off will be on April 29th, and I think",194.16,3.37
the DEA will be putting out more information.,197.53,1.835
But when you see some of the action that was taking,199.365,3.37
"place in this report, it is truly a call to arms",202.735,3.17
for a crisis that is plaguing our country.,205.905,3.003
This afternoon the President will drop by the,208.908,2.369
Women&amp;#39;s Empowerment Panel that the White House,211.277,2.87
"is hosting, led by Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi,",214.147,4.337
"Education Secretary Betsy DeVos,",218.484,3.237
"Small Business Administrator Linda McMahon,",221.721,2.903
"U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley,",224.624,2.469
"Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Seema Verma,",227.093,4.137
who will all speak about the unique challenges that women,231.23,2.47
and young girls face today.,233.7,2.869
Vice President Pence and the First Lady will also,236.569,1.835
be in attendance.,238.404,1.302
The President is proud that his administration,239.706,2.535
is full of so many female leaders from who will,242.241,3.003
be on stage this afternoon to those incredibly -- their,245.244,2.737
"incredible work doesn&amp;#39;t always make headlines,",247.981,2.235
but it&amp;#39;s certainly felt across the federal government,250.216,1.969
and across our nation.,252.185,1.501
"Women&amp;#39;s History Month is coming to an end, but the",253.686,2.569
Trump administration is committed to empowering,256.255,1.902
women in the workplace.,258.157,1.635
The work that we started this month will not end,259.792,2.002
at the end of this month but will continue.,261.794,2.069
The President made women&amp;#39;s empowerment a priority,263.863,2.102
"throughout the campaign, speaking out on affordable",265.965,2.436
"childcare and paid family leave, investing in",268.401,2.703
"women&amp;#39;s health, and the barriers faced by female entrepreneurs",271.104,3.503
"and business owners. In February, he and Prime Minister Trudeau from",274.607,3.504
Canada launched the United States-Canada Council,278.111,3.036
for Advancement of Women Entrepreneurs.,281.147,2.469
This month the First Lady hosted an event,283.616,1.935
for International Women&amp;#39;s Day in the East Wing.,285.551,2.336
CMS Administrator Verma hosted a panel on women,287.887,3.57
in healthcare.,291.457,1.168
"His daughter, Ivanka, held a roundtable with women",292.625,2.136
"business owners with SBA Administrator McMahon,",294.761,2.802
as well as other -- roundtable with Latina,297.563,1.802
business owners.,299.365,1.568
"And just earlier today, the First Lady joined",300.933,1.402
"the Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs,",302.335,2.302
"Tom Shannon, to present the 2017 Secretary of State&amp;#39;s",304.637,3.637
International Women of Courage Award at the State Department.,308.274,3.57
"The President believes, as the First Lady said this",311.844,1.969
"morning, &amp;quot;Wherever women are diminished, the entire",313.813,2.803
world is diminished with them.,316.616,1.435
"However, wherever women are empowered, towns,",318.051,2.435
"villages, schools and economies are empowered,",320.486,2.636
"and together, we are all made stronger.&amp;quot;",323.122,2.603
The Trump administration will continue to work,325.725,1.802
to ensure that the American economy is a place where,327.527,2.469
women can work and thrive.,329.996,1.802
"Later this evening, the Vice President will",331.798,1.568
"participate in the swearing-in of David Friedman, as the next",333.366,3.503
ambassador to Israel.,336.869,1.969
The President is glad that Ambassador Friedman will,338.838,2.236
be officially on board as we strive for a lasting,341.074,2.102
peace in the Middle East.,343.176,2.669
Mr. Friedman&amp;#39;s strong relationships in Israel,345.845,1.768
will be a tremendous asset to the President,347.613,1.702
in furthering that mission.,349.315,2.035
"Finally, I want to speak about Judge Gorsuch",351.35,2.37
and the blatantly political obstruction of his nomination,353.72,3.57
to the Supreme Court,357.29,0.801
by Senate Democrats.,358.091,1.534
"Yesterday, the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said",359.625,2.503
that next Friday the Senate will vote to confirm Neil Gorsuch,362.128,3.003
to the Supreme Court.,365.131,1.335
We welcome this news.,366.466,1.501
"Unfortunately, Senate Democrats have begun",367.967,1.869
justifying their opposition to Judge,369.836,1.668
Gorsuch by claiming a 60-vote standard for his confirmation.,371.504,3.837
That standard doesn&amp;#39;t exist and these claims,375.341,2.002
continue to be false.,377.343,1.435
A party-line filibuster by the Senate minority,378.778,2.336
is not a fair up or down vote.,381.114,2.068
You don&amp;#39;t have to look further than the voices,383.182,1.602
"of many of these same Democrats to see why,",384.784,3.236
"in 2013, Senator Tom Udall said, and I quote in full,",388.02,3.07
&amp;quot;Some of us may disagree with Justice Scalia on,391.09,3.003
"judicial philosophy, but he was a qualified nominee.",394.093,2.97
He received an up or down vote and he was,397.063,1.768
unanimously confirmed.,398.831,1.602
"Likewise,&amp;quot; he said, &amp;quot;Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg",400.433,3.203
was considered a liberal.,403.636,1.001
"The former ACLU general counsel, many on the other side may",404.637,3.47
have disagreed with her views but there was no filibuster.,408.107,2.436
She was confirmed by a vote of 96 to 3.&amp;quot;,410.543,4.037
"He added, &amp;quot;A minority in the Senate should not",414.58,2.169
be able to block qualified nominees.&amp;quot;,416.749,2.87
We could not agree more with Senator Udall.,419.619,2.435
"Unfortunately, he has now adopted a new party line",422.054,2.369
of obstruction in blocking a fair up or down vote,424.423,2.336
on the confirmation of Judge Gorsuch.,426.759,1.435
It&amp;#39;s both sad and unfortunate.,428.194,2.603
And we encourage all senators from both parties,430.797,2.402
to fairly evaluate the judge&amp;#39;s eminent,433.199,2.002
qualifications and grant him an up or down vote.,435.201,2.603
"With that, be glad to take your questions.",437.804,2.569
April.,440.373,1.568
"The Press: Why thank you, Sean.",441.941,1.368
(laughter),443.309,1.068
Mr. Spicer: How are you today?,444.377,0.934
"The Press: I&amp;#39;m fine, and how are you?",445.311,1.034
Mr. Spicer: Fantastic.,446.345,1.035
(laughter),447.38,1.268
The Press: Great.,448.648,3.303
"Well, Sean, going back to some issues that are in",451.951,1.768
the news -- Nunes is not going to recuse himself.,453.719,4.271
"In the midst of all of this back-and-forth, what",457.99,2.87
does the White House say about that?,460.86,3.103
"Mr. Spicer: Well, April, the White House -- I think",463.963,3.537
I mentioned this yesterday.,467.5,2.135
He&amp;#39;s conducting an investigation.,469.635,1.835
He is the elected or appointed -- I can&amp;#39;t,471.47,2.503
"remember how they do over there, but appointed",473.973,4.137
and confirmed -- or however they -- but by his,478.11,2.47
colleagues in the House and the Speaker.,480.58,2.269
"He is the chairman, he&amp;#39;s conducting an investigation.",482.849,1.868
It is up to the House of Representatives,484.717,1.668
and the Speaker and the members of the House Republican,486.385,2.336
Conference to determine.,488.721,1.668
There is nothing that I see that is problematic,490.389,2.536
in him conducting an investigation that we asked,492.925,1.902
both the House and Senate Intelligence Committees.,494.827,2.469
The Press: What are the conversations,497.296,0.935
the President is having with Paul Ryan about this --,498.231,2.268
to include Dems and Republicans are talking,500.499,4.438
about what looks like impropriety in the intel,504.937,3.737
"chief&amp;#39;s handling of this so far, particularly",508.674,2.77
as there&amp;#39;s not a hearing right now?,511.444,2.936
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I would take issue with -- I think",514.38,4.037
you&amp;#39;re right that there may appear to be certain,518.417,2.303
"things, but I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s any actual proof",520.72,2.836
or sustaining allegation about anything that&amp;#39;s done.,523.556,3.036
Again -- I mentioned this yesterday -- if you look,526.592,2.469
"at what Chairman Nunes has done, he has met with",529.061,3.637
people who are cleared to discuss classified,532.698,2.036
information regarding a review that he is conducting.,534.734,3.336
That&amp;#39;s how it&amp;#39;s supposed to work.,538.07,1.602
"And again, I understand that when things are",539.672,3.503
leaked out in the media that somehow that is a,543.175,2.77
"standard that&amp;#39;s acceptable, but when",545.945,1.635
two people who are cleared to discuss classified,547.58,2.002
"information, or three, or however many, discuss",549.582,3.503
"classified information, somehow that&amp;#39;s wrong",553.085,2.436
because it&amp;#39;s not being leaked.,555.521,1.969
"He is conducting a review, which we have supported,",557.49,3.503
on both sides of the chambers.,560.993,1.802
And I think that they should do this.,562.795,1.969
But I think to start to prejudge where this thing,564.764,2.636
"is going -- we have been in support of, as you know",567.4,2.969
-- and I think that let&amp;#39;s let that process bear,570.369,2.77
itself out and see what happens.,573.139,2.002
I will tell you that I&amp;#39;ve seen reports in the media,575.141,2.969
that the NSA has documents that they are supposedly,578.11,5.105
trying to get to the House Intelligence Committee,583.215,2.903
that have been requested.,586.118,1.202
"We think that&amp;#39;s a great thing if that&amp;#39;s, in fact,",587.32,3.87
what&amp;#39;s happening.,591.19,1.001
"But again, I think part of this all gets back to that",592.191,1.435
there&amp;#39;s a process.,593.626,1.368
And I get that sometimes it&amp;#39;s frustrating to us.,594.994,2.002
I believe that we want this over as much,596.996,3.003
as I think some of you.,599.999,1.401
But we recognize that there&amp;#39;s a process that has,601.4,2.169
"to take place, and that process is taking place.",603.569,3.737
"The Chairman and the House Intelligence, and I know",607.306,2.002
that Senator Burr and Senator Warner are talking,609.308,1.935
"about the process that they&amp;#39;re going to go on,",611.243,1.368
on the Senate side.,612.611,1.035
Some of these things take a little bit of time.,613.646,2.069
And to the extent that they are gathering the,615.715,2.502
"appropriate documents and looking at those things,",618.217,2.302
then that&amp;#39;s part of the process and the review,620.519,2.002
"that is being undertaken, and we&amp;#39;re fine with that.",622.521,2.47
The Press: And second topic.,624.991,1.301
Tax reform and infrastructure -- reports are saying you&amp;#39;re going,626.292,2.502
to do it together.,628.794,1.502
"And ACA -- well, Obamacare, going into",630.296,3.67
"Trumpcare, at that time, tax reform",633.966,2.169
and infrastructure were said to be some of the reasons,636.135,1.935
why you did not come up in the budget with,638.07,2.97
eliminating the debt.,641.04,1.768
Do you have cost estimates as it relates to tax,642.808,4.104
reform and infrastructure as of yet.,646.912,1.535
"Mr. Spicer: No, because I think you need to have",648.447,2.336
plans laid out first.,650.783,1.702
And I think part of this is that we&amp;#39;re in the,652.485,1.935
beginning phases of both of those.,654.42,3.904
So to have a score on either one of them,658.324,2.769
or a cost when we don&amp;#39;t have those formalized yet --,661.093,3.27
and I think we&amp;#39;re in the beginning phases of having,664.363,2.336
"those discussions with both stakeholders, members",666.699,3.036
"of Congress on both sides, and obviously internally",669.735,3.037
the formulation of those plans is continuing.,672.772,2.869
"So until that happens, I don&amp;#39;t see us having",675.641,2.436
a formal cost or a score.,678.077,2.436
The Press: Do you trust CBO now?,680.513,0.967
Mr. Spicer: It&amp;#39;s not a question of trust.,681.48,1.936
"Remember, I want to be clear about what I&amp;#39;ve said",683.416,2.502
before -- I think when it comes to cost estimates,685.918,2.803
"and budget issues, which is what CBO is charged",688.721,3.203
"to do, they&amp;#39;re the Congressional Budget Office --",691.924,2.569
and while I think sometimes they&amp;#39;re a little off,694.493,1.569
"on that, that is what they&amp;#39;re charged with doing.",696.062,1.935
And I think there&amp;#39;s a score.,697.997,1.268
"Where I think -- it&amp;#39;s not a question of trust, it&amp;#39;s",699.265,2.702
a question of accuracy.,701.967,1.235
And I think that the issue that we previously brought,703.202,3.003
"up was when they had scored people and coverage,",706.205,3.77
"which isn&amp;#39;t necessarily their wheelhouse, they have been",709.975,2.47
way off.,712.445,1.067
"And again, I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a question of us",713.512,1.368
trusting or not.,714.88,1.502
"It&amp;#39;s literally a question of saying, they believe",716.382,2.069
that 26 million people would be on Obamacare;,718.451,3.036
"10.4 were, and falling.",721.487,2.035
I think that&amp;#39;s -- that&amp;#39;s not a question of whether,723.522,2.67
we trust them or not.,726.192,1.268
"It&amp;#39;s a question of -- those are the facts,",727.46,2.569
and those facts bear out that they were off by more than,730.029,2.302
50 percent when it came to counting people.,732.331,2.703
And I just want to be clear that it&amp;#39;s not a,735.034,2.202
question of whether we trust them or not.,737.236,1.368
I would ask whether that&amp;#39;s really what they&amp;#39;re,738.604,1.802
supposed to be doing.,740.406,1.468
Major.,741.874,1.602
"The Press: Sean, a couple of things that we talked",743.476,1.568
about on Monday.,745.044,0.967
"On Monday, you said to us from the podium you would",746.011,1.802
look into how Chairman Nunes was cleared to be,747.813,2.636
here and with whom he met.,750.449,2.036
Can you give us -- we tried to ask you that,752.485,1.635
yesterday as you walked out.,754.12,1.067
Do you have any information to live,755.187,1.769
up to the commitment you made here on Monday to provide,756.956,2.202
more details about how that happened in a process,759.158,3.27
you just told us yet again is above board,762.428,2.569
and totally appropriate?,764.997,1.568
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t have anything for you on that,766.565,2.169
at this time.,768.734,1.001
"But again, I don&amp;#39;t --",769.735,0.901
The Press: Have you looked into it?,770.636,1.101
Mr. Spicer: I have asked some preliminary questions.,771.737,1.535
I have not gotten answers yet.,773.272,1.735
"And I think there&amp;#39;s -- so, no, I don&amp;#39;t have anything",775.007,2.97
further on that.,777.977,0.934
"But, again, I would argue, Major -- it&amp;#39;s interesting",778.911,2.135
-- and I brought this up the other day -- that,781.046,1.302
there seems to be this fascination with the process.,782.348,2.202
It&amp;#39;s: How did he get here?,784.55,1.602
What door did he enter?,786.152,1.534
As opposed to what&amp;#39;s the substance of what we&amp;#39;re finding.,787.686,2.536
"When I get -- not from you, and I&amp;#39;m not trying to",790.222,2.069
be -- but so many times I get these calls that we,792.291,2.803
have an unnamed intel source that says the,795.094,1.902
"following substance occurred, do you admit",796.996,2.502
"it, do you deny it, whatever -- and we have this",799.498,1.769
argument over substance.,801.267,0.834
"In this case, the fascination is with",802.101,2.936
"what door did he come in, who did he meet with, how did",805.037,2.136
"he get WAVEd in, as opposed to what I think it",807.173,2.235
"should be, and, ironically, it&amp;#39;s not when it&amp;#39;s -- when the shoe",809.408,3.904
"is on the other foot, is what&amp;#39;s the substance.",813.312,1.268
"Just yesterday, just to be clear, we started this day",814.58,3.136
with The Washington Post falsely posting a story,817.716,2.736
saying the White House blocked Sally Yates.,820.452,3.037
"By the end of the day, it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;officials blocked",823.489,2.035
Sally Yates.&amp;quot;,825.524,1.001
They were wrong.,826.525,1.068
And they jumped to a conclusion based on,827.593,1.835
whatever unnamed sources.,829.428,1.635
And I think that what we&amp;#39;re trying to do,831.063,1.468
is argue that there should be a process.,832.531,2.302
The Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee,834.833,2.303
and others are going through a review.,837.136,1.435
We support that review.,838.571,1.901
"And so, as much as I understand that everyone",840.472,2.536
"wants to jump to how did everyone get in, what did",843.008,2.703
they do -- they&amp;#39;re undergoing an investigation.,845.711,2.402
The Press: I have a substantive question about that.,848.113,1.535
Mr. Spicer: Okay.,849.648,1.201
The Press: But I&amp;#39;m just asking you about something,850.849,1.001
you told us --,851.85,0.835
"Mr. Spicer: No, I said I would look into it.",852.685,1.201
The Press: Are you going to continue to look into this?,853.886,1.301
"Mr. Spicer: I will, I will look into it",855.187,1.101
and whether or not --,856.288,1.101
The Press: You&amp;#39;ll live up to that obligation to look into it?,857.389,1.502
Mr. Spicer: I will.,858.891,1.068
"But the obligation is I said I would look into it,",859.959,1.368
and I continue to do that.,861.327,1.134
The Press: Okay.,862.461,1.068
"So, you said yesterday about Sally Yates &amp;quot;show",863.529,1.568
what you know.&amp;quot;,865.097,1.034
"Well, one of the reasons that there&amp;#39;s this question",866.131,1.068
about Chairman Nunes is he hasn&amp;#39;t told his own,867.199,2.536
"committee members what he knows, how he learned",869.735,3.27
"about it, and what the substantive importance",873.005,2.903
of that is.,875.908,1.335
"So, we are also curious about that.",877.243,1.835
And among the things that might shed light on that,879.078,4.271
is how he got here and who he met with and what he learned.,883.349,2.202
Mr. Spicer: Right.,885.551,0.901
The Press: We&amp;#39;re trying to figure that out as well.,886.452,1.001
"Mr. Spicer: I understand, and I think those are",887.453,0.867
questions for him.,888.32,0.868
The Press: Don&amp;#39;t you want to know those things?,889.188,1.735
"Mr. Spicer: But I think that, Major, that there&amp;#39;s",890.923,1.868
"a slippery slope that we&amp;#39;re talking about here,",892.791,1.836
because if we start looking into certain,894.627,1.968
"things, then the accusation the next day",896.595,2.369
"is going to be, you looked into this, can you look",898.964,2.903
into that; why did you ask this person.,901.867,1.668
"I mean, a couple weeks ago, there were stories",903.535,3.137
about whether or not we called certain people,906.672,1.635
"and we did -- so we&amp;#39;re damned if we do, we&amp;#39;re damned if",908.307,2.369
"we don&amp;#39;t on this stuff -- because on the one hand,",910.676,2.502
"you want certain answers; on the other hand,",913.178,1.569
you want to talk about us being involved.,914.747,1.368
And I think we&amp;#39;ve tried to keep -- we asked for an,916.115,2.169
"investigation, and at the same time, we&amp;#39;ve tried to",918.284,2.435
make sure that we allow that review to go on that,920.719,3.804
-- both the House and the Senate Intelligence.,924.523,1.468
"So, we can&amp;#39;t cherry-pick every time that you decide",925.991,3.404
that a piece of information is relevant,929.395,2.168
to what you want.,931.563,1.235
I think that we know that they are undertaking,932.798,2.97
a review -- hold on.,935.768,1.434
"The Press: -- is going on, and the members of the",937.202,1.202
very committee themselves say they don&amp;#39;t know what,938.404,3.57
is being discussed.,941.974,1.068
Mr. Spicer: Fair enough.,943.042,0.9
Right.,943.942,0.901
The Press: How is the process going forward?,944.843,1.035
How is that a workable process?,945.878,1.101
"Mr. Spicer: But what I&amp;#39;m saying is, the answer to",946.979,1.301
"that question is, that is a question for Chairman Nunes.",948.28,1.969
I don&amp;#39;t have any authority over how the House,950.249,2.836
Intelligence Committee conducts itself.,953.085,1.768
That&amp;#39;s a question -- The Press: You have authority,954.853,1.802
about whether he gets into this building and can,956.655,2.236
review secured information on this site.,958.891,1.334
Mr. Spicer: But how he conducts himself with his,960.225,1.402
"members, when and where he shares things, et cetera,",961.627,2.803
are issues for him and the committee and the House of,964.43,2.335
"Representatives, not for us.",966.765,1.769
"That&amp;#39;s it, plain and simple.",968.534,1.001
John.,969.535,1.902
"The Press: Sean, we know that members of the House",971.437,1.001
"Freedom Caucus the Tuesday Group, Republican study",972.438,2.502
group are up on the Hill trying to see if they can,974.94,2.703
come to some sort of an agreement to find a way,977.643,1.902
forward on healthcare.,979.545,0.967
How real does the White House think this,980.512,3.07
possibility of resurrecting healthcare is?,983.582,2.202
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think the President, from the",985.784,4.271
"early days of his campaign, talked about",990.055,2.303
repealing and replacing it.,992.358,1.101
It&amp;#39;s a commitment that he made.,993.459,1.501
I think he&amp;#39;d like to get it done.,994.96,2.77
But he also understands -- and I don&amp;#39;t want to be --,997.73,3.536
I&amp;#39;m going to be completely consistent with two things.,1001.266,1.602
"One is, he understands that in order to get",1002.868,2.803
"to 216, we have to make sure that it does what he says",1005.671,3.503
it was going to do -- that it achieves those goals,1009.174,2.97
of lowering cost and creating more options.,1012.144,2.402
"And so, we&amp;#39;re not going create a deal for the sake",1014.546,2.837
of creating a deal that ends up being not,1017.383,2.402
in the best interest of the American people.,1019.785,1.468
You got to know when to walk away from a deal that,1021.253,2.269
is going to end up bad.,1023.522,2.202
And he wants to have a good deal.,1025.724,1.468
And so the deal that he&amp;#39;s looking for is willing to,1027.192,1.936
"have members come and talk to him, and engage on this",1029.128,6.406
"whole area and figure out what it would take, what",1035.534,2.069
"their ideas are to get there, to grow that vote.",1037.603,2.202
And if they can do that and get to an area where,1039.805,2.369
we will have a majority of the House and can move it,1042.174,2.169
"to the Senate, then we&amp;#39;re going to engage in that.",1044.343,2.135
What we&amp;#39;ve seen members of both sides of the aisle,1046.478,3.237
engage with the White House on ways that are,1049.715,3.47
potentially -- ways to get there.,1053.185,2.703
"And so it&amp;#39;s a conversation, and we&amp;#39;re",1055.888,1.835
not trying to jam that down anyone&amp;#39;s throat right now.,1057.723,3.47
It&amp;#39;s an ongoing discussion.,1061.193,1.802
The Press: Does the White House share the,1062.995,1.334
frustration of many Republicans in Capitol Hill,1064.329,2.036
and the sentiments that the House Freedom Caucus,1066.365,2.102
&amp;quot;botched&amp;quot; this?,1068.467,0.867
Mr. Spicer: I think the President&amp;#39;s comments,1069.334,4.071
on this speak for themselves.,1073.405,1.168
"The Press: I just have one more, and on the same thing.",1074.573,3.57
The President and members of the White House have,1078.143,2.202
suggested that maybe we can get some Democrats,1080.345,2.303
onboard on healthcare reform.,1082.648,2.369
"The fact that no Democrat, not one Democrat supported",1085.017,3.537
"the last attempt, and given the desires of the",1088.554,3.904
"Freedom Caucus versus what the Democrats were doing,",1092.458,3.003
it is reasonable to think that even one Democrat,1095.461,3.003
would come onboard this?,1098.464,1.334
Mr. Spicer: No.,1099.798,0.934
"I mean, I think it is not unreasonable to -- The",1100.732,3.637
"Press: No, I said, is it reasonable.",1104.369,2.937
Mr. Spicer: I think it depends on how they want,1107.306,1.768
to get there.,1109.074,1.402
"Again, there&amp;#39;s a balancing act.",1110.476,1.267
It&amp;#39;s not about just picking up one;,1111.743,1.335
it&amp;#39;s picking up enough to get to 216.,1113.078,1.969
"And it&amp;#39;s, what does that take without compromising",1115.047,2.736
the principles that you want to achieve.,1117.783,3.637
So is it possible -- sure -- that there&amp;#39;s a handful,1121.42,2.502
"or so, or maybe more Democrats that are willing to engage.",1123.922,2.903
But it&amp;#39;s worth the conversation.,1126.825,1.735
But again -- The Press: Isn&amp;#39;t this kind of a,1128.56,1.969
"Boehner tactic, to say, okay, if you&amp;#39;re not going",1130.529,1.501
"to work with us, House Freedom Caucus,",1132.03,1.669
we&amp;#39;re going to go to the Democrats?,1133.699,1.301
"Mr. Spicer: No, it&amp;#39;s a tactic to get to --",1135,1.001
"I mean, it&amp;#39;s a math tactic.",1136.001,2.069
"It&amp;#39;s how do you get to 216, in this case.",1138.07,3.303
And it&amp;#39;s engage with whoever will get you to that number.,1141.373,3.036
"Now, as I mentioned yesterday, I mean, over",1144.409,1.802
"the course of 17 months, Obamacare failed",1146.211,3.871
and started multiple times; it went off on multiple,1150.082,2.702
"different tracks, including single payer,",1152.784,1.936
"until it finally came back, and ultimately, upon",1154.72,2.536
"Scott Brown&amp;#39;s election, they jammed it through and",1157.256,2.736
did it so quick to make sure,1159.992,1.101
that the Secretary of Human Services -- but I get it.,1161.093,2.602
"And so we&amp;#39;re 20 days, 21 days into this process,",1163.695,3.37
22 probably today.,1167.065,1.135
So we&amp;#39;ll see.,1168.2,2.669
But I think the idea that the President has put out,1170.869,2.503
there is that if people want to float ideas and suggestions,1173.372,3.87
"on how we can grow this vote and get to a majority,",1177.242,2.269
he&amp;#39;ll entertain them.,1179.511,1.168
Tamara.,1180.679,1.134
The Press: Thank you.,1181.813,0.901
I have sort of a lightning round about opioids.,1182.714,4.371
Is a commission being created?,1187.085,1.769
Is Chris Christie the head of that commission?,1188.854,1.702
"He was sort of talking about it, but I haven&amp;#39;t",1190.556,1.401
seen anything on it.,1191.957,1.168
And what sort of timeline will that commission have,1193.125,2.836
in terms of presenting findings?,1195.961,2.002
What&amp;#39;s the goal of this thing?,1197.963,1.435
"Mr. Spicer: Well, there&amp;#39;s -- I mean, I think it&amp;#39;s",1199.398,1.902
easier to start with the goal.,1201.3,1.067
I think if you see the roundtable -- and I know,1202.367,2.603
the pool will have a readout of this afterwards,1204.97,2.235
-- the goal is to figure out -- I think Governor,1207.205,1.635
Christie has been a leader of this in New Jersey.,1208.84,1.602
It&amp;#39;s an issue that plagues countless communities,1210.442,4.071
more and more.,1214.513,4.471
And so whether it&amp;#39;s New Hampshire or other places,1218.984,2.369
"in the Midwest, it&amp;#39;s sitting there and figuring",1221.353,2.703
"out best practices and how can we get it down,",1224.056,2.802
and how can we provide the treatment.,1226.858,2.069
"I mean, I think the DEA Administrator was noting",1228.927,3.871
in the discussion that we&amp;#39;ve gotten really good,1232.798,2.135
at law enforcement.,1234.933,1.669
"But the question is, how do we focus on the treatment,",1236.602,1.735
"how do we focus on the prevention,",1238.337,1.735
how do we look at things that happened in the past to,1240.072,4.404
deter drug addiction from starting in the first,1244.476,2.035
"place, and to deter young people in particular from",1246.511,2.269
"starting with drugs, to now, how do we help",1248.78,2.436
families cope with this?,1251.216,1.101
There&amp;#39;s a lot of it.,1252.317,1.068
"So, I think today is the first step of bringing some",1253.385,3.07
of these stakeholders together.,1256.455,3.069
"But like I just mentioned on the other thing,",1259.524,1.502
"I appreciate that everyone wants the answers, but I",1261.026,3.67
think that there&amp;#39;s a reason that you&amp;#39;re looking,1264.696,3.137
at this as two things -- a whole of government,1267.833,2.469
"and a whole of person, right?",1270.302,1.401
"It&amp;#39;s looking at, how do we look at people to help",1271.703,4.872
"them get the recovery, stay clean, not start",1276.575,2.569
"in the first place, help them get into treatment",1279.144,3.203
"centers, help them get a job afterwards.",1282.347,2.269
"I mean, there&amp;#39;s a lot of whole of person, but then",1284.616,2.102
there&amp;#39;s a whole of government.,1286.718,1.168
"As I mentioned, I mean, you&amp;#39;re looking at --",1287.886,1.468
around that table today you&amp;#39;ve got families and,1289.354,3.037
parents and individuals who have been personally,1292.391,2.269
"affected in one way, shape, or form.",1294.66,1.334
You&amp;#39;ve got Governor Christie who&amp;#39;s dealt with,1295.994,1.335
it at a state level.,1297.329,1.435
You got Pam Bondi who&amp;#39;s looked at it from a state level.,1298.764,2.435
You&amp;#39;ve got Secretary Kelly who&amp;#39;s looking at it from,1301.199,1.535
"Homeland Security; DEA, who&amp;#39;s looking at partially",1302.734,2.369
from law enforcement.,1305.103,1.302
"Then you&amp;#39;ve also got Secretary DeVos,",1306.405,2.469
who&amp;#39;s looking at it from education and prevention.,1308.874,1.902
"And it is a big, big issue that is plaguing our",1310.776,3.169
"country, plaguing our communities, and plaguing",1313.945,1.602
our families.,1315.547,1.034
And so I wish I could give you an answer and say this,1316.581,1.802
is how we&amp;#39;re going to solve the problem.,1318.383,1.902
But I think the first step is understanding,1320.285,2.169
"the problem, the magnitude of it, and looking at",1322.454,2.169
how we approach it holistically.,1324.623,2.369
The Press: Two very short ones.,1326.992,1.168
The timeline for them coming back with findings.,1328.16,3.403
"And then, the President, when he was campaigning,",1331.563,3.203
"seemed to endorse the STOP Act, which would prevent",1334.766,3.17
fentanyl from being imported -- help to,1337.936,2.569
prevent fentanyl from being imported from,1340.505,1.635
countries like China.,1342.14,1.535
Would he use his presidential bully pulpit,1343.675,4.271
"to sort of push for that legislation now, which has",1347.946,2.102
not really gotten off the ground yet over in the conference?,1350.048,2.736
Mr. Spicer: That was one of the -- not the specific,1352.784,2.269
"piece of legislation, not the STOP Act in particular,",1355.053,1.702
but I think there was a lot of discussion about fentanyl,1356.755,1.802
and the rise of it today.,1358.557,2.369
And I think the Attorney General brought that up,1360.926,1.868
and was talking about the escalation of that,1362.794,1.635
from the 1980s to now.,1364.429,1.635
And so there is a look at it.,1366.064,2.569
"But again, as I mentioned, you&amp;#39;ve got",1368.633,2.536
"the Attorney General there, law enforcement, education.",1371.169,2.436
Part of this is to really look at this and figure,1373.605,2.136
out what are the ways that we can address it from,1375.741,3.069
coming into the country.,1378.81,1.135
"And the DEA Administrator was talking about it,",1379.945,2.068
especially the flow from the southern border.,1382.013,2.069
But then you look at it from a law enforcement,1384.082,1.535
"issue, a prevention issue and a treatment issue.",1385.617,1.768
And this is a -- I wish I could give you a really,1387.385,2.37
easy answer and say here is the silver bullet,1389.755,1.901
that&amp;#39;s going to stop this.,1391.656,1.168
But we recognize the growth of this problem and,1392.824,2.436

"And he also said in the end, and is quoted on page",1430.829,2.836
"one of The Financial Times, that the President does not know",1433.665,3.937
a lot about Europe.,1437.602,1.669
What is the President&amp;#39;s response to that?,1439.271,2.269
"Mr. Spicer: To Brexit, in particular?",1441.54,1.401
Or to --,1442.941,0.968
The Press: To the comments by President Juncker of,1443.909,2.068
the European Commission on Brexit?,1445.977,1.836
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think the President is very well",1447.813,1.868

all of the issues.,1452.35,0.968
"He was a leader in the effort to call Brexit, as you know.",1453.318,2.703
"And obviously, with respect to that, we",1456.021,2.569
respect the will of the British electorate,1458.59,1.868

"The Press: Sean, thank you.",1480.045,1.168
"I have two questions, or topics.",1481.213,2.235
But just the first: What&amp;#39;s the White House reaction,1483.448,1.402
to the shooting today at the Capitol?,1484.85,3.937
"Mr. Spicer: Well, it sounds like a very",1488.787,1.735
troubled individual.,1490.522,1.535
"Obviously, I&amp;#39;ll let law enforcement read that out,",1492.057,2.435

"understand, and what I have seen, it sounds like",1497.796,1.935
a very troubling instance.,1499.731,1.068
"I think -- again, I don&amp;#39;t want to get ahead of this,",1500.799,2.135
but it looks like law enforcement --,1502.934,1.402
I appreciate the efforts that the Capitol Police,1504.336,2.435
and others took.,1506.771,1.268
"I mean, you literally watched people put their",1508.039,1.936
lives in harm&amp;#39;s way today to protect tourists,1509.975,5.238
and other citizens.,1515.213,1.301
"And so, I want to commend the work of the Capitol Police",1516.514,2.636
and the work of law enforcement to continue,1519.15,3.17
to protect us.,1522.32,1.035
"At this time, when Washington is in its",1523.355,2.068
"glory, with the cherry blossoms out, and so many",1525.423,1.802

and the House of Representatives,1529.995,2.602
"and the Senate, and walk around Washington, D.C.,",1532.597,2.636
it&amp;#39;s reassuring to know that so many brave men and women,1535.233,2.836
are willing to put their lives on the line,1538.069,1.502
to make sure that the city stays safe.,1539.571,1.635
"The Press: A second topic -- last weekend,",1541.206,2.035
"the President spent the weekend here, not in Mar-a-Lago.",1543.241,3.937
"I&amp;#39;m wondering, was that in any way in response",1547.178,2.136
to some of the pushback he&amp;#39;s received about the cost,1549.314,2.603
associated with those trips.,1551.917,1.701
And part two of that -- does he plan to be here,1553.618,2.236
again this weekend?,1555.854,1.535
"Mr. Spicer: So, no.",1557.389,0.967
Yes.,1558.356,1.368
(laughter),1559.724,1.168
He will -- the President wanted,1560.892,1.435
to be here last weekend.,1562.327,0.968
He wants to be here this weekend.,1563.295,1.368
"He&amp;#39;ll be here, and then I will have updates on where",1564.663,3.436
he&amp;#39;ll be going forward.,1568.099,1.101

President Trump is reportedly expected,1574.572,1.435
to sign legislation that would allow Internet,1576.007,2.636
service providers to monitor Internet activity,1578.643,2.436
and sell that information without users&amp;#39; permission.,1581.079,3.103
Will he be signing that legislation?,1584.182,1.769
And why does think it&amp;#39;s good for America?,1585.951,2.135
I&amp;#39;m wondering who this benefits apart from ISPs,1588.086,2.669
and their executives.,1590.755,1.435
Mr. Spicer: The House and the Senate have just passed that.,1592.19,1.735
"When they enroll it, then we&amp;#39;ll have further updates on that.",1593.925,3.103
I&amp;#39;m not -- when we have -- I know that -- I believe,1597.028,3.07
we a statement of administration policy,1600.098,1.535
"on that bill out, and when we have further updates",1601.633,2.669

create major risks for people to use that,1608.773,2.836
information for nefarious purposes?,1611.609,1.869
Also hostile nations potentially looking,1613.478,2.402
at what congressmen are browsing online --,1615.88,2.503
is that concerning to the White House?,1618.383,2.202
"Mr. Spicer: I think there&amp;#39;s -- as I mentioned,",1620.585,1.969
that we have a statement of administration policy,1622.554,1.635
"on that bill, that we will have further updates,",1624.189,2.869
"and when we do -- we sign, I&amp;#39;m sure we&amp;#39;ll have further",1627.058,2.069
details on why.,1629.127,1.101
Zeke.,1630.228,1.135
The Press: I&amp;#39;ve got two questions on two topics for you.,1631.363,1.868
The commander of CENTCOM was up on the Hill earlier,1633.231,1.568
today and testified that the U.S. government believes,1634.799,4.004
that Russia has been supplying material (inaudible.),1638.803,3.837
I was wondering if the White House has any response,1642.64,2.336
"to that testimony, and does it believe that that&amp;#39;s",1644.976,1.435
a constructive effort.,1646.411,1.201
"Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sorry, who was testifying?",1647.612,1.268
The Press: The commander of CENTCOM.,1648.88,1.168
Is that a constructive effort on the part,1650.048,2.469
of the Russian government in that region?,1652.517,2.002
Mr. Spicer: I know there is several entities,1654.519,3.837
"looking into this, and I&amp;#39;m not going to -- I will say",1658.356,3.003
that DOD&amp;#39;s response speaks for itself.,1661.359,2.403
We understand the intelligence on this.,1663.762,3.136
The President has been briefed on it.,1666.898,1.635
"So, I&amp;#39;m not really sure what specifically you&amp;#39;re --",1668.533,2.336
The Press: -- on the action of the Russians right now.,1670.869,3.403
Mr. Spicer: I think the commander -- the CENTCOM,1674.272,1.702
commander&amp;#39;s testimony speaks for itself on that.,1675.974,3.036
The Press: And a second topic for you: About a,1679.01,2.469
"month from now, the government will run out",1681.479,2.102
"of money without another CR, as I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;re aware.",1683.581,3.204
"The President talked a lot about it in the campaign,",1686.785,1.501
and in his budget request funding for a border wall,1688.286,3.07
on the southern border with Mexico.,1691.356,1.835
Is that a deal-breaker for the President in any sort,1693.191,3.036
of government funding measure in the next month or so?,1696.227,4.638
"Mr. Spicer: So on April 29th, the CR expires --",1700.865,2.836
the continuing resolution -- and we are going to be,1703.701,2.77
working with Congress on that -- on the FY17 budget,1706.471,5.606
that needs to go forward.,1712.077,1.201
I know Director Mulvaney has talked about that.,1713.278,1.902
I&amp;#39;m not going to get into the specific details.,1715.18,1.635
"I know that, if you saw the budget they put out,",1716.815,2.535
I think it&amp;#39;s $1.6 billion or $1.7 billion that he&amp;#39;s,1719.35,2.837
initially put in the FY17 for the beginning of that,1722.187,2.936
"wall, and there&amp;#39;s $2.5, $2.6 --",1725.123,1.802
The Press: $1.6 billion is in there --,1726.925,1.701
"Mr. Spicer: Again, I think that is our request, and we will",1728.626,2.837
continue to work with Congress on how to move forward,1731.463,2.836
with the rest of fiscal year 17&amp;#39;s budget.,1734.299,2.235
Blake.,1736.534,1.302
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1737.836,0.834
A couple on healthcare.,1738.67,2.602
"The President here, last night, speaking to senators, said --",1741.272,2.903
quoting here -- &amp;quot;I know that we&amp;#39;re all going to make a deal,1744.175,2.436
on healthcare -- that&amp;#39;s such an easy one I have no doubt that,1746.611,3.37
that&amp;#39;s going to happen very quickly.&amp;quot;,1749.981,2.069
"What is the renewed sense of optimism, and what",1752.05,2.202
exactly is &amp;quot;very quickly&amp;quot;?,1754.252,0.968
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think there&amp;#39;s a little bit of",1755.22,2.736
sound that needs to go with that.,1757.956,1.334
I think he was having a little bit of fun with,1759.29,1.669
some previous comments that were made with,1760.959,2.369
respect to how easy it would be to get healthcare.,1763.328,1.802
So -- but there is a renewed sense because,1765.13,3.436
I think the comments and the calls that the President,1768.566,4.838
"has gotten, as well as the Vice President and other",1773.404,2.236
members of the senior team that have come in and,1775.64,2.236
"said, we believe that there is a path forward,",1777.876,2.302
"we have some ideas, and we&amp;#39;d like to talk",1780.178,1.335
to you about that.,1781.513,1.134
I know I&amp;#39;ve seen some of the reports that have been,1782.647,1.768
put out regarding some of the individual members of,1784.415,3.204
the Senate and the House that have been up here,1787.619,1.968
"meeting with our team, and I think there is a lot of",1789.587,1.969
"people who have some ideas about how to move forward,",1791.556,4.304
and we&amp;#39;re entertaining those.,1795.86,0.901
"But I think the interesting thing is,",1796.761,1.869
"is that despite the setback that we got last Friday,",1798.63,4.905
I think there is a renewed willingness from a lot of,1803.535,1.901
members who made commitments to the American people,1805.436,2.336
"and to their voters that they want to see this done,",1807.772,3.67
and they understand that not getting this done means,1811.442,2.369
"that -- as I said, and the President echoed when",1813.811,2.103
he went up to the House Republican Conference --,1815.914,1.401
is there&amp;#39;s going to be a consequence for this.,1817.315,1.935
People need to be taken at their word.,1819.25,1.769
There&amp;#39;s a lot of members that made a commitment,1821.019,2.169
"to their voters, to their constituents that they",1823.188,3.77
were going to get something done on this,1826.958,1.335
and repeal and replace and address the healthcare,1828.293,1.635
"situation, and that hasn&amp;#39;t gotten done.",1829.928,1.501
And I think that&amp;#39;s a concern for them.,1831.429,2.836
The Press: And let me ask you real quickly --,1834.265,1.535
you say that you embrace the House Intelligence Committee,1835.8,3.37
review of all of this.,1839.17,2.636
John McCain said earlier today that because of,1841.806,3.17
"the potential schism within that committee, that there",1844.976,2.569
should be a select committee that goes from this.,1847.545,2.836
"Would you embrace that if that happens, and what",1850.381,1.936
would your response --,1852.317,2.102
"Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t -- again, and I&amp;#39;m not going to get into",1854.419,1.434
"House and Senate matters, but I don&amp;#39;t -- as I mentioned",1855.853,2.536
"at the outset to April, I believe that people --",1858.389,3.237
"look, all that is -- how they conduct themselves",1861.626,2.169
internally is up to them.,1863.795,0.901
That&amp;#39;s obviously not for us to decide.,1864.696,2.235
But I think the question that I still think is,1866.931,2.102
outstanding is that what has happened is a review,1869.033,2.87
was called for that -- part of it was already,1871.903,1.668
"ongoing, from I understand, especially on the House side.",1873.571,3.203
And the chairman of that committee has gone,1876.774,2.002
and sought information and individuals who believed,1878.776,3.804
that information to further the review.,1882.58,2.436
I&amp;#39;m really not sure how that&amp;#39;s anything other than,1885.016,3.27
"what you&amp;#39;re supposed to do, and I think that is",1888.286,1.935
consistent what he has talked about.,1890.221,1.335
Dave Boyer.,1891.556,1.334
"The Press: Sean, thanks.",1892.89,1.068
Two questions.,1893.958,1.635
You mentioned Senator Udall opposing the Gorsuch nomination.,1895.593,3.437
He was here at the party last night.,1899.03,2.069
"Did the President try to work with the room, with",1901.099,1.968
"him and other Democrats, about the nomination last night?",1903.067,1.602
Mr. Spicer: I know he and the First Lady and others,1904.669,2.636
spoke to a variety of senators.,1907.305,1.568
I&amp;#39;m not -- I wasn&amp;#39;t keeping tabs on everybody,1908.873,2.469
"that he spoke to, but I do know that he had an",1911.342,2.403
"opportunity to speak to a lot of different senators,",1913.745,2.869
and he&amp;#39;s talked to a lot on the phone.,1916.614,1.702
So I don&amp;#39;t know about Senator Udall himself.,1918.316,2.469
"The Press: And secondly, two-thirds of the Democratic",1920.785,4.137
senators did not attend the party last night.,1924.922,2.536
Did that disappoint the President?,1927.458,3.304
Mr. Spicer: I think we were excited to see,1930.762,1.034
the one-third that did.,1931.796,0.901
"I know Senator Schumer was there, Senator Durbin.",1932.697,2.169
There were a lot of folks.,1934.866,1.635
"And again, I think that -- I&amp;#39;m sure the President",1936.501,4.271
will continue to do things like this.,1940.772,1.501
It was an amazing opportunity to have,1942.273,2.302
a moment sort of free of politics and to enjoy,1944.575,4.071
"some collegial moments with each other in the White House,",1948.646,6.306
and listen to the United States and Marine Corps bands play,1954.952,1.335
some amazing music and bring people together.,1956.287,3.07
And I think the President has talked about this.,1959.357,1.902
"You know, he&amp;#39;s mentioned this a bunch of times that",1961.259,1.635
there used to be a time when you could sit down,1962.894,2.169
"and share a meal together, go -- and I think that&amp;#39;s",1965.063,3.003
"what he&amp;#39;s been trying to do, is bring groups back",1968.066,2.002
"in, and at least just have a conversation and get to",1970.068,3.136
that human side a little bit.,1973.204,1.168
"And so yesterday was a good start, I think.",1974.372,2.97
Jonathan.,1977.342,1.001
"The Press: Sean, the President&amp;#39;s got in his",1978.343,2.068
"inbox a letter from Senate Democrats, and they say --",1980.411,4.672
the Democrats say they are ready and willing to work,1985.083,2.035
"with the President on improving Obamacare, they",1987.118,2.302
just have a couple of conditions.,1989.42,1.402
"First, the President has to abandon his effort to",1990.822,2.335
completely repeal the law and rescind the executive order.,1993.157,3.537
This letter is signed by the vast majority,1996.694,1.902
of the Democrats in the U.S. Senate.,1998.596,1.535
What does the President say?,2000.131,2.302
"Mr. Spicer: I think, as the President has noted,",2002.433,2.403
we&amp;#39;re willing to engage with people.,2004.836,1.368
I think they understand his principles.,2006.204,3.57
We need to repeal the law and replace it with,2009.774,2.703
something better.,2012.477,0.901
I understand what --,2013.378,1.001
The Press: But they&amp;#39;re saying,2014.379,1.167
they want to take full repeal off the table.,2015.546,1.268
Mr. Spicer: I understand what they -- I&amp;#39;ve seen,2016.814,1.101
parts of the letter and I know that 40 of them -- saw that.,2017.915,2.136
And I think what we need to do is figure out who,2020.051,2.302
wants to engage in a constructive conversation.,2022.353,3.137
"I understand what they want, but again, it&amp;#39;s not",2025.49,2.502
just a one-way street.,2027.992,1.235
I think the President has made very clear what,2029.227,1.601
he wants to do.,2030.828,1.235
And I think to the extent that some of them want to,2032.063,1.601
"have a conversation, we have a 52-seat majority",2033.664,2.369
in the Senate.,2036.033,1.302
If there are individuals in there that want,2037.335,1.668
to have a constructive conversation achieving,2039.003,1.502
"the goals, we can do it.",2040.505,1.334
But I think they also need to understand,2041.839,2.503
the President&amp;#39;s red lines.,2044.342,1.435
"The Press: But they say, as a first step, they want",2045.777,1.701
him to repeal that executive order.,2047.478,1.435
Is that something he is willing to do?,2048.913,1.401
Mr. Spicer: I think the President is committed to,2050.314,1.502
making sure that he continues to go down the,2051.816,1.001
"path that he&amp;#39;s gone down, and there are ways that,",2052.817,2.102
"if they want to join him, that they can.",2054.919,2.202
And I think there are some areas that they may want,2057.121,2.002
to engage with him on that we&amp;#39;ve seen so far.,2059.123,2.936
"And so, look, I understand they have a right to put",2062.059,2.37
out a letter and draw their lines in the sand.,2064.429,2.135
But I think the President is committed to doing --,2066.564,2.135
going down the path he is.,2068.699,1.168
And obviously first step is to get to 216 in the,2069.867,3.17
"House, and then address the concerns in the Senate.",2073.037,3.07
But he has continued to have conversations with,2076.107,1.968
"the Senate, and I think that, as Obamacare",2078.075,2.97
continues to struggle -- which it is --,2081.045,2.136
the premiums continue to go up and up -- I think,2083.181,2.035
the question is will those 40 people understand that,2085.216,3.37
they are the ones who are going to be responsible,2088.586,2.236
for owning the current policies that are making,2090.822,3.57
so many Americans struggle?,2094.392,1.802
Jim.,2096.194,1.001
"The Press: But just to clarify, was he joking",2097.195,1.167
when he said that making a deal on healthcare would,2098.362,1.502
be an easy one?,2099.864,1.468
"Mr. Spicer: I think if you watch the tape, it was a",2101.332,2.503
"light-hearted moment, Jonathan.",2103.835,1.301
And so he was having a little --,2105.136,2.235
The Press: He doesn&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s easy to --,2107.371,0.935
"Mr. Spicer: No, he was -- no.",2108.306,1.434
Watch -- he was having a fun time with the senators there.,2109.74,3.003
Jim.,2112.743,1.302
The Press: The other thing that the President said,2114.045,1.001
last night was our soldiers are fighting,2115.046,2.536
like never before in Iraq.,2117.582,1.868
"But as you know, Sean, U.S. troops there are in a support",2119.45,5.072
role -- an advise-and-assist role.,2124.522,2.636
What does he mean?,2127.158,1.301
What does the President mean when he says they&amp;#39;re,2128.459,1.468
"fighting there like never before, obviously --",2129.927,1.502
Mr. Spicer: I think --,2131.429,1.001
The Press: -- that doesn&amp;#39;t take into consideration,2132.43,1.668
what happened during the Bush administration,2134.098,1.235
and the Obama administration --,2135.333,1.301
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, no, I appreciate --",2136.634,0.834
The Press: -- fighting house to house.,2137.468,1.001
"Mr. Spicer: Yes, I think that there has been some",2138.469,1.835
"progress, particularly in Mosul, the way that they",2140.304,2.503
have taken back that city.,2142.807,1.034
And I think that for a long time there was a lot,2143.841,3.837
of concern about Iran moving in and dominating,2147.678,3.637
parts of Iraq.,2151.315,1.068
And I think with the advice and consent of U.S. military,2152.383,3.77
"advisors, there&amp;#39;s been tremendous progress",2156.153,2.37
in moving Iraq forward to an area of civility,2158.523,4.671
and to continuing to see the troops there in Iraq,2163.194,3.537
stand on their own.,2166.731,1.568
And I think that he is very pleased with the,2168.299,2.102
action that General Mattis and our soldiers and,2170.401,2.736
"sailors, airmen, and Marines are taking to do that.",2173.137,3.103
The Press: I was going to follow up.,2176.24,1.402
If you couple that comment with the comment on,2177.642,2.836
"healthcare, it being the easy one to get that done,",2180.478,2.469
it just -- it sounds like -- probably have heard,2182.947,2.669
this and come across this notion that he&amp;#39;s just,2185.616,1.802
detached from reality in making those comments.,2187.418,1.768
"Mr. Spicer: First of all, I think that -- I again",2189.186,4.372
would respectfully ask you that you review the tape.,2193.558,1.868
He was having a light-hearted moment.,2195.426,2.002
It&amp;#39;s on tape.,2197.428,0.801
Everybody watched it.,2198.229,0.767
He was poking fun and making a joke.,2198.996,1.602
There&amp;#39;s been comments before about how he didn&amp;#39;t,2200.598,2.736
"get it, and he was joking about how easy it was, okay?",2203.334,3.07
It was a light-hearted moment.,2206.404,1.768
It was on tape.,2208.172,1.235
I think everybody -- and the idea that there&amp;#39;s this,2209.407,2.002
-- like you&amp;#39;re trying to make it look like he was,2211.409,2.435
being utterly serious at the time is a little bit,2213.844,2.47
of a stretch.,2216.314,1.434
The Press: And one quick thing on Chairman Nunes.,2217.748,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: But I think -- just so we&amp;#39;re clear, I&amp;#39;m sorry,",2219.083,1.902
just to end there -- that he was very proud of the work,2220.985,2.336
that our soldiers and sailors are doing over there in Iraq.,2223.321,5.338
There is a lot of work and a lot of progress that is,2228.659,1.835
being made in the updates that he&amp;#39;s getting from,2230.494,1.502
General Mattis on a daily basis.,2231.996,1.935
"The Press: But he doesn&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re in combat,",2233.931,1.301
they&amp;#39;re engaged in combat?,2235.232,1.035
"Mr. Spicer: No, no.",2236.267,1.335
"But, again, I think the progress that&amp;#39;s being made",2237.602,1.634
in Iraq and that the fight against ISIS is going extremely,2239.236,3.07
well -- and he&amp;#39;s proud of it.,2242.306,1.735
The Press: And I was just going to ask you very quickly,2244.041,0.734
on Chairman Nunes.,2244.775,1.068
Do you personally know who the source of Chairman,2245.843,3.937
Nunes&amp;#39;s information is?,2249.78,1.569
"Mr. Spicer: No, I do not.",2251.349,1.167
Jeff Mason.,2252.516,1.268
"The Press: Sean, one on both -- on two topics.",2253.784,1.735
First on healthcare.,2255.519,1.035
Does the President want to start a new healthcare,2256.554,2.402
bill or tweak the one that did not go last week?,2258.956,2.403
Mr. Spicer: I think we&amp;#39;re starting with where we are,2261.359,2.535
and trying to move that forward.,2263.894,1.335
I think that is the current vessel.,2265.229,1.602
The Press: And on a separate topic.,2266.831,1.935
The President did not mention the Paris Agreement,2268.766,2.402
yesterday when he went to the EPA.,2271.168,2.169
Can you update us on his current thinking about that?,2273.337,2.102
Does he want the United States to stay in?,2275.439,2.469
"And if he does, how does he expect the United States",2277.908,3.37
to meet its commitments without,2281.278,1.535
the Clean Power Plan?,2282.813,1.402
Mr. Spicer: I think the Paris agreement is still,2284.215,1.501
under discussion within the administration.,2285.716,1.835
The Press: Do you have a deadline on when you&amp;#39;ll know?,2287.551,1.702
Mr. Spicer: I can try to look into that.,2289.253,1.235
I don&amp;#39;t have one at this time.,2290.488,1.668
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",2292.156,1.502
Early voting has begun in the Georgia Sixth,2293.658,1.835
Congressional District special election to fill,2295.493,2.702
the seat of Secretary Price.,2298.195,2.703
Some Democrats are billing this is a referendum on,2300.898,2.77
"the President, the early days of the presidency.",2303.668,1.768
What does the White House think of that?,2305.436,1.501
And does President Trump plan to be involved,2306.937,1.635
at all in this race?,2308.572,1.735
"Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s a good -- honestly, I&amp;#39;ve not even",2310.307,1.702
thought about it.,2312.009,1.402
"I think that if needed, the President has always",2313.411,3.036
been very clear that he wants to support,2316.447,2.469
the team and help the team.,2318.916,1.535
"Honestly, I&amp;#39;ve not tried to really focus on -",2320.451,2.269
(laughter),2322.72,1.168
-- tried to shed that previous life a little.,2323.888,2.302
"So, I&amp;#39;ve not looked into Georgia -- the race in Georgia.",2326.19,4.371
I&amp;#39;m sure I&amp;#39;d best refer you to either the RNC,2330.561,2.503
or the NRCC on the state of that race.,2333.064,2.235
"Thank you, guys, very much.",2335.299,1.301
"I&amp;#39;ll see you tomorrow, Thursday.",2336.6,1.669
Take care.,2338.269,2.235
