"Matt, you had a phenomenal story today.",0.633,1.869
(Laughter.),2.502,4.938
Get that joke?,7.44,1.268
"If you didn&amp;#39;t, look it up.",8.708,3.671
A little delayed reaction to that.,12.379,2.002
(Laughter.),14.381,0.967
"Before I get into the events of today,",15.348,1.035
"there&amp;#39;s a few items I wanted to update you on,",16.383,2.268
things that have happened since our last briefing yesterday.,18.651,3.104
The President spoke with Prime Minister al-Abadi,21.755,1.901
of Iraq to thank him for his productive visit,23.656,2.636
and meeting on March 20th.,26.292,2.103
A readout of that call should have been issued,28.395,1.835
after the pool last night.,30.23,1.935
"Yesterday, he also notified Congress that",32.165,2.402
the national emergency declared Executive Order,34.567,2.236
13694 regarding malicious cyber-enabled attacks,36.803,5.839
"will continue beyond April 1st, 2017.",42.642,2.836
"As you all know, this notification is required",45.478,2.069
by statute in order to extend the national,47.547,2.536
emergency that the past administration declared.,50.083,2.803
The President believes that the significant,52.886,1.835
cyber-enabled activities continue to pose an unusual,54.721,3.303
and extraordinary threat to our national,58.024,1.635
"security and economic prosperity, and therefore",59.659,2.569
he has determined that it was necessary to continue,62.228,2.336
this national emergency.,64.564,1.668
"Last night, a federal judge in Hawaii put",66.232,1.802
an indefinite hold on the President&amp;#39;s executive,68.034,1.869
order that was issued on national security.,69.903,3.203
The Department of Justice is reviewing the ruling,73.106,2.102
and is considering the best way to defend,75.208,2.803
the President&amp;#39;s lawful and necessary order.,78.011,2.536
This ruling is just the latest step that will,80.547,1.902
allow the administration to appeal.,82.449,2.602
"Just a week ago, the U.S. District Court",85.051,1.668
in the Eastern District of Virginia upheld the President&amp;#39;s,86.719,2.303
order on the merits.,89.022,1.368
The White House firmly believes that this order,90.39,2.002
"is lawful and necessary, and will ultimately be",92.392,2.769
allowed to move forward.,95.161,2.603
"This morning, we announced that the President will",97.764,1.702
host President Xi of China at Mar-a-Lago on April 6th and 7th.,99.466,4.437
The President looks forward to meeting with,103.903,2.036
President Xi and exchanging views on,105.939,1.801
each other&amp;#39;s respective priorities and to chart,107.74,2.503
a way forward on a bilateral relationship between,110.243,2.169
our two nations.,112.412,1.368
"They will discuss the issues of mutual concern,",113.78,2.035
"including North Korea, trade, and regional security.",115.815,3.671
"Now, on to some of the events of today.",119.486,1.935
"This morning, the President had a meeting",121.421,1.635
with Treasury Secretary Mnuchin.,123.056,2.369
"The Secretary, along with the National Economic",125.425,1.902
Council and the rest of the President&amp;#39;s team,127.327,2.502
of experts have been meeting with and hearing from,129.829,2.469
stakeholders on all sides of the tax reform debate.,132.298,3.671
Tax reform has been a centerpiece of the President&amp;#39;s,135.969,1.902
economic agenda from the beginning of his campaign.,137.871,3.303
The team is weighing the best option to develop,141.174,1.902
a plan that will provide significant middle-class,143.076,2.702
tax relief and make American businesses more competitive.,145.778,3.637
Enacting the first significant tax reform,149.415,2.069
since the 1980s is going to be a serious undertaking.,151.484,3.37
"And we are at the first stages of this process,",154.854,2.836
"beginning to engage with members of Congress,",157.69,1.769
"policy groups, business leaders, industry,",159.459,2.602
"constituents from around the country, and other stakeholders.",162.061,3.704
Tax reform has been a part of the political,165.765,1.568
"discussion for years, and, accordingly, lots",167.333,2.403
of people have a lot of ideas about it.,169.736,2.135
We intend to hear from them.,171.871,1.969
He and his team will continue to meet with,173.84,1.635
those who support and oppose the various policy,175.475,2.769
"options, as they all are still on the table,",178.244,2.002
because the President is committed to delivering,180.246,1.969
results that the American people and American,182.215,2.035
businesses will be able to see and feel in their paychecks.,184.25,3.604
"On the Hill this morning, the President was glad",187.854,1.835
that the nominations of his Secretary of Agriculture,189.689,2.87
designate Governor Sonny Perdue and Secretary of Labor designate,192.559,3.47
advanced out of committee.,196.029,1.535
Although he was disappointed to see that,197.564,1.835
Democratic senators who had previously expressed,199.399,1.935
"their support for Alex Acosta, the Labor",201.334,2.869
"Secretary-designee, nonetheless, while they",204.203,3.337
"had previously supported him, seem to have stuck",207.54,1.635
to a party-line vote.,209.175,1.668
The President looks forward to having them,210.843,1.335
officially on the team and in the Cabinet as soon as possible.,212.178,3.57
"Also, this morning, the Department of Commerce and",215.748,2.002
First Responder Network Authority FirstNet,217.75,2.503
announced that AT&amp;amp;T will build the first nationwide,220.253,2.202
"broadband, a network dedicated to America&amp;#39;s",222.455,2.469
first responders.,224.924,0.868
This step was part of the 9/11 Commission&amp;#39;s,225.792,2.402
recommendations on improving the ability,228.194,1.568
"of our police, fire, and emergency medical",229.762,2.436
personnel to communicate seamlessly across,232.198,2.236
"jurisdictions, which is critical to their missions.",234.434,3.036
It&amp;#39;s also a sign of the incredible ability of,237.47,2.536
public-private partnerships to drive,240.006,1.802
innovation and solve some of our biggest problems,241.808,2.836
while also creating jobs and growing the economy.,244.644,3.603
"Back to the schedule, this afternoon the President",248.247,1.635
hosted a legislative affairs lunch on opioid and drug abuse.,249.882,3.571
The lunch was an opportunity to discuss,253.453,1.835
the goals and agenda of the President&amp;#39;s Commission,255.288,2.669
"on Combatting Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis,",257.957,2.836
which he established yesterday.,260.793,2.703
"The commission, which is going to be chaired by new",263.496,2.002
"Jersey Governor Chris Christie, is the next step",265.498,2.436
in the President&amp;#39;s promise to the American people,267.934,1.968
that he would take real action to keep drugs from,269.902,2.403
pouring into our country and corrupting,272.305,1.668
our communities.,273.973,1.235
"Under Governor Christie&amp;#39;s leadership, and working",275.208,1.768
closely with the White House Office of American,276.976,1.935
"Innovation, the commission will bring together",278.911,2.203
leaders on both sides of the aisle to find the best,281.114,1.935
ways to treat and protect the American people,283.049,2.97
from this epidemic.,286.019,3.637
Many members in attendance at the lunch played,289.656,2.168
a key part in passing the bipartisan Comprehensive,291.824,3.037
"Addiction and Recovery Act, also known as CARA,",294.861,2.969
the first major federal addiction legislation in,297.83,3.204
"40 years, which authorized over $181 million to fight",301.034,4.137
the opioid epidemic.,305.171,2.336
Part of the mission of the President&amp;#39;s commission,307.507,1.501
will be to ensure that those funds are spent,309.008,1.969
efficiently and effectively.,310.977,1.868
Too many lives are at stake to risk wasting,312.845,3.07
any money on this effort.,315.915,1.568
"Moving on, later this afternoon the President",317.483,1.702
will welcome Prime Minister Rasmussen,319.185,1.635
of Denmark for a working visit.,320.82,3.203
We&amp;#39;ll have a readout on their bilateral meeting,324.023,1.702
for you at its conclusion.,325.725,1.735
"A couple follow-ups from yesterday, I know Hunter",327.46,2.436
asked about the House and the Senate passage,329.896,3.336
disapproving of the Federal Communications,333.232,1.969
regulations on privacy rules from last year.,335.201,3.27
"So, let me just expand on that a little and get",338.471,1.835
to your question.,340.306,1.201
The White House supports Congress using its authority,341.507,2.336
under the Congressional Review Act,343.843,1.668
to roll back last year&amp;#39;s FCC rules on broadband regulation.,345.511,3.971
"The previous administration, in an attempt to treat Internet",349.482,2.603
"service providers differently than edge providers,",352.085,3.169
"such as Google and Facebook, reclassified them",355.254,2.303
as common carriers --,357.557,1.635
much like a hotel or another retail outlet --,359.192,3.403
and opened the door to an unfair regulatory framework.,362.595,2.97
This will allow all service providers to be,365.565,1.801
treated fairly and consumer protection and privacy concerns,367.366,3.17
to be reviewed on an equal playing field.,370.536,2.469
The President pledged to reverse this type of,373.005,2.269
federal overreach in which bureaucrats in Washington,375.274,3.003
take the interests of one group of companies over,378.277,3.471
"the interests of others, picking winners and losers.",381.748,3.169
The President has signed more legislation under the,384.917,1.869
"Congressional Review Act, ending job-killing rules",386.786,2.703
and regulations than all previous Presidents,389.489,2.235
"combined already, and he will continue to fight",391.724,2.269
Washington red tape that stifles American,393.993,2.069
"innovation, job creation and economic growth.",396.062,4.171
"Jeff was here yesterday, Roberta is here now --",400.233,1.902
"but following up on Jeff&amp;#39;s question, he asked about",402.135,2.435
the administration&amp;#39;s position on the Paris climate treaty.,404.57,3.704
We are currently reviewing issues related to the,408.274,1.802
"agreement, and expect to have a decision by the time",410.076,3.303
"of the G7 Summit, late May-ish, if not sooner.",413.379,3.904
"Before I take your questions, I wanted",417.283,1.335
to speak quickly about Judge Gorsuch again and the process,418.618,2.335
behind his nomination and confirmation.,420.953,2.102
"From the beginning, I think the President has",423.055,2.47
been clear and 100 percent transparent about his,425.525,2.035
"choices, if he had been elected, who he would",427.56,2.436
choose from.,429.996,1.001
"As a matter of fact, I&amp;#39;d say that the level of",430.997,1.401
"transparency is probably unprecedented in modern times,",432.398,2.536
at least.,434.934,1.435
"During the campaign, he gave the American people",436.369,1.902
a list of 21 judges which he would pick his choice,438.271,2.469
for the Supreme Court from.,440.74,1.468
The American people sent him to the White House,442.208,1.501
to nominate one of those judges -- and he did it.,443.709,2.77
"Prior to the President making his final decision,",446.479,2.035
the White House spoke with 29 senators -- more than,448.514,2.569
half of whom were from the Democrat side of the,451.083,1.969
"aisle, including every Democrat member of the",453.052,2.169
Senate Judiciary Committee -- to seek their advice,455.221,1.969
and consent on the nomination.,457.19,2.335
The consensus was that the President&amp;#39;s pick should be,459.525,2.102
a respected mainstream judge.,461.627,2.036
"As I&amp;#39;ve laid out many times before, from",463.663,2.068
unanimous consent of the 10th Circuit Court,465.731,2.87
of Appeals to the extraordinarily low rate,468.601,2.369
"of majority opinions accompanied by dissent,",470.97,2.436
Judge Gorsuch is the definition,473.406,1.935
"of a mainstream, respected judge.",475.341,3.17
He has offered the Senate plenty of material,478.511,1.868
to vouch for that.,480.379,1.101
"Since his nomination, Judge Gorsuch met with",481.48,1.969
nearly 80 senators.,483.449,1.935
In response to requests from the Senate Judiciary,485.384,2.002
"Committee, Judge Gorsuch provided the following,",487.386,2.736
over 70 pages of written answers about his personal,490.122,3.337
records in response to 299 questions for the record,493.459,4.204
"by Democrats on the committee, the most",497.663,2.469
"in recent history, which he submitted within six days",500.132,2.87
"of receiving the questions; over 75,000",503.002,2.803
"pages of documents, including speeches, case",505.805,2.502
"briefs, opinions, and written work going back",508.307,2.77
"as far as college; and over 180,000 pages of email",511.077,4.337
and paper records related to the judge&amp;#39;s time,515.414,2.603
"at the Department of Justice In fact, the Department of Justice",518.017,3.036
provided access to many documents that would,521.053,1.669
"normally be guarded by various privileges,",522.722,2.202
in a historically unprecedented move in the spirit of,524.924,3.47
cooperation with Senate Democrats.,528.394,1.969
And the judge sat for three rounds and nearly,530.363,2.002
20 hours of questioning by the Senate Judiciary,532.365,2.068
"Committee, during which he was asked nearly 1,200",534.433,4.271
"questions, almost twice as many as Justices",538.704,2.77
"Sotomayor, Kagan, or Ginsburg.",541.474,2.903
The White House and the judge did all of this,544.377,2.035
"in the hopes that Senate Democrats, many of whom",546.412,2.302
already had announced their intent to filibuster,548.714,1.869
"Judge Gorsuch&amp;#39;s nomination, would look",550.583,2.202
beyond their political game and see for,552.785,1.602
themselves how eminently qualified he is to sit,554.387,2.936
on the Supreme Court.,557.323,1.501
"Unfortunately, it looks more and more like Senate",558.824,2.403
Democrats would rather do all that they did,561.227,2.135
in reading and questioning for nothing more than,563.362,2.836
for political theater.,566.198,2.269
"Finally, before I take your questions, a letter",568.467,3.304
was transmitted just recently to the ranking,571.771,2.936
member and chairman of the House and Senate,574.707,2.502
"Intelligence Committees that said, &amp;quot;In the ordinary course",577.209,3.471
"of business, national security staff discovered documents",580.68,3.069
"that we believe are in response to your March 15, 2017 letter",583.749,3.938
to the intelligence community seeking &amp;#39;documents necessary,587.687,3.336
to determine whether information,591.023,1.802
collected on U.S. persons was mishandled and leaked.&amp;#39;&amp;quot;,592.825,4.104
We have and will invite the Senate and House ranking members,596.929,4.438
and Chairman up to the White House to view that material,601.367,3.904
in accordance with their schedule.,605.271,1.802
"With that, I&amp;#39;d be glad to take a few of your questions.",607.073,2.869
Cheryl.,609.942,1.702
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",611.644,1.268
I&amp;#39;m trying to gauge the probability,612.912,2.302
of a government shutdown at the end of April.,615.214,2.536
Are your directions to the Capitol Hill to hold firm,617.75,3.437
"on the spending cuts that the President wants,",621.187,2.736
or to try to wheel and deal and get a bill that can keep,623.923,3.036
the government open?,626.959,1.902
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know that they&amp;#39;re mutually exclusive.,628.861,1.235
I think we want --,630.096,2.035
The Press: You wouldn&amp;#39;t want pushback on Capitol Hill,632.131,1.101
from some --,633.232,0.868
Mr. Spicer: There generally is.,634.1,2.335
But I think that we want both.,636.435,1.702
I think we want to maintain some of the,638.137,2.369
spending priorities as well as some,640.506,1.635
of the reductions in the 2017 budget.,642.141,3.437
We want to do so responsibly and do so,645.578,1.735
within the priorities that the President has laid out.,647.313,2.102
I think his funding requests and priorities,649.415,3.604
are laid out in the budget that Director Mulvaney,653.019,2.869
detailed and sent up for the remainder of 2017.,655.888,3.504
"There are some key things in that, and I think that",659.392,2.736
it is going to begin a conversation that we will,662.128,2.435
continue to have with the House and Senate.,664.563,2.102
But I don&amp;#39;t think both of those goals are mutually exclusive.,666.665,2.269
"Obviously, we don&amp;#39;t want the government to shut down,",668.934,3.437
but we want to make sure that we&amp;#39;re funding the priorities,672.371,1.802
of the government.,674.173,1.001
John Decker.,675.174,1.168
"The Press: Thanks a lot, Sean.",676.342,0.901
I wanted to ask about some news that the President,677.243,2.035
made today with a tweet that he put out on Twitter.,679.278,2.402
He seemed to be picking a fight with the Freedom Caucus;,681.68,3.437
"and the Freedom Caucus, as you know,",685.117,1.402
has 30 members.,686.519,1.668
Does the President realize how important this caucus,688.187,2.236
"is, this coalition is, in terms of passing",690.423,3.269
a replacement bill for the Affordable Care Act,693.692,3.003
and passing the rest of his legislative agenda?,696.695,2.903
"Mr. Spicer: Well, of course he understands",699.598,2.336
that the goal of all legislation is get,701.934,2.035
"to a majority in the House, majority in the Senate.",703.969,4.271
"But at the end of the day, he recognizes that he has",708.24,2.136
a bold and robust agenda that he is trying to enact,710.376,2.903
that he ran on and told the American people that,713.279,3.837
"he would do when he was President, and he&amp;#39;s going",717.116,1.868
to get the votes from wherever he can.,718.984,1.335
The Press: Can he pass that agenda without,720.319,2.269
the help of the Freedom Caucus?,722.588,1.001
"Mr. Spicer: Well, there&amp;#39;s two questions.",723.589,1.368
"One is, I mean, mathematically, yes.",724.957,2.436
"But secondly, I think that there&amp;#39;s a few members",727.393,2.169
"of the Freedom Caucus, both prior to last Friday&amp;#39;s",729.562,2.402
"vote and since then, who have expressed",731.964,2.035
a willingness to want to work with him rather,733.999,2.536
than necessarily as a bloc.,736.535,3.27
And I think that there continues to be some,739.805,3.704
promising signs with that.,743.509,5.005
"So again, I think part of is, is that I think if people",748.514,1.935
are more concerned with voting as a bloc,750.449,1.702
than in what&amp;#39;s in the best interests of their,752.151,2.235
"constituents and the American people,",754.386,1.268
"he&amp;#39;s hoping that people will see the bigger picture,",755.654,2.77
"the goals that we outlined, and sometimes",758.424,2.269
not let the really good be the enemy of the perfect.,760.693,1.735
The Press: He seemed to imply in that tweet that,762.428,2.035
he would be in favor of primary-ing some,764.463,3.737
individuals in the Freedom Caucus who oppose his agenda.,768.2,3.904
Is that correct?,772.104,1.001
Did I read that correctly?,773.105,1.301
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m going to say -- I&amp;#39;m going to let,774.406,1.068
the tweet speak for itself.,775.474,1.135
For those of you who think -- or just for your,776.609,2.469
"understanding, it would be improper of me to discuss",779.078,2.636
the election or defeat of any candidate from this podium.,781.714,2.836
Matt.,784.55,1.134
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",785.684,0.801
"Two questions, if you don&amp;#39;t mind.",786.485,1.502
Mr. Spicer: I want phenomenal questions from you.,787.987,1.234
The Press: That&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ll give you.,789.221,1.435
(Laughter.),790.656,1.068
"First, we know now --",791.724,1.101
Mr. Spicer: You get it?,792.825,1.234
"The Press: No, I got it.",794.059,1.102
(Laughter.),795.161,2.168
"So, two White House officials, according to New York Times",797.329,2.102
"reporting, provided Representative Nunes with",799.431,3.504
the information that he spoke about last week.,802.935,2.035
"And according to the Times, the senior director",804.97,3.47
"for intelligence on the NSC, who was hired by",808.44,2.803
"Michael Flynn, started going through these",811.243,1.902
documents after the President&amp;#39;s tweet --,813.145,2.669
the wiretapping tweet.,815.814,1.202
"So, I&amp;#39;m wondering if the White House thinks it&amp;#39;s",817.016,1.568
appropriate for national security officials to be,818.584,2.603
conducting what&amp;#39;s basically a political,821.187,2.235
"task, which is trying to find information that",823.422,2.703
then validates something the President said.,826.125,2.169
"Mr. Spicer: So I read the report, and respectfully",828.294,2.969
I think your questions assumes that the reporting,831.263,1.969
is correct.,833.232,1.201
The Press: It does.,834.433,0.934
Mr. Spicer: And so I would just suggest to you that,835.367,2.436
the letter that was submitted earlier to,837.803,2.002
the ranking -- the chairman and the ranking members,839.805,2.703
of the two committees -- two intelligence committees,842.508,2.235
"on the Hill, the reason that the White House has asked",844.743,3.204
them to come up is to view that information.,847.947,2.168
"And again, I don&amp;#39;t want to get in front of that.",850.115,3.07
"As I&amp;#39;ve said before, we are not as obsessed with",853.185,3.404
the process as much as the substance.,856.589,1.167
And I think that our goal is to make sure that the,857.756,3.437
"ranking members of both committees, as well as",861.193,2.336
"the chairman, see the information that --",863.529,4.204
"the materials that are important to this,",867.733,2.102
and then worry about the outcome at the end of this.,869.835,2.569
"The Press: And then on a different topic, with",872.404,2.269
"Ms. Walsh&amp;#39;s departure today, are you expecting",874.673,3.337
any more staffing shakeups in the West Wing?,878.01,2.803
Mr. Spicer: No.,880.813,1.435
Catherine.,882.248,1.101
"The Press: Sean, are you saying that The New York",883.349,1.401
Times reporting today is not correct on whoever was,884.75,1.802
-- Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m saying that in order to comment,886.552,3.003
"on that story, would be to validate certain things",889.555,4.971
that I am not at liberty to do.,894.526,2.436
"The Press: For days, you haven&amp;#39;t been able to tell",896.962,1.135
"us who he met with, what the circumstances were.",898.097,1.568
Mr. Spicer: And I understand that.,899.665,1.335
"And again, and I think that there is an",901,3.536
"assumption, as I&amp;#39;ve said before, we cannot condone",904.536,1.368
that -- in the same way that you protect sources,905.904,2.47
when I call you and say you&amp;#39;ve got 18 anonymous,908.374,2.702
"sources, and you go, well, I can&amp;#39;t reveal my sources;",911.076,2.503
Chairman Nunes in conducting an investigation,913.579,2.269
and a review has an opportunity to have his sources.,915.848,3.069
Our view was -- is that the smart move was to make,918.917,3.404
all the materials available to the chairman,922.321,2.502
and the ranking member of the relevant committees.,924.823,2.403
And I understand the obsession with the process,927.226,3.737
"piece, but we are focused on the substance of it.",930.963,2.803
And I think the goal is to make sure that people have,933.766,2.669
the substance that are looking into this that we,936.435,2.97
have asked to look into this --,939.405,1.868
"The Press: So, the White House did make materials",941.273,1.802
available already?,943.075,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, we have sent a letter within",944.41,2.168
the past few hours to both of those committees,946.578,4.371
informing them that we wanted to make that,950.949,1.902
available to them.,952.851,1.235
The Press: And what kind of message do you think,954.086,1.068
this sends to people watching this?,955.154,1.401
Does it --,956.555,1.135
Mr. Spicer: I think it sends a message that we want them to,957.69,2.168
"look into this, that I think that -- as we have maintained",959.858,2.269
"from all along, that I think there&amp;#39;s a belief that",962.127,2.169
the President has maintained that there was surveillance,964.296,3.27
that occurred during the 2016 election that was,967.566,3.737
"improper, and that we want people to look into this",971.303,2.569
and take the appropriate legal responsible steps,973.872,3.504
to both understand it and then address it.,977.376,2.936
Major.,980.312,1.468
The Press: I want to read to you something you said,981.78,1.669
here at the podium on March 23rd when you were,983.449,2.135
originally asked if the White House might have had,985.584,1.935
any role in providing information to Chairman Nunes.,987.519,3.47
"You first said it didn&amp;#39;t make any sense to you, and",990.989,2.503
"you went to say -- and I&amp;#39;m quoting you here, &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t",993.492,1.969
know why he&amp;quot; -- Chairman Nunes -- &amp;quot;would brief the,995.461,2.469
Speaker and then come down here to brief us on,997.93,1.501
something that we would have briefed him on.,999.431,2.102
It doesn&amp;#39;t seem to make a ton of sense.,1001.533,1.869
"So, I&amp;#39;m not aware of it, but it doesn&amp;#39;t really pass",1003.402,1.835
the smell test.&amp;quot;,1005.237,1.568
There is now reporting -- which I can&amp;#39;t tell if,1006.805,1.669
you&amp;#39;re disputing or not -- that identifies two people,1008.474,3.069
within this White House as the sources of this information.,1011.543,3.404
"So I&amp;#39;m just trying to put these things together,",1014.947,1.501
where you said it &amp;quot;doesn&amp;#39;t pass the smell test&amp;quot;,1016.448,2.036
on March 23rd.,1018.484,1.167
Now there&amp;#39;s reporting that suggests that it is within,1019.651,2.002
"the White House, that they were the sources of this.",1021.653,2.369
I&amp;#39;m just trying to put those two things together.,1024.022,1.669
"Mr. Spicer: All right, so number one, the first",1025.691,1.468
"quote that you&amp;#39;re reading, if you actually go back, I",1027.159,2.169
"was responding to -- I was very clear that I said,",1029.328,2.669
&amp;quot;Based on what Chairman Nunes has said&amp;quot; -- the,1031.997,3.27
following doesn&amp;#39;t make sense.,1035.267,1.068
"The Press: Okay, so within that.",1036.335,1.334
Mr. Spicer: But that&amp;#39;s an important part --,1037.669,1.368
The Press: I&amp;#39;m gathering that you&amp;#39;ve,1039.037,1.068
"learned something new since then, so please",1040.105,1.135
tell us what you&amp;#39;ve learned.,1041.24,1.201
"Mr. Spicer: Right, and again -- no, no, no,",1042.441,1.234
"because again, Major, I&amp;#39;ve commented on this both",1043.675,1.302
"yesterday and today, that your obsession with who",1044.977,3.069
talked to whom and when is not the answer here.,1048.046,2.503
It should be the substance.,1050.549,1.435
In the same way that when you guys print a story,1051.984,1.768
"with 18 anonymous sources, your obsession is the substance,",1053.752,2.97
it seems now that you continue to look at from a backwards,1056.722,3.537
"prism, which is, &amp;quot;What happened?",1060.259,1.568
Who drove in what gate?,1061.827,0.968
Who did they meet with?,1062.795,0.834
What were they wearing that day?&amp;quot;,1063.629,1.334
"as opposed to, &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s the underlying substance of this?",1064.963,2.203
Did something happen in the 2016 election?,1067.166,3.97
Did leaks occur?&amp;quot;,1071.136,1.135
We are not going to engage actively in that kind,1072.271,3.937
of leaking that has been a problem.,1076.208,2.436
"In fact, if you look at Obama&amp;#39;s Deputy Assistant",1078.644,4.704
"Secretary of Defense that is out there, Evelyn",1083.348,1.936
"Farkas, she made it clear that it was their goal",1085.284,4.037
"to spread this information around, that they went",1089.321,2.669
around and did this.,1091.99,1.001
"And she said, &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s why there are so many leaks.&amp;quot;",1092.991,2.937
They have admitted on the record that this was their,1095.928,2.602
goal -- to leak stuff.,1098.53,1.635
And they literally -- she said on the record,1100.165,2.403
&amp;quot;Trump&amp;#39;s team.&amp;quot;,1102.568,1.201
There are serious questions out there about,1103.769,2.035
what happened and why and who did it.,1105.804,2.536
And I think that&amp;#39;s really where our focus,1108.34,1.735
is in making sure that that information gets out.,1110.075,2.269
"The Press: But can&amp;#39;t the process, from your vantage",1112.344,3.604
"point, validate the importance of the substance?",1115.948,2.402
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think there&amp;#39;s a review that",1118.35,2.035
we&amp;#39;ve asked for probably --,1120.385,1.102
The Press: And you&amp;#39;ve told us that you&amp;#39;re willing to look,1121.487,2.402
into and ask questions about the process and provide us answers.,1123.889,2.903
That&amp;#39;s all I&amp;#39;m trying to --,1126.792,1.068
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, no -- no, don&amp;#39;t -- please don&amp;#39;t put words",1127.86,1.735
in my mouth. I never said I would provide you answers.,1129.595,1.902
I said we would look into it.,1131.497,1.868
The responsible thing for us to do is to provide,1133.365,2.803
the individuals and the committees who are doing,1136.168,2.169
the review the materials that they&amp;#39;re looking for --,1138.337,2.936
or some of them.,1141.273,0.834
We don&amp;#39;t know how many -- what they&amp;#39;re exactly,1142.107,1.368
"looking for, what they&amp;#39;ve seen, and what they haven&amp;#39;t.",1143.475,2.136
Our goal is to be as forthright as possible.,1145.611,1.902
They asked the intelligence communities,1147.513,1.634
and others in a March letter for information.,1149.147,4.405
We are willing to provide them with the information,1153.552,4.438
that we have -- the materials that we have,1157.99,2.469
come across.,1160.459,1.401
And I think that is an important step.,1161.86,1.235
"Again, it is not -- our obligation is to make sure",1163.095,2.035
the review is done both in the House and the Senate,1165.13,2.436
"as we asked for a few weeks ago, not to make",1167.566,2.035
sure that we illegally leak out information to you.,1169.601,3.137
"The Press: And when you say &amp;quot;we have information,&amp;quot;",1172.738,3.136
are you disputing the reports in the New York Times?,1175.874,3.303
"Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not commenting on the reports, Major.",1179.177,3.137
I just got asked the same question.,1182.314,0.867
The Press: But you&amp;#39;re saying &amp;quot;we.&amp;quot;,1183.181,2.57
"So, I&amp;#39;m just trying to find out, they&amp;#39;re naming",1185.751,1.234
"some people that work for the NSC, who work",1186.985,1.201
at this White House --,1188.186,1.102
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, no, I&amp;#39;m saying -- no, &amp;quot;we&amp;quot; meaning",1189.288,1.001
"the White House, is not going to start confirming --",1190.289,1.101
The Press: -- who have been named now publicly,1191.39,1.168
for the first time.,1192.558,0.9
Mr. Spicer: I get it.,1193.458,1.001
We are not going to start commenting on one-off,1194.459,1.335
anonymous sources that publications publish.,1195.794,0.901
"The Press: If it were wrong, would you tell us?",1196.695,1.768
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to get into it.,1198.463,1.335
"As I&amp;#39;ve just said, I get it.",1199.798,1.068
How many times you can ask the same question?,1200.866,2.235
Hunter.,1203.101,0.968
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",1204.069,1.068
I have two questions.,1205.137,1.101
"The first, President Trump is pushing for a major tax cut,",1206.238,2.035
increases in defense and infrastructure,1208.273,1.702
"spending, and the border wall.",1209.975,1.468
"Does he think this agenda has to be deficit-neutral,",1211.443,2.436
or is he open to plans that might initially,1213.879,1.802
add to the debt?,1215.681,0.8
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think when it comes to tax",1216.481,2.036
"reform, he&amp;#39;s got three underlying goals.",1218.517,3.303
"One is tax simplification, two is to lower the rates,",1221.82,2.803
and three is to grow jobs and the economy.,1224.623,4.037
"And I think part of it is, is that if you look",1228.66,2.703
"at it dynamically, as the plan develops -- and again,",1231.363,2.302
"as I mentioned earlier, we&amp;#39;re not there yet; we are",1233.665,1.869
beginning that process of engaging with stakeholders.,1235.534,2.469
"As the plan develops and there&amp;#39;s a cost put on it,",1238.003,2.703
that&amp;#39;s going to be a decision that gets looked,1240.706,2.302
at as well as what are the economic growth,1243.008,1.668
and job-creation aspects to it.,1244.676,1.368
So to answer that question without knowing what,1246.044,2.57
"the full scope of it is, is looking at something",1248.614,2.402
and answering it in a vacuum.,1251.016,1.735
"The Press: And then, just to clarify one thing with",1252.751,1.635
"the New York Times story, I know you won&amp;#39;t identify",1254.386,2.569
"Congressman Nunes as &amp;quot;sources,&amp;quot; but isn&amp;#39;t",1256.955,2.236
it abundantly clear that at least some White House,1259.191,2.402
officials had to be involved in him getting,1261.593,2.369
information here because they would need to help,1263.962,1.969
them access the complex?,1265.931,1.034
Mr. Spicer: I cannot get into who those individuals were.,1266.965,5.873
"The Press: Right, but it was someone",1272.838,1.334
"at the White House, right?",1274.172,1.268
"Mr. Spicer: Well, again, it&amp;#39;s -- again, if I start",1275.44,2.069
going down the path of confirming and denying,1277.509,1.668
"one thing, that we&amp;#39;re going down a very slippery slope.",1279.177,2.736
I&amp;#39;ve made our position very clear on that.,1281.913,1.802
Jessica.,1283.715,0.868
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",1284.583,1.735
Thank you for announcing the visit of the Chinese President.,1286.318,2.669
"I have a couple of questions about that visit,",1288.987,2.436
if you&amp;#39;d entertain me.,1291.423,2.035
Can you talk about the location and how it was,1293.458,2.102
chosen for this visit?,1295.56,2.169
"Mr. Spicer: There is, as you can imagine, on any",1297.729,2.369
"trip, no matter who the foreign leader is,",1300.098,2.169
there&amp;#39;s a lot of discussion that goes back and forth between,1302.267,2.669
"the White House, the State Department",1304.936,2.369
"and the equivalents of the other head of governments,",1307.305,4.305
their appropriate counterparts.,1311.61,2.135
And those are the kind of things that go back,1313.745,1.468
"and forth in terms of how long, the activities,",1315.213,2.803
what will be discussed.,1318.016,2.336
Every single thing is discussed on both sides.,1320.352,3.103
"And so, that was a long and ongoing negotiation",1323.455,4.137
with the government of China and with their,1327.592,2.47
representatives lasting several weeks now.,1330.062,3.637
"The Press: So, how did you arrive at Mar-a-Lago",1333.699,1.368
as opposed to the White House?,1335.067,1.368
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to get into the back and forth.,1336.435,1.034
I would just suggest to you that both sides,1337.469,2.102
discussed various locations and topics,1339.571,2.503
"and agendas and length, et cetera, and aspects",1342.074,3.903
to the trip.,1345.977,0.668
And this is what we&amp;#39;ve arrived at.,1346.645,1.334
"The Press: So, what is the goal for the White House",1347.979,1.802
to accomplish during the visit?,1349.781,1.635
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think there&amp;#39;s a few things.",1351.416,1.135
"One is, I think this is an opportunity",1352.551,1.701
for President Trump to develop a relationship in person,1354.252,3.07
with President Xi.,1357.322,1.101
He&amp;#39;s spoken to him on the phone a few times.,1358.423,2.903
"But we have big problems, and -- I mean, everything",1361.326,2.069
"from the South China Sea, to trade, to North Korea.",1363.395,4.471
There are big issues of national and economic,1367.866,1.802
"security that need to get addressed, and I think",1369.668,2.636
there&amp;#39;s going to be a lot on the table when it comes,1372.304,1.468
to that over the two days that they will talk.,1373.772,1.735
"The Press: And lastly, the Chinese are expecting",1375.507,2.536
the White House to provide some sort of framework,1378.043,1.868
for the relationship to be viewed for.,1379.911,2.236
Are you prepared for that?,1382.147,1.201
And can you talk a little bit about what that,1383.348,2.102
framework might be?,1385.45,1.168
Mr. Spicer: Can you expand on that a little?,1386.618,1.135
The Press: Kind of put a floor under the,1387.753,1.901
"relationship, looking for how to view the relationship.",1389.654,2.77
"Obviously, you had the rebalance and the pivot",1392.424,2.436
in the prior administration.,1394.86,1.334
Is there a tagline or a vision for U.S.- China,1396.194,2.97
relations that you will roll out during this visit?,1399.164,2.936
Mr. Spicer: We&amp;#39;ll see.,1402.1,1.068
"I&amp;#39;m not -- if you have any hashtags, let me know.",1403.168,2.669
But I think right now we&amp;#39;re not worried so much,1405.837,2.503
about slogans as much as progress.,1408.34,2.469
There&amp;#39;s a lot of big things that we need to,1410.809,1.702
"accomplish with China, and I think that we will work on them.",1412.511,3.103
Kristen.,1415.614,0.667
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1416.281,1.268
Did the President direct anyone in this White House,1417.549,2.502
or in his national security team to try,1420.051,2.57
to find information or intelligence to back up,1422.621,2.702
his assertion about wiretapping?,1425.323,3.537
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t -- I&amp;#39;m not aware of anything directly.,1428.86,3.304
"I&amp;#39;d have to look into that in terms of -- again,",1432.164,2.002
there&amp;#39;s two sides to this.,1434.166,1.101
"One is the information side, and two is the",1435.267,1.868
policy and the activities and the legal piece,1437.135,3.07
of what happened.,1440.205,1.001
"And I don&amp;#39;t -- those are big buckets, if you will.",1441.206,5.038
"The Press: So, it&amp;#39;s possible.",1446.244,1.402
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to comment on it.,1447.646,1.401
The Press: And one more.,1449.047,1.301
Don&amp;#39;t sort of the daily questions about this make,1450.348,3.337
it necessary to have some type of outside,1453.685,2.269
independent investigation to lift any lingering,1455.954,3.57
cloud that there may be?,1459.524,1.635
Mr. Spicer: No.,1461.159,1.068
The Press: Why?,1462.227,1.268
Mr. Spicer: I think you have two committees,1463.495,1.201
looking into this.,1464.696,1.034
"The FBI has been looking into this, as they",1465.73,1.535
mentioned at the hearing.,1467.265,1.001
"I mean, how many do you want?",1468.266,1.402
I understand that you may not have --,1469.668,2.302
The Press: Do you think the House intelligence investigation,1471.97,1.835
is still valid given all of these questions?,1473.805,2.469
Mr. Spicer: How is it not valid?,1476.274,2.002
I&amp;#39;m asking --,1478.276,1.101
The Press: There are all these questions about,1479.377,1.168
"where Devin Nunes got his information from,",1480.545,2.403
was it politically motivated to lift that cloud.,1482.948,3.136
Would it not be smart to have an outside,1486.084,2.269
independent investigation?,1488.353,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: No -- well, again, I think you got the",1489.688,1.835
"FBI, probably other intelligence committees",1491.523,2.569
that looked -- 17 of them issued a report earlier,1494.092,2.803
in terms of involvement in the 2016 election.,1496.895,2.903
And then you&amp;#39;ve got two congressional committees,1499.798,2.903
looking into it.,1502.701,0.901
"So, I&amp;#39;m not really sure the exact need.",1503.602,2.702
I think that people are doing -- I understand,1506.304,2.102
sometimes there&amp;#39;s a need for you guys to have more,1508.406,1.669
information and more sources.,1510.075,1.067
I think this is being done in a responsible way where,1511.142,2.369
people are being discussed -- what they know,1513.511,2.57
at an appropriate classification level and information,1516.081,2.202
is being shared.,1518.283,1.234
The Press: Can you just quickly talk about,1519.517,1.602
the timing of inviting the leaders of this,1521.119,2.836
investigation to the White House now?,1523.955,1.535
Is it because of this report?,1525.49,1.268
Why not do that initially?,1526.758,0.801
Mr. Spicer: I think a couple things.,1527.559,1.435
"One is, they asked -- they tasked the various",1528.994,5.839
"committees in mid-March to -- or the agencies,",1534.833,4.471
"rather, to provide information.",1539.304,2.769
"We felt we had information that was relevant,",1542.073,1.635
and I think there was some -- there&amp;#39;s a desire to make,1543.708,3.704
sure that both sides of the aisle who are looking,1547.412,3.136
"into this, as well as both chambers, had that information.",1550.548,3.537
Anita.,1554.085,1.402
The Press: Eric Trump gave an interview a few days,1555.487,3.036
"ago to Forbes Magazine, in which he said that he",1558.523,2.77
"would update his father regularly, perhaps",1561.293,2.435
"quarterly, on the business, including giving",1563.728,3.27
profitability reports.,1566.998,2.736
"So, I had two questions about that.",1569.734,1.402
"One is, have they spoken about the business since January?",1571.136,3.37
"And two, how does this not violate what the President",1574.506,2.803
set out as the protocols for how he would deal,1577.309,2.869
with the business?,1580.178,0.567
"Mr. Spicer: Well, two things.",1580.745,1.368
I don&amp;#39;t know if they&amp;#39;ve spoken.,1582.113,1.335
It&amp;#39;s not -- this may be a question better directed,1583.448,4.805
to the Trump organization.,1588.253,1.535
"But secondly, I think everything that he&amp;#39;s done",1589.788,2.669
is in accordance with what the Counsel&amp;#39;s Office,1592.457,3.203
and the ethics folks --,1595.66,1.302
"The Press: Just following up, I believe he said that he wasn&amp;#39;t",1596.962,1.401
"going to talk to his children, his sons, about the business.",1598.363,3.036
So how is that --,1601.399,1.235
"The Press: Again, I think everything that is being done",1602.634,2.602
in terms of reports or updates is being done in a consultation,1605.236,4.205
with the Counsel&amp;#39;s Office.,1609.441,2.002
"So, I think that&amp;#39;s -- Justin.",1611.443,2.002
The Press: I have two things I want to ask.,1613.445,2.269
The first is just to follow up on Major,1615.714,1.801
and ask about the substance.,1617.515,2.57
It&amp;#39;s sort of unclear what you guys are telling,1620.085,4.137
the chairman and the ranking members you have.,1624.222,2.402
Is it information that would validate the President&amp;#39;s,1626.624,3.07
claims about surveillance during,1629.694,2.269
the 2016 campaign?,1631.963,1.735
Or is it information about their broader Russia investigation?,1633.698,3.27
I&amp;#39;m trying to --,1636.968,1.068
"Mr. Spicer: Again, I&amp;#39;m not here to share that.",1638.036,1.802
That&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;ve invited them up to view it,1639.838,2.536
"in a classified setting, in an appropriate setting.",1642.374,2.836
It&amp;#39;s not to be shared with people that don&amp;#39;t have,1645.21,3.67
the appropriate clearances and access to --,1648.88,2.469
The Press: But you&amp;#39;re not intending to imply that this,1651.349,3.404
is the information that Chairman Nunes has been talking about.,1654.753,3.036
"Mr. Spicer: No, what I&amp;#39;m suggesting is that there",1657.789,3.27
has been information that has been -- material that,1661.059,2.602
"has been made come to light, and that we want to",1663.661,4.405
make sure that the people who are conducting the,1668.066,2.235
"review have that information, have access to it.",1670.301,1.969
"The Press: And then, Westinghouse Center filed",1672.27,2.936
for bankruptcy yesterday.,1675.206,1.602
I&amp;#39;m wondering if that&amp;#39;s prompted national security,1676.808,1.802
"concerns in the administration, and if there is any effort",1678.61,4.137
within the administration to sort of help them navigate,1682.747,4.038
"this bankruptcy, considering that the --",1686.785,1.668
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;ll have to check on that.,1688.453,1.735
I think there&amp;#39;s obviously a couple departments,1690.188,2.669
that would be interested in that.,1692.857,1.802
Steve.,1694.659,1.101
"The Press: Sean, I just want to ask you to",1695.76,1.101
elaborate more on what you have so far told us.,1696.861,1.468
"You said that in the ordinary course of business,",1698.329,2.77
the national security staff discovered documents.,1701.099,3.47
Can you explain how these documents were uncovered?,1704.569,2.636
"What does it mean ,&amp;quot;In the course of business?&amp;quot;",1707.205,2.069
"Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t think -- no, I&amp;#39;m not.",1709.274,1.368
That&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;ve invited them up into a classified,1710.642,2.836
"setting, is for them to see these materials",1713.478,2.369
and understand it.,1715.847,1.335
This is not the setting that is appropriate,1717.182,1.668
to discuss that.,1718.85,1.101
"The Press: So, who in the national security staff,",1719.951,1.201
"then, uncovered the documents?",1721.152,1.402
Mr. Spicer: Good question.,1722.554,1.101
"That is not -- again, as I&amp;#39;ve mentioned multiple",1723.655,2.602
"times, we&amp;#39;re not here to go through the process.",1726.257,2.102
Our job is to get to the substance of this and to,1728.359,1.802
make sure that the people who have the appropriate,1730.161,2.169
"access and authority to look into this matter,",1732.33,2.436
and then take appropriate steps.,1734.766,1.335
The Press: Are you in a position right now to deny,1736.101,3.003
or rule out the possibility that members,1739.104,3.236
of the national security staff have already,1742.34,1.368
informed the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee?,1743.708,2.002
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to get into any further,1745.71,1.135
details on this.,1746.845,1.101
"I would just suggest to you -- again, if I can",1747.946,1.368
go back for a second to something that the Obama,1749.314,2.636
administration&amp;#39;s Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense,1751.95,3.036
"noted very clearly on the record,",1754.986,2.069
that they were engaged in an effort to spread information,1757.055,3.37
about Trump officials that had come up in intelligence.,1760.425,2.836
That&amp;#39;s not -- that is several networks.,1763.261,3.503
Evelyn Farkas made that proclamation about what,1766.764,3.704
was going on during the Obama administration,1770.468,2.503
regarding the Trump team.,1772.971,0.934
"So, that is something that they made very clear",1773.905,2.736
on the record.,1776.641,0.701
John.,1777.342,0.667
"The Press: A couple of things, Sean.",1778.009,1.335
"First of all, on the Freedom Caucus,",1779.344,2.068
"in response to the President&amp;#39;s tweet,",1781.412,2.036
Congressman Amash of Michigan responded,1783.448,3.437
"on camera, saying, most people don&amp;#39;t like to be",1786.885,2.435
bullied -- in response to the President --,1789.32,2.369
also saying that sending out such tweets is,1791.689,2.837
constructive in the 5th grade and it may allow,1794.526,2.068
"a child to get his way, but that&amp;#39;s not how government works.",1796.594,3.504
Could you take a moment to respond to Congressman Amash?,1800.098,2.335
Was the President trying to bully the Freedom Caucus?,1802.433,3.07
Mr. Spicer: No.,1805.503,1.135
I think this is consistent with everything,1806.638,2.335
that he has said since Friday of last week.,1808.973,4.004
And I think that he is looking for members,1812.977,2.937
"on both sides of the aisle, who want",1815.914,1.768
"to be constructive, to achieve the goal",1817.682,1.502
of a patient-centered healthcare system.,1819.184,1.534
"That&amp;#39;s it, plain and simple.",1820.718,1.202
And I think that his comments and his tweets,1821.92,2.636
speak for themselves with respect to how he feels and why.,1824.556,2.469
"The Press: Following on that, is this",1827.025,2.702
a divide-and-conquer strategy?,1829.727,0.868
"Mr. Spicer: No, it&amp;#39;s a math strategy, which is",1830.595,3.737
"to get to 216 and pass an effort, and continue",1834.332,2.569
to move the agenda forward.,1836.901,1.835
"The Press: And then if I could, following on what",1838.736,1.602
"Major said, you&amp;#39;ve accused people in this room",1840.338,1.635
several times of being more interested in,1841.973,2.336
the process than actually in substance of things.,1844.309,4.504
But when information is discovered by the,1848.813,3.137
"Intelligence Committee Chairman in the House,",1851.95,2.168
"at the White House, that is potentially exculpatory",1854.118,3.437
"to what the President has tweeted out, and it&amp;#39;s",1857.555,3.037
reported that one of the people who was involved,1860.592,2.369
in uncovering that information is a White House staff member,1862.961,3.436
who was kept in his position over the request,1866.397,2.536
of the National Security Advisor,1868.933,1.735
by the political leadership here,1870.668,1.402
"at the White House, does the process not then take",1872.07,2.736
on some relevance?,1874.806,1.001
"Mr. Spicer: Well, the process in the sense that",1875.807,2.569
"we are -- as I&amp;#39;ve noted, we have invited the",1878.376,2.836
chairman and the ranking members who are looking,1881.212,1.935
into this and reviewing the matter up here.,1883.147,2.069
That doesn&amp;#39;t mean that we allow un-cleared members,1885.216,2.102
from the media to come in and look at it.,1887.318,1.902
That means --,1889.22,1.301
The Press: I&amp;#39;m not asking that question.,1890.521,0.901
"Mr. Spicer: No, you are.",1891.422,0.801
You said --,1892.223,0.934
"The Press: No, I&amp;#39;m not asking that question.",1893.157,1.168
"Mr. Spicer: But I think it is, because --",1894.325,1.168
The Press: That&amp;#39;s not what I asked.,1895.493,1.068
"What I asked was, when you have that connection",1896.561,1.268
"of dots all the way along, does the process,",1897.829,2.969
the prominence of this information not become,1900.798,2.269
relevant to the overall investigation?,1903.067,1.936
Mr. Spicer: It&amp;#39;s for the people who are conducting,1905.003,1.935
"the review to decide that, not for the people",1906.938,1.601
in this room to decide it.,1908.539,1.569
It is up to the people who are cleared to look at,1910.108,2.169
"that information and that material, to look at it",1912.277,3.203
and make their evaluations.,1915.48,1.234
And I think they are conducting their review.,1916.714,1.702
"You&amp;#39;ve seen very clearly, both on the House side",1918.416,1.835
"and then starting today on the Senate side, them looking",1920.251,2.302
into this matter.,1922.553,0.668
"That is the appropriate venue, forum,",1923.221,1.735
"and personnel to be reviewing it, plain and simple.",1924.956,2.903
"The Press: Sean, a quick follow up on that.",1927.859,1.368
Mr. Spicer: Zeke.,1929.227,1.334
The Press: You mentioned a couple of times --,1930.561,0.935
Mr. Spicer: Zeke.,1931.496,0.967
The Press: Thank you.,1932.463,1.435
Has the President already been briefed on this information -- ?,1933.898,2.102
"Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sorry, I couldn&amp;#39;t hear you.",1936,1.068
The Press: Has the President been briefed,1937.068,1.101
on this information that you&amp;#39;re now inviting,1938.169,1.135
the congressional committee chairs to come in and view?,1939.304,2.936
And when was he briefed on it?,1942.24,1.802
Mr. Spicer: I will look into that.,1944.042,1.368
I&amp;#39;m not entirely sure when or what the status of that,1945.41,2.469
"is, but I can follow up on that.",1947.879,2.169
"The Press: So, then why would you brief --",1950.048,1.434
why would the White House brief congressional --,1951.482,1.468
Mr. Spicer: I understand the question.,1952.95,1.035
"Like I said, I will look into whether or not --",1953.985,2.302
where that stands.,1956.287,1.168
Blake.,1957.455,1.034
"The Press: Sean, thanks.",1958.489,0.968
A couple on taxes.,1959.457,1.201
"The timeline here had been healthcare first,",1960.658,2.036
tax reform second.,1962.694,2.268
"There was a Fox poll out, released yesterday,",1964.962,1.502
that said 73 percent of Americans want tax reform,1966.464,2.736
to happen this year.,1969.2,1.668
"With healthcare now at least being on hold, is healthcare",1970.868,4.405
the number-one priority for this administration --,1975.273,2.569
is tax reform the number-one priority for this administration,1977.842,3.203
"at this point, or is healthcare still kind of taking up",1981.045,2.403
some of the oxygen?,1983.448,1.701
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I don&amp;#39;t know that it&amp;#39;s taking up oxygen.",1985.149,1.735
I think there&amp;#39;s plenty of oxygen for both to go on.,1986.884,2.236
I think the President would still like to see it done.,1989.12,2.269
But I think there&amp;#39;s no reason that we can&amp;#39;t --,1991.389,2.469
"I mean, if you look at the timeline for tax reform,",1993.858,3.07
"you&amp;#39;re talking several months, and so I think",1996.928,2.669
"the process is beginning on that, and I think you",1999.597,2.302
can have a dual-track strategy.,2001.899,1.635
It&amp;#39;s not an either/or proposition.,2003.534,1.368
The Press: And you described what was going,2004.902,2.236
on with the meeting today as the first phase.,2007.138,2.736
Can you lay out to us what is somewhat entailed,2009.874,3.07
with that first phase?,2012.944,1.301
Is the President being given detailed strategies?,2014.245,2.202
Or is it broad principles?,2016.447,1.302
What is involved in this first phase?,2017.749,1.635
Mr. Spicer: I think it&amp;#39;s a little of both.,2019.384,1.167
They&amp;#39;re talking about the process that they intend,2020.551,3.237
"to partake -- how this is going to lay out,",2023.788,2.235
"who they&amp;#39;re engaging with, how they&amp;#39;re going to begin",2026.023,2.57
"that process, and then some of the guiding",2028.593,1.735
principles in making sure that any updates that,2030.328,3.67
he has or any principles that he wants to suggest,2033.998,1.969
are incorporated into that plan as they begin,2035.967,2.936
to meet with stakeholders.,2038.903,0.834
But part of this is to level-set with him,2039.737,4.204
as to what they intend to do and how they intend to do it.,2043.941,2.903
The Press: And you just mentioned a dual track,2046.844,1.101
"between healthcare and tax reform, but then there&amp;#39;s",2047.945,2.102
also infrastructure hanging out there.,2050.047,1.469
"So, can all of those go together?",2051.516,3.136
Mr. Spicer: Lots of tracks.,2054.652,1.835
"I mean, again, remember they&amp;#39;re not all the same",2056.487,2.87
"people; some of them overlap, some of them don&amp;#39;t.",2059.357,2.369
"But I think part of this is, is that you got",2061.726,1.735
to remember that some things can happen sooner than,2063.461,2.436
others because of the legislative calendar.,2065.897,2.369
Some things are going to take longer because,2068.266,1.902
of both the legislative calendar and because,2070.168,3.303
of the number of individuals involved and the complexity,2073.471,3.904
of the situation.,2077.375,1.001
But there&amp;#39;s a lot of things that can be moving,2078.376,1.635
at once because of how they&amp;#39;ll play out.,2080.011,1.768
John Gizzi.,2081.779,0.668
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",2082.447,2.602
"Turning to the foreign front, yesterday,",2085.049,2.936
"Vladimir Kara-Murza, the twice-poisoned Russian",2087.985,3.637
dissident and vice-chairman of the,2091.622,2.169
"Open Russia Movement, testified before a Senate",2093.791,3.437
"appropriations subcommittee, backing",2097.228,4.204
continued sanctions against Russia.,2101.432,3.07
He also called on Secretary of State Tillerson,2104.502,3.804
to meet with Russian civil society members,2108.306,4.171
"-- in other words, anti-Putin dissidents",2112.477,2.569
like himself -- when he makes his trip to Moscow next month.,2115.046,4.237
Mr. Kara-Murza also said he was meeting with many,2119.283,2.336
"members of Congress of both parties, but he would",2121.619,3.804
be very happy to meet with any administration officials.,2125.423,3.703
Are there any plans for the President or anyone,2129.126,3.637
in the White House to meet with Mr. Kara-Murza?,2132.763,2.636
And will Mr. Tillerson meet with the Russian civil society?,2135.399,4.205
Mr. Spicer: I would suggest to you --,2139.604,1.201
I&amp;#39;m not aware of anything.,2140.805,1.001
"Both the National Security Council, as well as",2141.806,2.869
the State Department are probably more appropriate,2144.675,1.569
for you to address that to.,2146.244,1.434
Alexis.,2147.678,1.569
"The Press: Sean, can I ask a question -- but before",2149.247,1.735
"I do, get some clarification on the answer",2150.982,1.902
that you gave to Hunter and to Major?,2152.884,3.47
I thought it was just yesterday that you said,2156.354,2.402
that when you were asked who cleared in Chairman,2158.756,2.836
"Nunes, that you had asked some preliminary questions",2161.592,2.836
"and not gotten answers, and that you would",2164.428,1.802
continue to ask.,2166.23,1.235
Mr. Spicer: Yeah.,2167.465,1.068
"The Press: So, my question today is, you know",2168.533,1.701
the answers to that and you are saying you will not answer,2170.234,2.636
that question today?,2172.87,1.402
Or you don&amp;#39;t know?,2174.272,1.268
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, that&amp;#39;s not -- right.",2175.54,1.167
"So, what I&amp;#39;m saying to you is, is that the decision",2176.707,1.435
that has been made is to bring in all the relevant,2178.142,3.871
individuals that are reviewing the situation,2182.013,1.868
and make them available; that getting into sources,2183.881,2.77
and process is not the proper way to conduct this review.,2186.651,3.069
And we want the people who are conducting it to,2189.72,1.869
understand more fully the materials --,2191.589,3.403
not necessarily who came in what time and whatever.,2194.992,1.902
"The Press: So, you&amp;#39;re -- just to clarify again,",2196.894,2.469
you asked the questions?,2199.363,1.602
You were not given answers?,2200.965,1.234
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, that&amp;#39;s -- I&amp;#39;m just saying that --",2202.199,1.602
The Press: You said yesterday you asked that,2203.801,1.668
"-- wait, let me finish.",2205.469,1.368
"You said yesterday that you asked, you didn&amp;#39;t",2206.837,2.103
get the answers.,2208.94,0.9
"And so, what you&amp;#39;re telling us today is",2209.84,2.269
"you are never going to get the answer -- you, yourself --",2212.109,2.47
you are never going to get the answer to who cleared,2214.579,1.801
in Chairman Nunes?,2216.38,1.535
"Mr. Spicer: What I&amp;#39;m saying is, is that",2217.915,1.468
the decision was made -- it&amp;#39;s supposed to focus,2219.383,1.969
"on the process, to focus on the substance, and that the decision",2221.352,3.17
was made --,2224.522,1.701
The Press: You&amp;#39;re not answering my question.,2226.223,1.302
"Mr. Spicer: I let you ask the question, so let me",2227.525,2.069
"answer it, please.",2229.594,1.101
And the answer that I&amp;#39;m giving you is that,2230.695,2.569
the decision was made internally to focus on,2233.264,2.102
"the individuals who are doing the review,",2235.366,1.635
"both Republicans and the Democrats, House and Senate,",2237.001,3.503
and have them come in and look,2240.504,1.035
at the materials.,2241.539,1.001
"That&amp;#39;s what the focus should be, Alexis.",2242.54,2.202
Kaitlan.,2244.742,1.068
"The Press: Wait, wait, wait, here&amp;#39;s my bigger question.",2245.81,2.936
"The President has expressed his affirmation,",2248.746,4.104
his support for the finding that Russia,2252.85,2.536
interfered with the 2016 election.,2255.386,2.669
That is the centerpiece of the investigation,2258.055,2.803
at the FBI and the Senate Intelligence Committee.,2260.858,3.07
"My question is -- can you update us, what is",2263.928,2.502
the President doing now in the administration to respond,2266.43,5.639
to Director Comey&amp;#39;s testimony that that,2272.069,3.17
interference is not just election-year-based,2275.239,3.971
but continuing?,2279.21,4.371
"Mr. Spicer: You&amp;#39;re talking about the executive order,",2283.581,1.601
is that correct?,2285.182,1.168
"The Press: I just asked, can you update what",2286.35,1.702
"is the administration doing to prevent that, to --",2288.052,3.537
Mr. Spicer: So okay --,2291.589,1.334
"The Press: -- to respond to that preliminary finding already,",2292.923,4.505
"that we already know, that it is continuing?",2297.428,1.768
"Mr. Spicer: Well, so the executive order that the",2299.196,2.236
President signed that continues the national,2301.432,2.469
emergency deals with looking into malicious,2303.901,3.604
attempts and cyber attempts to come,2307.505,1.768
into the United States.,2309.273,0.868
That&amp;#39;s what the executive order that he signed was.,2310.141,2.302
The Press: That&amp;#39;s the sum total of the response so far?,2312.443,2.402
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I&amp;#39;m not going to get into what&amp;#39;s",2314.845,3.137
being done behind the scenes in terms of,2317.982,1.401
the intelligence and law enforcement community.,2319.383,2.069
But the bottom line is that there was,2321.452,1.401
an emergency declared with respect to challenges,2322.853,4.171
that the United States faces from a variety of actors,2327.024,4.004
outside the United States to come in and use,2331.028,3.737
cyber techniques to hack the United States.,2334.765,2.403
The national emergency will continue under the,2337.168,2.335
President to address the threats that we face,2339.503,2.836
from abroad and from a variety of places.,2342.339,3.637
April.,2345.976,1.102
The Press: Sean?,2347.078,0.934
"The Press: Wait, no.",2348.012,1.134
I was just going to --,2349.146,1.135
The Press: Sean?,2350.281,0.967
Mr. Spicer: April.,2351.248,1.035
"The Press: Yes, Sean.",2352.283,1.001
Mr. Spicer: We&amp;#39;ll get to you.,2353.284,0.934
(Laughter.),2354.218,1.201
The Press: He called on someone else?,2355.419,0.868
I&amp;#39;m sorry.,2356.287,0.967
"Go ahead, and then come back to me.",2357.254,1.135
"Mr. Spicer: Okay, I&amp;#39;ll do Kaitlan and then April.",2358.389,0.867
I&amp;#39;m sorry.,2359.256,1.101
"The Press: She can go first, but I&amp;#39;ll just go after her.",2360.357,1.068
Mr. Spicer: Okay.,2361.425,0.968
(Laughter.),2362.393,1.034
"The Press: Okay, thank you, Kaitlan.",2363.427,3.003
"So, Sean, what is the ultimate goal of the leaders",2366.43,4.538
"coming in to get this information, and will",2370.968,2.136
it be information that Nunes received plus?,2373.104,3.77
Or will it just be basically a synopsis,2376.874,4.037
of a synopsis of what Nunes received?,2380.911,2.703
"Mr. Spicer: Well, it&amp;#39;s going to be the materials",2383.614,2.769
that are relevant to the discussion in the area,2386.383,4.071
that they&amp;#39;re reviewing.,2390.454,1.068
And that&amp;#39;s up to them to decide the relevancy of that.,2391.522,2.636
"I think we have, from the National Security Committee,",2394.158,2.703
has gone into -- come upon some materials that they want,2396.861,3.336
to share with them.,2400.197,0.901
It&amp;#39;s up to them to make a decision about,2401.098,1.735
the relevance of those documents and what,2402.833,1.368
they would lead them to believe.,2404.201,1.335
But there&amp;#39;s two issues here.,2405.536,1.001
"One, April, is what do they see, and then what do",2406.537,3.103
they want to see in addition to that or as a result,2409.64,3.003
of those materials.,2412.643,2.102
Right?,2414.745,1.135
"So, in other words, they may see things and say,",2415.88,1.902
"&amp;quot;Hey, this is interesting, I wonder if there&amp;#39;s",2417.782,1.434
"a pattern; this is interesting, I want to see more.&amp;quot;",2419.216,2.836
Or they may come to a conclusion right away.,2422.052,1.502
But that&amp;#39;s part of the idea of -- to the first,2423.554,2.169
part of your question -- in sharing information,2425.723,1.501
with them is to allow the members of both of,2427.224,2.937
the committees on a bipartisan basis to come in to review,2430.161,2.636
materials that we think are relevant to the issues,2432.797,5.872
that the President talked about with respect,2438.669,2.503
"to surveillance, the masking -- unmasking",2441.172,2.469
"of individuals, the handling of it, et cetera, et cetera.",2443.641,3.203
And then it&amp;#39;s up to those members to decide what,2446.844,2.602
"to do with that information, how to explore that more in depth.",2449.446,4.271
"The Press: So, ultimately, in their questioning, they",2453.717,2.503
"could actually wind up reviewing what Nunes received, possibly?",2456.22,4.571
"If they do, even ask different questions,",2460.791,2.636
just sitting in the intelligence meetings,2463.427,2.703
like the President does -- if he decides to dig more,2466.13,3.47
he&amp;#39;ll give more?,2469.6,0.601
Mr. Spicer: It depends.,2470.201,1.267
I think that&amp;#39;s possible.,2471.468,1.335
I don&amp;#39;t want to prejudge what they ask and what,2472.803,3.237
comes in response to it.,2476.04,1.034
It also has to do with what documents we have.,2477.074,2.035
They may go down a particular trail,2479.109,2.87
"and have to follow up with an agency and say, we saw this,",2481.979,3.971
can we see a follow-up on that.,2485.95,1.968
As you saw from many reports the NSA has,2487.918,3.037
been asked to provide documentation to the House.,2490.955,2.802
My understanding from the reports is that,2493.757,1.602
that was ongoing.,2495.359,1.435
And maybe some of the materials that they see,2496.794,2.202
prompt them to ask additional questions.,2498.996,3.704
But that&amp;#39;s part of providing it to them.,2502.7,1.935
It&amp;#39;s an ongoing review.,2504.635,1.568
And what we want is for them to see these,2506.203,2.87
"materials and come to conclusions, or need more",2509.073,3.537
information to come to conclusions.,2512.61,1.868
But this is part of that review process.,2514.478,1.735
The Press: Are they allowed to -- the type,2516.213,3.604
"of briefing, with their ranking and who they",2519.817,1.935
"are -- no matter if they may be head of the Intel Committee,",2521.752,4.705
are some of these other members allowed to see the same,2526.457,2.135
things that he sees?,2528.592,1.468
"Even though they are not head of -- I mean,",2530.06,2.303
are they allowed to see that?,2532.363,1.535
Mr. Spicer: My understanding would be that they would.,2533.898,1.001
The Press: Okay.,2534.899,1.067
"And lastly, Sean, do you know who allowed",2535.966,2.269
him to come in?,2538.235,1.101
Mr. Spicer: No.,2539.336,0.968
The Press: You don&amp;#39;t know?,2540.304,0.867
Mr. Spicer: No.,2541.171,0.835
Kaitlan.,2542.006,1.001
The Press: I have two questions for you.,2543.007,1.067
"One is, has anyone in the White House ever raised",2544.074,2.803
the possibility of a Cabinet position or a top,2546.877,3.27
intelligence post later on in the administration,2550.147,2.77
for Devin Nunes?,2552.917,1.234
Mr. Spicer: Not that I&amp;#39;m aware.,2554.151,1.335
"The Press: And secondly, will the President hold",2555.486,1.902
a press conference so he can answer questions,2557.388,1.735
on the surveillance claims and all these intelligence,2559.123,2.235
revelations himself?,2561.358,1.168
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not good enough?,2562.526,1.235
"The Press: Not that you&amp;#39;re not good enough, but he&amp;#39;s",2563.761,1.601
the one who made the claims.,2565.362,0.868
"You didn&amp;#39;t make the claims, he made the claims.",2566.23,3.203
Mr. Spicer: I will convey your request to him.,2569.433,1.768
"I know that as I&amp;#39;ve said before, we&amp;#39;ll see.",2571.201,2.103
I&amp;#39;m sure that at some point -- he enjoyed,2573.304,1.735
the last one so much --,2575.039,0.967
The Press: Tomorrow?,2576.006,1.101
"Mr. Spicer: Is that what you&amp;#39;d like, tomorrow?",2577.107,1.135
The Press: That works.,2578.242,1.134
Mr. Spicer: Does that work for you?,2579.376,0.935
(Laughter.),2580.311,0.967
"Okay, well, let me see what I can come up with.",2581.278,1.201
Cecilia.,2582.479,1.368
"The Press: I just want to clarify, do you believe --",2583.847,1.469
"from what you know about these materials, do they",2585.316,1.301
validate the President&amp;#39;s wiretapped claim?,2586.617,2.002
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know.,2588.619,0.967
I have not seen the materials.,2589.586,1.769
It is members of the National Security Committee,2591.355,2.102
who have come across these documents,2593.457,1.168
that want to make them available to the members,2594.625,2.369
who are leading the review.,2596.994,1.134
The Press: And why not just be more forthcoming,2598.128,3.003
about this entire process of who let Nunes in?,2601.131,5.94
If this was enough -- if the President,2607.071,2.969
of the United States could tweet this claim about,2610.04,2.569
"wiretapping, doesn&amp;#39;t the American public have",2612.609,2.37
a right to know more?,2614.979,0.4
"Mr. Spicer: Yes, they do.",2615.379,1.501
And I think that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re going through a process.,2616.88,2.636
And I say this respectfully -- I,2619.516,1.669
understand that you want all the process answers --,2621.185,3.236
"what day did they come in, what were they wearing,",2624.421,1.936
what door did they come in.,2626.357,1.034
The relevant questions are about the substance of this.,2627.391,3.203
And it&amp;#39;s interesting -- I don&amp;#39;t get the same thing,2630.594,3.804
when I see these unpublished stories,2634.398,1.468
with anonymous sources.,2635.866,0.901
"You don&amp;#39;t ever tell me who your sources were, who --",2636.767,2.769
The Press: Because you&amp;#39;re --,2639.536,1.135
"Mr. Spicer: Glenn, I&amp;#39;m actually asking Cecilia&amp;#39;s question --",2640.671,1.668
if you could be as polite as not to interrupt her.,2642.339,2.069
The Press: I&amp;#39;m sorry.,2644.408,0.767
Mr. Spicer: Thank you.,2645.175,0.935
Do you accept his apology?,2646.11,1.001
The Press: One hundred percent.,2647.111,1.368
(Laughter.),2648.479,1.067
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s very --,2649.546,1.068
"The Press: In fact, I will cede the floor to Glenn.",2650.614,1.068
Mr. Spicer: Thank you.,2651.682,0.967
"That&amp;#39;s not how it works, though.",2652.649,1.802
But I would argue that you guys have -- when you,2654.451,2.603
"write a story, and you call and say, I have four",2657.054,2.302
"anonymous sources that say whatever, and I say, okay,",2659.356,1.769
"well, who are the sources and where are they coming",2661.125,1.701
"-- you go, sorry, I&amp;#39;m not revealing anything to you,",2662.826,1.769
but the substance that I&amp;#39;m asking you to respond to --,2664.595,2.569
"well, when the shoe is on the other foot, you&amp;#39;re",2667.164,1.802
all about the process.,2668.966,1.268
The bottom line is that there are two,2670.234,1.935
congressional committees that are conducting,2672.169,2.202
"reviews of this situation, and those committees",2674.371,2.603
are looking at the relevant information and talking,2676.974,1.768
to the relevant people.,2678.742,1.735
"To your point about the process, we have made",2680.477,2.369
individuals available and encouraged individuals,2682.846,2.236
to testify or to meet with or to discuss that,2685.082,4.905
have been approached.,2689.987,1.268
So I think that what we are doing is frankly --,2691.255,1.968
"and I know you probably disagree, but I think we",2693.223,1.902
are doing the responsible thing by making sure that,2695.125,2.336
documents and materials are shown to people with,2697.461,2.302
the appropriate classifications,2699.763,1.368
"in the appropriate settings, and that the people",2701.131,2.436
that the different committees would like to discuss,2703.567,2.769
these matters with are made available to them.,2706.336,1.969
I think that&amp;#39;s the responsible way of handling this.,2708.305,5.839
"The Press: Sean, thank you very much.",2714.144,1.535
"I have two questions, one on Venezuela and another one",2715.679,2.302
on climate policy.,2717.981,1.702
"With respect to Venezuela, because today the Supreme Court",2719.683,3.771
of Venezuela said they would take -- try to,2723.454,3.203
take over the Congress powers and the opposition,2726.657,2.402
said a coup is underway.,2729.059,2.169
Do you consider there is a coup underway in,2731.228,2.202
"Venezuela, and what can we expect the United States to do?",2733.43,4.471
"And the other question is on climate change, because",2737.901,2.87
President Obama signed also the bilateral climate,2740.771,3.97
"deals with Brazil, China and India.",2744.741,4.605
And what do you have to those?,2749.346,1.969
"Mr. Spicer: Well, on the first one, respectfully,",2751.315,3.537
I would send you to the -- I would refer you,2754.852,1.468
to the State Department.,2756.32,1.168
The only Supreme Court I&amp;#39;m really focused on right now,2757.488,1.901
is ours and getting Judge Neil Gorsuch,2759.389,2.136
confirmed by the Senate.,2761.525,2.069
"So, I&amp;#39;d be glad -- I think the State Department",2763.594,1.568
is more of an appropriate venue to discuss,2765.162,2.302
the activities over there.,2767.464,1.402
"And second, I think when it comes to things like",2768.866,4.237
"the Paris treaty, as I mentioned at the outset,",2773.103,3.037
that is being --,2776.14,1.701
The Press: Those are separate --,2777.841,1.302
"Mr. Spicer: I understand, but I think that there are things",2779.143,1.701
that we will have updates for on all of these things,2780.844,3.203
as we move forward.,2784.047,1.368
"Right now, I&amp;#39;ve got nothing on that subject.",2785.415,1.502
Yes.,2786.917,1.168
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",2788.085,0.967
The Wall Street Journal reported this morning,2789.052,1.368
that the Trump administration is proposing more modest,2790.42,2.703
changes to NAFTA.,2793.123,1.335
"Like, for example, they&amp;#39;re leaving the arbitration",2794.458,1.601
"panel that deals with trade disputes in place,",2796.059,1.869
"et cetera, et cetera.",2797.928,1.268
Is the White House backing away from some of the more sweeping,2799.196,4.738
changes to NAFTA that the President proposed,2803.934,2.803
during the campaign? Mr. Spicer: I would just argue that Robert Lighthizer,2806.737,4.037
isn&amp;#39;t even nominated yet.,2810.774,1.568
That is not a statement of administration policy,2812.342,2.369
at this point.,2814.711,1.035
There is nothing in those documents that we are confirming,2815.746,3.069
"-- or in that report, rather, that we are confirming.",2818.815,2.57
That is not a statement of administration policy.,2821.385,2.335
That is not an accurate assessment of where,2823.72,1.969
we are at this time.,2825.689,0.868
And I think our goal is to get Robert Lighthizer,2826.557,4.27
"appointed as the next ambassador and U.S. Trade Representative,",2830.827,3.337
and then when we have that we will have plenty of updates,2834.164,2.436
on where we go with respect to NAFTA and the rest,2836.6,1.635
of our trade agreement.,2838.235,1.301
"With that, I&amp;#39;m going to say goodbye.",2839.536,2.236
I will see you tomorrow.,2841.772,0.901
"Thank you -- oh, I&amp;#39;m sorry, I promised two days",2842.673,2.369
in a row.,2845.042,1.134
The Press: Thank you.,2846.176,1.068
I&amp;#39;ve got one on foreign policy and one on domestic policy.,2847.244,2.035
"First one is, many Republicans were very critical about how",2849.279,3.17
President Obama had handled the Iranian Green Revolution,2852.449,2.669
about six years ago.,2855.118,1.168
"So, my question is, if mass protests across",2856.286,2.102
"Russia develop into a movement, is this",2858.388,2.303
something that -- what does the administration,2860.691,2.135
feel its role should be regarding that?,2862.826,3.137
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to -- that&amp;#39;s a,2865.963,0.8
hypothetical question to talk about what would,2866.763,2.503
happen and if --,2869.266,0.834
"The Press: No, it&amp;#39;s not --",2870.1,1.435
"Mr. Spicer: I know, but when it comes to protests we obviously",2871.535,3.77
"encourage, as we did last Sunday, the peaceful protest --",2875.305,3.671
the government of Russia to allow the peaceful,2878.976,1.468
protest of individuals throughout their country.,2880.444,2.903
We obviously support the people to have a voice,2883.347,3.436
in every government throughout the world.,2886.783,1.602
The Press: And on the subject of partisanship,2888.385,1.335
"and obstructionism, whose responsibility does the",2889.72,3.403
President feel it is to put an end,2893.123,2.769
to partisanship?,2895.892,1.502
And who needs to be reaching out to whom collectively?,2897.394,2.769
Mr. Spicer: I think it&amp;#39;s a two-way street.,2900.163,1.535
I think part of it is that we -- the President,2901.698,4.338
and the First Lady extended an invitation the other night,2906.036,2.002
for everyone to come.,2908.038,1.335
I think we were excited to see a third of Senate Democrats come.,2909.373,2.535
I wish we had seen more.,2911.908,1.669
There&amp;#39;s an opportunity I think to engage in,2913.577,1.568
a discussion about some of the issues and come together.,2915.145,2.369
But I would argue that when you look at this,2917.514,3.871
"fight on Gorsuch, there are -- I don&amp;#39;t disagree",2921.385,4.537
with the fact that if you&amp;#39;re a Democrat,2925.922,1.402
you probably don&amp;#39;t necessarily agree with some of the rulings,2927.324,3.403
and some of the philosophies of Judge Gorsuch.,2930.727,1.835
I get that.,2932.562,0.968
"But at the end of the day, they have always agreed --",2933.53,3.103
"in fact, in most cases, the filibuster",2936.633,1.969
has never been the norm.,2938.602,2.102
It hasn&amp;#39;t.,2940.704,1.168
And it is odd to see that these individuals who have,2941.872,3.537
-- it&amp;#39;s one thing to vote no; it&amp;#39;s one thing to say,2945.409,2.335
that we don&amp;#39;t agree.,2947.744,1.135
But to now turn to filibustering or threatening to filibuster,2948.879,3.47
"Senate -- unbelievably qualified people, and there is nobody",2952.349,4.338
"that I&amp;#39;m aware of, even on the left, that is suggesting",2956.687,3.003
that Judge Gorsuch isn&amp;#39;t qualified to serve,2959.69,2.202
as a Supreme Court justice.,2961.892,1.568
Republicans in the past have allowed Democrat,2963.46,3.804
Presidents to have their nominees voted on up or,2967.264,2.702
"down, and for the most part, when you go back to",2969.966,1.902
"President Obama, President Clinton, they have been --",2971.868,4.004
Republicans have joined with Democrats to allow,2975.872,1.335
people who are qualified to go onto the Court.,2977.207,2.236
And to see this new precedent be formed by,2979.443,3.336
Leader Schumer is disappointing because,2982.779,2.403
"this is a huge, huge crack.",2985.182,1.368
I think there was a column -- one of the papers today,2986.55,2.269
I think -- you are really fundamentally changing how,2988.819,3.069
the Senate is going to operate by doing this.,2991.888,1.735
And I think that&amp;#39;s an important -- they can,2993.623,3.304
"disagree with him philosophically, I get that.",2996.927,1.935
But when you have an election you can assume,2998.862,2.769
that a Republican President is going,3001.631,2.103
to choose Republicans for appointments and for,3003.734,4.237
"federal judgeships, and the Democrats will do the",3007.971,2.436
same with their time in office.,3010.407,2.636
"But it was Obama&amp;#39;s nominees that got through,",3013.043,4.805
all with Republican support.,3017.848,1.835
And it&amp;#39;s difficult to understand why when you&amp;#39;ve,3019.683,3.737
"got someone as eminently qualified as Gorsuch,",3023.42,2.302
that this is the state that they want to drive.,3025.722,1.502
And I think it further sets a partisan divide,3027.224,2.569
in our country when we can&amp;#39;t allow people who are,3029.793,3.537
qualified and universally so to get on the bench.,3033.33,4.638
The Press: Should it not be done from the President&amp;#39;s side,3037.968,1.768
to try to --,3039.736,1.135
"Mr. Spicer: I think so, sure.",3040.871,1.101
But I think it&amp;#39;s a two-way street.,3041.972,1.268
"I would ask you what is -- I remember a few years ago,",3043.24,4.471
"there was all this talk about, from the get-go,",3047.711,1.935
of Obama -- Democrats made hay about how they wanted,3049.646,2.536
to see him as a one-term President.,3052.182,2.302
I&amp;#39;ve seen a similar tactic from Democrats now about,3054.484,2.836
"how they want to defeat him, they want to stop",3057.32,1.702
"his agenda, and there&amp;#39;s no sense of them wanting to",3059.022,3.103
work with this President.,3062.125,0.868
"So, at some point, I think we have shown",3062.993,2.269
a willingness to bring them together.,3065.262,2.235
"It&amp;#39;s amazing how many senators, when you talk",3067.497,2.269
"to them over the course of the last almost 70 days,",3069.766,4.138
"have said, you know, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve been to the White House",3073.904,1.501
more in the last 70 days of a Trump administration,3075.405,3.07
than I was during eight years of an Obama administration.&amp;quot;,3078.475,2.569
And I think that that speaks to the President&amp;#39;s,3081.044,1.802
desire to bring people together and to find,3082.846,2.903
common ground on areas of mutual agreement where we,3085.749,2.135
can move the country forward.,3087.884,0.901
Thank you.,3088.785,0.834
I&amp;#39;ll see you tomorrow.,3089.619,2.169
