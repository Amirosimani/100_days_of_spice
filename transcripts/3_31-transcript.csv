Mr. Spicer: Good afternoon.,0,1.701
"First off, I want to catch everyone up who wasn&amp;#39;t",1.701,5.005
able to make the briefing last night on the,8.842,1.601
executive orders on the trade -- executive orders,10.443,3.437
that the President is going to be signing,13.88,1.568
this afternoon.,15.448,0.668
The first order directs the Department of Commerce,16.116,2.168
and the Office of the U.S.,18.284,0.801
Trade Representative to examine every form of,19.085,3.504
trade abuse and non-reciprocal practice,22.589,2.803
that are currently contributing to the United,25.392,1.634
"States&amp;#39; large and persistent trade deficit,",27.026,2.737
which was the largest of any major nation in 2016,29.763,3.87
at $500 billion.,33.633,1.535
"Within 90 days, the Department of",35.168,2.636
Commerce and U.S.,37.804,1.535
Trade Representative will submit a comprehensive,39.339,2.335
report to the President on the causes of our,41.674,2.803
unduly large deficit.,44.477,2.236
It&amp;#39;s the first time in modern history that an,46.713,1.668
American President has called for such an,48.381,1.802
"investigation, and its -- our findings will allow us",50.183,3.437
to make smarter decisions on behalf of the American,53.62,3.303
people about our trade policy of our country,56.923,2.736
going forward.,59.659,1.135
"That&amp;#39;s why the AFL-CIO, United Steelworkers",60.794,2.702
"International, the International Association",63.496,2.336
of Machinists and the Aerospace Workers,65.832,2.769
International all came out today to,68.601,1.569
applaud the order.,70.17,1.501
The second order addresses the current lack of,71.671,2.77
enforcement of one of our strongest tools in,74.441,2.035
fighting unfair trade practices --,76.476,3.303
countervailing duties.,79.779,0.968
Countervailing duties were put in place to address,80.747,3.303
the problem of other countries dumping,84.05,2.302
"undervalued goods into American markets, making",86.352,3.37
it impossible for American businesses to compete with,89.722,2.803
artificially low prices.,92.525,2.069
This is especially a problem in countries whose,94.594,1.969
governments subsidize exports into our country.,96.563,3.37
"So to discourage this practice, the U.S.",99.933,1.768
Customs and Border Protection Agency has a,101.701,2.87
mechanism for assessing these type of transactions,104.571,2.469
"and imposing financial penalties, known as",107.04,2.869
"countervailing duties, when it&amp;#39;s determined that",109.909,2.436
this kind of malicious dumping has occurred.,112.345,2.503
"Since 2001, the U.S.",114.848,1.701
Customs and Border Protection Agency has not,116.549,2.67
collected over $2.8 billion in these duties.,119.219,4.204
"If you think about it, we could do a lot by",123.423,2.369
maximizing this enforcement power,125.792,1.702
for our country.,127.494,1.167
So we need to do a better job on behalf of,128.661,1.869
the American worker.,130.53,1.301
"If a foreign company, often due to its being",131.831,2.87
partly or entirely government-run or,134.701,1.735
"subsidized, is able to flood American markets",136.436,2.769
"with an artificially cheap steel, for example, they",139.205,3.003
price American companies out of the system.,142.208,2.803
Say you&amp;#39;re the owner of a steel company in Ohio.,145.011,2.402
You can&amp;#39;t compete with some of these,147.413,1.402
below-market prices.,148.815,1.168
So you have to find other ways to meet your bottom,149.983,1.968
"line, like closing a factory and laying off",151.951,2.369
"workers, or might entirely having to",154.32,1.835
close down entirely.,156.155,1.769
By not properly using this enforcement mechanism,157.924,2.836
we&amp;#39;re costing Americans who work in so many,160.76,2.536
"industries -- not just steel, but in agriculture,",163.296,2.569
"chemicals, machinery, and other manufactured good in",165.865,3.003
particular President Trump was elected to do,168.868,2.736
everything he can to support American workers,171.604,1.936
and American manufacturers.,173.54,1.735
"Together, these two executive orders are a",175.275,2.369
significant step in accomplishing the,177.644,1.801
President&amp;#39;s promise to end unfair trade practices,179.445,4.038
once and for all.,183.483,1.435
"Also, yesterday, we were pleased to see that",184.918,2.102
Senators Manchin of West Virginia and Heitkamp,187.02,2.335
announce their support for Judge Neil Gorsuch.,189.355,3.771
And Senator Claire McCaskill conceded at a,193.126,1.768
private event that among the list of potential,194.894,1.869
nominees that the President released during,196.763,2.202
"a campaign, Judge Gorsuch was -- according to her,",198.965,2.669
quote -- &amp;quot;one of the better ones.&amp;quot;,201.634,2.069
We hope that her praise leads to additional,203.703,1.869
support -- and her support.,205.572,1.968
It&amp;#39;s hard to find any reason except for,207.54,1.902
obstructionism to see why fellow Democrats in her,209.442,3.07
caucus have not been able to join them.,212.512,2.702
"As I said yesterday, Judge Gorsuch is highly",215.214,2.169
"regarded, having received a rating of &amp;quot;well",217.383,1.969
"qualified&amp;quot; from the American Bar Association,",219.352,3.904
and has demonstrated an unparalleled and,223.256,2.769
"unprecedented level of transparency, including",226.025,2.803
"the release of over 75,000 pages of documents,",228.828,3.07
fielding nearly 300 questions from Senate,231.898,2.369
"Democrats on the committee, and 70 pages of",234.267,2.736
"written answers about his personal records, and has",237.003,2.703
demonstrated a mainstream judicial record -- with,239.706,2.802
nearly all of the decisions being joined by,242.508,1.869
Democrat-appointed judges.,244.377,1.969
"Without a clear justification, Senate",246.346,1.668
"Democrats have fudged the facts on recent history,",248.014,2.269
to try to mislead the American people about,250.283,2.135
"their unprecedented obstructionism,",252.418,2.036
essentially claiming a non-existent,254.454,1.701
60-vote standard.,256.155,1.802
"As I&amp;#39;ve said before, should Senate Minority",257.957,2.302
"Leader Chuck Schumer get his way, this would be the",260.259,2.136
first successful filibuster of a nominee to,262.395,2.102
join the Supreme Court.,264.497,1.535
This would make history in a very bad way.,266.032,3.236
They&amp;#39;ve also forgotten their own words.,269.268,1.635
I&amp;#39;ve cited previously this week the rhetoric of,270.903,2.837
"Senator Schumer, Democratic nominee Hillary",273.74,1.935
"Clinton, the regrets of invoking the filibuster by",275.675,3.17
"Senator -- President Obama, then Senator Obama,",278.845,2.936
"and the words of many other Senate Democrats,",281.781,2.269
"like Senator McCaskill, on why blocking a vote for a",284.05,2.869
judge having gone through the process has no,286.919,2.436
precedent and is irresponsible.,289.355,1.669
Let me cite one more argument that many Senate,291.024,3.303
Democrats have recently made.,294.327,1.301
Current members of the Senate seem to also reject,295.628,2.202
the notion of a Supreme Court operating with,297.83,2.236
"eight, not nine, justices.",300.066,1.368
"These include Senators Schumer, Dick Durbin,",301.434,2.369
"Bernie Sanders, Dianne Feinstein, Jeanne Shaheen,",303.803,2.903
"Richard Blumenthal, Amy Klobuchar, Ben Cardin and",306.706,2.869
Martin Heinrich.,309.575,1.068
Each of these Senate Democrats and the rest of,310.643,1.769
their fellow caucus members need not listen to,312.412,1.668
"me or the President, but their own words as",314.08,2.269
recently as last year.,316.349,1.068
The President told the American people in his,317.417,2.168
Weekly Address that was launched earlier,319.585,1.669
today why it is.,321.254,2.035
"And again, we call on Senate Democrats to end",323.289,2.202
this unnecessary obstruction and confirm an,325.491,2.703
imminently qualified jurist to the bench.,328.194,2.402
"Also last night, the Department of Justice",330.596,1.735
filed an appeal in the 9th Circuit to Hawaii&amp;#39;s,332.331,3.371
federal judge&amp;#39;s preliminary injunction,335.702,1.501
against the President&amp;#39;s lawful and necessary,337.203,2.369
executive order dealing with protecting,339.572,2.102
this country.,341.674,1.001
Moving on to some of the events of today.,342.675,1.435
"This morning, the President met with former",344.11,2.469
Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice.,346.579,1.635
They had an opportunity to talk about regional,348.214,2.336
"threats, current affairs hotspots, our attempt to",350.55,5.005
"defeat ISIS, and many more areas.",355.555,2.636
It was a great meeting where they discussed many,358.191,2.435
of the challenges facing our country.,360.626,2.636
And the President sought the former Secretary of,363.262,2.436
State and National Security Advisor&amp;#39;s advice,365.698,1.935
and opinions on a variety of subjects.,367.633,2.436
"He also signed House Joint Resolution 42, allowing",370.069,3.404
states to drug test unemployment insurance,373.473,2.302
"claims, and H.R.",375.775,1.368
"1362, naming a VA outpatient clinic in Pago",377.143,3.67
"Pago, American Samoa.",380.813,1.702
"Also this morning, the President joined Jay",382.515,1.668
"Timmons, President of the National Association of",384.183,1.869
"Manufacturers, and some of its member CEOs to unveil",386.052,3.837
the Association&amp;#39;s annual Manufacturers&amp;#39;,389.889,3.003
Outlook Survey.,392.892,1.268
An incredible 93 percent of manufacturers surveyed,394.16,3.27
by the National Association of,397.43,1.601
Manufacturers now have a positive outlook,399.031,2.136
for the future.,401.167,1.034
That&amp;#39;s a 20-year record high that&amp;#39;s more than 35,402.201,3.504
points higher than that same rating was last year.,405.705,3.703
"To quote from the survey itself, &amp;quot;The rising",409.408,2.536
confidence stems from the belief that the new,411.944,1.969
"administration in Washington, D.C. will",413.913,2.236
"bring much needed regulatory relief, as well",416.149,2.535
as reforms to the tax code and a significant,418.684,3.404
infrastructure package.&amp;quot;,422.088,1.868
The optimism is evident across the spectrum of,423.956,2.203
indicators.,426.159,0.9
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up over 12,427.059,2.103
percent since Election Day.,429.162,1.635
The National Association of Home Builders,430.797,1.735
Confidence Index is at its highest level in 12 years.,432.532,3.737
The Gallup Small Business Index shows that small,436.269,2.335
business owners are the most optimistic they&amp;#39;ve,438.604,2.102
been since 2007.,440.706,2.069
It&amp;#39;s not surprising that American industry is,442.775,2.036
reacting in this way.,444.811,1.368
The President has taken immediate steps to make it,446.179,2.135
easier to do business in this country.,448.314,2.002
And we are just at the beginning of this process.,450.316,2.636
On top of the significant steps taken in the,452.952,2.002
"executive orders this morning, he&amp;#39;s also",454.954,1.969
withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership,456.923,2.002
"trade agreement, cleared the way for the Keystone",458.925,2.102
"XL and Dakota Access pipelines, began a much",461.027,3.336
needed government-wide reform of our regulatory,464.363,2.436
"and permitting processes, and signed legislation",466.799,2.703
preventing the burdensome streamline -- &amp;quot;Stream,469.502,2.002
Protection Rule&amp;quot; from causing further harm to,471.504,2.302
America&amp;#39;s coal industry.,473.806,1.602
The President was glad to see this report add to the,475.408,1.768
list of measurements reflecting the incredible,477.176,2.202
optimism and positivity that his pro-growth,479.378,2.102
policies have created.,481.48,2.236
Back to this afternoon.,483.716,1.135
The President will meet with the Director of the,484.851,1.434
National Institutes of Health before signing the,486.285,2.57
aforementioned executive orders on trade,488.855,1.801
at 3:30 p.m.,490.656,1.468
And he will meet with Director of the Office of,492.124,2.002
Management and Budget Mick Mulvaney.,494.126,3.404
"In Cabinet news today, the Secretary of State, Rex",497.53,2.736
"Tillerson, is in Brussels, attending the NATO Foreign",500.266,2.536
Ministers Meeting.,502.802,1.168
"There, he reaffirmed the Trump administration&amp;#39;s",503.97,2.068
steadfast commitment to NATO.,506.038,1.869
Secretary Tillerson also stressed the need for all,507.907,2.736
member countries to meet their defense spending,510.643,2.069
"commitments, as well as the need for NATO to take",512.712,2.369
a larger role in the fight against,515.081,2.435
terrorism and ISIS.,517.516,1.202
The President looks forward to meeting with,518.718,1.635
his NATO counterparts in Brussels this May to,520.353,2.469
reaffirm the United States&amp;#39; commitment to NATO,522.822,3.136
and to discuss ways to strengthen the alliance in,525.958,2.636
order to cope with challenges in national and,528.594,2.503
international security.,531.097,1.468
"This morning, the Office of the United States Trade",532.565,1.802
Representative released the 2017,534.367,2.669
National Trade Estimate.,537.036,1.435
"The annual report, which is required by law,",538.471,2.002
surveys the significant barriers faced by,540.473,2.702
American exporters.,543.175,1.602
Its findings reinforce the need for the President&amp;#39;s,544.777,2.469
"&amp;quot;America First&amp;quot; trade agenda, which prioritizes",547.246,2.87
the enforcement of the trade laws to protect,550.116,2.302
American workers and job creators.,552.418,2.035
The President looks forward to having,554.453,1.368
Ambassador Lighthizer in place as the USTR so that,555.821,2.837
he can begin his important work in earnest and,558.658,2.102
fulfill the mission of this report.,560.76,1.334
"And Transportation Secretary Chao -- who,",562.094,3.103
"yesterday, celebrated the 50th birthday of the",565.197,2.503
Department of Transportation -- today,567.7,1.902
directed the Federal Highway Administration,569.602,1.935
officials to award $10 million in Emergency,571.537,2.636
Relief funds to help begin repairs on Atlanta&amp;#39;s,574.173,2.87
collapsed I-85 Overpass.,577.043,2.802
Releasing these funds will quickly help to ensure,579.845,2.736
that the bridge is repaired safely and,582.581,2.036
in a timely manner.,584.617,1.368
The White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs,585.985,1.735
has already talked with the Georgia Governor&amp;#39;s,587.72,1.501
team and Secretary Chao has spoken,589.221,3.037
with the Governor.,592.258,1.568
"Looking forward -- as promised, today we will be",593.826,1.535
releasing the U.S.,595.361,1.268
OGE Form 378 financial reports as filed by,596.629,4.137
commissioned officers here in the White House.,600.766,2.336
Right after I&amp;#39;m done here we&amp;#39;ll have a background,603.102,1.835
briefing with Senior White House compliance and,604.937,1.835
ethics officers to walk you through how that,606.772,2.703
process is going to go and the public release of that,609.475,2.736
"information, which will occur later this evening.",612.211,2.503
We&amp;#39;ll be sure to update you if there&amp;#39;s anything,614.714,1.501
further to add.,616.215,1.368
"This weekend, the President will be here in",617.583,2.302
the White House holding meetings.,619.885,1.602
We&amp;#39;ll be sure to update you if there&amp;#39;s anything,621.487,2.202
further to add.,623.689,1.268
"And on Sunday, the White House will honor World",624.957,2.936
Autism Awareness Day by lighting the White House,627.893,3.003
in blue to join with the autism,630.896,1.602
awareness community.,632.498,1.735
Further research into the causes and treatments for,634.233,2.77
autism spectrum disorders is one of the,637.003,1.634
President&amp;#39;s priorities.,638.637,1.469
"As we light it blue on Sunday, the White House",640.106,2.102
will be celebrating all of the individuals and,642.208,3.336
families whose lives are impacted by autism.,645.544,3.437
I would note that it&amp;#39;s a really interesting story,648.981,2.469
how this came to be.,651.45,1.702
"The head of Autism Speaks, an organization that has",653.152,2.302
"done tremendous work with this, Bob Wright is one of",655.454,2.369
the cofounders -- is a longtime friend,657.823,2.403
of the President.,660.226,0.834
"His wife, Suzanne, was struggling with pancreatic",661.06,4.972
cancer last year.,666.032,1.401
And the President made a pledge to her.,667.433,1.735
"He said, if I&amp;#39;m elected President, in supporting",669.168,2.502
"this cause that you care so deeply about, I will",671.67,2.036
light the White House blue.,673.706,1.535
So it is in Suzanne and Bob Wright&amp;#39;s honor that,675.241,3.837
this will occur for this great cause.,679.078,3.737
And I hope Bob knows that Suzanne is looking down,682.815,3.036
proudly to see that that pledge has been fulfilled.,685.851,3.37
"With that, I&amp;#39;ll be glad to take your questions.",689.221,2.436
John Roberts.,691.657,0.667
"The Press: Sean, a couple of questions, if I could,",692.324,3.971
about Chairman Nunes&amp;#39;s visit to the White House.,696.295,3.57
Fox News has been told by intelligence officials,699.865,2.67
that Chairman Nunes is aware of who did the,702.535,2.469
unmasking of certain individuals in the,705.004,2.502
transition and may be aware of who ordered the,707.506,3.237
unmasking of those individuals.,710.743,1.835
Is the White House aware of that information?,712.578,1.802
"Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know what he knows, in the",714.38,4.071
"sense that that&amp;#39;s -- and again, I&amp;#39;ve tried to make",718.451,2.902
it a comment not to get into the specifics,721.353,3.471
of that report.,724.824,1.768
I will not -- I think it&amp;#39;s not in our interest to,726.592,3.737
talk about the process.,730.329,1.001
What occurred between Chairman Nunes in coming,731.33,2.169
here was both routine and proper.,733.499,2.803
"Chairman Nunes and Ranking Member Schiff, who I",736.302,1.701
"understand is expected here later today, both",738.003,3.604
possess the appropriate credentials,741.607,2.069
and clearances.,743.676,0.967
"We&amp;#39;ve invited Democrats here, and I&amp;#39;ve been told",744.643,2.436
that material they will see will shed light,747.079,1.735
on the investigation.,748.814,1.001
I know a lot of folks want to talk about the process,749.815,2.469
and not the surveillance and the underlying issue,752.284,2.469
of the substance -- the unmasking and leaks is,754.753,2.737
what we should all be concerned about.,757.49,1.568
"It affects all Americans, our liberties, our",759.058,2.669
"freedom, our civil liberties.",761.727,2.302
So let&amp;#39;s talk about some of the substance.,764.029,1.769
"And I know that&amp;#39;s not -- but on March 2nd, day",765.798,2.636
"before the President&amp;#39;s tweet, comments by a",768.434,2.202
"senior administration official, foreign policy",770.636,2.469
"expert, Dr. Evelyn Farkas, together with previous",773.105,2.836
"reports that have been out, raised serious",775.941,1.502
concerns on whether or not there was an organized and,777.443,2.569
widespread effort by the Obama administration to,780.012,3.17
use and leak highly sensitive intelligence,783.182,2.402
information for political purposes.,785.584,1.936
She admitted this on television by saying: &amp;quot;I,787.52,1.935
"was urging my former colleagues, frankly",789.455,1.935
"speaking, the people on the Hill; I was telling",791.39,2.302
"people on the Hill, get as much information as you",793.692,2.203
"can, get as much intelligence as you can.",795.895,2.302
I had a fear that they were essentially watching,798.197,2.436
"the Trump staff, and he was worried about the",800.633,1.568
Trump administration.&amp;quot;,802.201,1.435
That&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s out there.,803.636,0.8
And I know NBC News has just reported something,804.436,2.369
very similar about information that was used,806.805,2.77
by the Obama White House to spread this information,809.575,3.303
-- this politically sensitive information.,812.878,2.469
Dr. Farkas&amp;#39;s admissions alone are devastating.,815.347,4.972
"On March 4th, the President -- as you all",820.319,1.869
know -- raised serious questions about,822.188,1.401
"surveillance practices by the Obama administration,",823.589,2.736
including whether or not the President-elect or the,826.325,1.935
transition team members were being improperly,828.26,2.369
monitored for political purposes under the,830.629,2.469
Obama administration.,833.098,0.968
"Later in March, in the ordinary course of their",834.066,2.169
"work, NSC -- National Security Council staff",836.235,2.97
discovered information that may support the,839.205,2.469
questions raised by the President and,841.674,2.235
Dr. Farkas&amp;#39;s claim.,843.909,1.769
These are serious issues.,845.678,1.735
They raise serious concerns.,847.413,1.635
"And if true, the issues would be devastating.",849.048,2.469
We&amp;#39;re committed to working with the House and Senate,851.517,1.735
"committees, as we&amp;#39;ve said multiple times, to get to",853.252,2.602
"the bottom of what happened here, why it",855.854,1.936
"happened, and who was involved.",857.79,1.868
"For this reason, we&amp;#39;re in the process of ensuring",859.658,1.969
that the reports that the NSC staff discovered in,861.627,3.003
the normal course of business are made,864.63,1.768
available to those committees investigating,866.398,2.203
to ensure that all of the facts come to light.,868.601,2.035
And if everyone was treating the President and,870.636,2.469
"the administration fairly, you&amp;#39;d ask a series of much",873.105,2.569
different questions about the substance,875.674,2.069
than the materials.,877.743,1.702
"As we&amp;#39;ve said before, when you talk about Russia in",879.445,2.402
"particular, everyone who has been briefed on this",881.847,2.436
"subject from Republican, to Democrat, to CIA,",884.283,3.303
"former Obama administration&amp;#39;s Clapper,",887.586,2.236
"Brennan, you name it -- all of the people come",889.822,2.869
back with the same conclusion -- and I think,892.691,2.036
that is important -- that there has been no evidence,894.727,1.968
of the President&amp;#39;s campaign and,896.695,1.168
Russian officials.,897.863,1.201
"In fact, as you&amp;#39;ve heard me state before, it was",899.064,1.869
Hillary Clinton who was the architect of the last,900.933,2.369
administration&amp;#39;s failed reset policy.,903.302,2.636
She told Russian state TV that it was designed,905.938,2.602
to strengthen Russia.,908.54,1.402
That was their goal: t strengthen Russia.,909.942,2.369
She used her office to make concession after,912.311,2.269
"concession, selling off one-fifth of our country&amp;#39;s",914.58,2.869
"uranium, paid speeches, paid deals, getting",917.449,3.337
personal calls from Vladimir Putin.,920.786,2.102
I think if there&amp;#39;s -- you really want to talk about,922.888,1.969
"a Russian connection and the substance, that&amp;#39;s",924.857,2.569
where we should be looking.,927.426,1.535
That -- not there.,928.961,1.068
The Press: I wasn&amp;#39;t expecting to tap quite,930.029,2.636
such a deep well with that question.,932.665,2.936
(Laughter.),935.601,0.667
Mr. Spicer: It&amp;#39;s Friday.,936.268,0.901
The Press: Intelligence officials also tell us,937.169,2.369
that Chairman Nunes knew about the documents that,939.538,3.27
"he viewed at the White House back in January, but",942.808,3.637
ended up looking at them at the NSC SCIF only,946.445,3.27
because he could not get access to those same,949.715,2.035
documents through some of the other,951.75,1.669
intelligence agencies.,953.419,1.034
Basically it was a last resort to come here to the,954.453,2.703
White House to view them.,957.156,0.934
Do you know if that is the case?,958.09,1.368
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t.,959.458,0.667
But I do think that it tracks everything that&amp;#39;s,960.125,1.902
been -- I saw a couple tweets the other day that,962.027,3.404
I mentioned where people were saying that the NSA,965.431,1.868
was trying to get documents.,967.299,1.602
From a narrative of what&amp;#39;s been out there -- and,968.901,2.602
"again, we have tried to be very careful about this",971.503,3.637
and tried to be consistent about how we,975.14,1.735
want this handled.,976.875,0.734
But everything that he has said -- when he came out,977.609,3.804
"initially and talked to the media, he made it very",981.413,1.869
clear that he had been looking into this.,983.282,1.935
He had stated this much earlier than the President,985.217,2.336
ever had raised this issue about surveillance and the,987.553,2.536
unmasking of individuals for areas that had nothing,990.089,3.103
to do with Russia and nothing to do with,993.192,5.372
substantive intelligence surveillance.,998.564,1.868
"So I think that as we continue down this path,",1000.432,2.236
if you actually begin to focus really on the,1002.668,1.835
"substance, I think we see more and more a very, very",1004.503,3.737
troubling and devastating path.,1008.24,1.435
The Press: And just one more thing to clear up,1009.675,1.435
"on process, if I could.",1011.11,1.601
We&amp;#39;re also being told by intelligence officials,1012.711,2.503
that the two individuals who were identified,1015.214,1.902
yesterday -- Ezra Cohen-Watnick and Michael,1017.116,2.569
Ellis -- were not the source for the,1019.685,2.769
"information, for the intelligence chairman.",1022.454,2.303
They did play an ancillary role in terms of finding,1024.757,3.47
some extra evidence here at the White House and,1028.227,2.736
helping to sign him in so that he could,1030.963,2.702
view the intelligence.,1033.665,0.935
Do you know if that&amp;#39;s true?,1034.6,1.802
"Mr. Spicer: Again, John, I&amp;#39;m not -- if I start",1036.402,2.469
"commenting on every one of these stories, I can&amp;#39;t --",1038.871,2.936
that&amp;#39;s not our practice.,1041.807,2.302
"Again, part of it is that if we confirm some things",1044.109,1.902
and not others we&amp;#39;re going to go down a,1046.011,2.002
very slippery slope.,1048.013,0.667
I can say that we&amp;#39;ve continued to say that this,1048.68,2.136
is -- I think the substance of this matter,1050.816,2.636
and what continues to come to light in terms of Obama,1053.452,2.669
"officials admitting either off the record or,",1056.121,2.803
"frankly, on the record, consistent with what",1058.924,2.369
"Dr. Farkas says, that there was clearly an",1061.293,2.803
attempt to do something politically motivated with,1064.096,2.469
the intelligence out there.,1066.565,0.901
And the question is why?,1067.466,1.501
Who else did it?,1068.967,1.035
Was it ordered?,1070.002,0.667
By whom?,1070.669,1.034
"But I think more and more, the substance that",1071.703,3.471
continues to come out on the record by individuals,1075.174,3.837
continues to point to exactly what the President,1079.011,3.036
was talking about that day on March 5th.,1082.047,2.002
Jonathan.,1084.049,1.435
"The Press: Sean, we heard from the President this",1085.484,1.868
morning saying that Mike Flynn should,1087.352,2.002
ask for immunity.,1089.354,1.969
We also know the President has longstanding views on,1091.323,2.202
what immunity means.,1093.525,0.868
"Back in September he said, &amp;quot;If you aren&amp;#39;t guilty of a",1094.393,3.303
"crime, what do you need immunity for?&amp;quot;",1097.696,2.369
So does the President think that Mike Flynn is,1100.065,2.035
guilty of a crime?,1102.1,0.768
Mr. Spicer: I think he believes that Mike Flynn,1102.868,2.235
should go testify.,1105.103,1.035
He thinks that he should go up there and do what he,1106.138,2.502
has to do to get the story out.,1108.64,1.135
The Press: With or without immunity?,1109.775,1.568
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s up to him and his,1111.343,1.368
lawyer to decide.,1112.711,0.901
I&amp;#39;m not going to give Mike Flynn or anyone else legal,1113.612,3.604
"advice from the podium, but I will tell you that",1117.216,1.868
"the President&amp;#39;s view is he should go up there, he",1119.084,2.269
should testify.,1121.353,0.667
The Press: But the President gave legal,1122.02,1.335
advice from his Twitter account.,1123.355,1.368
He said Mike Flynn should ask for immunity.,1124.723,2.569
"Mr. Spicer: Right, I understand.",1127.292,1.402
The Press: And he has said in the past that the only,1128.694,1.334
reason you ask for immunity if you,1130.028,1.335
committed a crime.,1131.363,0.701
"Mr. Spicer: Right, but I think the underlying point",1132.064,1.334
"that you&amp;#39;re missing, Jonathan, respectfully, is",1133.398,1.335
"that what he&amp;#39;s asking is, go testify, go get it out",1134.733,1.468
"there, do what you have to do to get there and tell",1136.201,2.369
Congress and tell everyone exactly what we&amp;#39;ve been,1138.57,1.602
saying for a long time.,1140.172,1.268
"So I mean, again -- I get your point.",1141.44,2.502
But I think that the interesting thing is you,1143.942,1.602
actually stop for a second and realize what the,1145.544,2.369
"President is doing is that he&amp;#39;s saying, do whatever",1147.913,2.369
"you have to do, to go up to make it clear what",1150.282,2.636
"happened, take whatever precaution you want or",1152.918,2.235
however your legal counsel advises you.,1155.153,2.37
"But again, I&amp;#39;ve heard in some legal circles that",1157.523,1.334
the President could have exerted legal authority,1158.857,1.335
with him and Sally Yates and others.,1160.192,1.335
It&amp;#39;s quite the opposite.,1161.527,0.667
"And again, I think that that, compared to the",1162.194,5.005
narrative that you hear from a lot of the folks in,1169.601,2.102
this room all the time is a little bit opposite.,1171.703,2.403
Here you have a President who is telling Mike Flynn,1174.106,3.103
"and others to go up there, make sure -- in fact, we",1177.209,2.569
talked about the other day with members of the,1179.778,1.368
administration that the President -- we&amp;#39;ve made --,1181.146,2.336
volunteered -- this doesn&amp;#39;t look like an,1183.482,1.334
administration that is not doing everything it can to,1184.816,1.769
get to the bottom of this in the appropriate way.,1186.585,2.269
And I think that that is an important distinction,1188.854,2.335
"that has been lost on a lot of you, that every",1191.189,2.203
action that we have taken -- we&amp;#39;ve got up here and,1193.392,1.768
we&amp;#39;ve talked about Russia and the lack,1195.16,2.236
of a connection.,1197.396,0.667
We&amp;#39;ve talked about the fact that every single,1198.063,1.835
person who&amp;#39;s been briefed has come away saying none,1199.898,2.369
"exists -- Republican, Democrat, Obama appointee,",1202.267,2.736
et cetera.,1205.003,0.734
"And yet, at the end of the day, the narrative",1205.737,1.368
still comes at us.,1207.105,0.701
"And now, we&amp;#39;re going to the point where we&amp;#39;ve",1207.806,1.869
actually encouraged people to go talk to the House,1209.675,2.469
and Senate Intelligence Committee and the,1212.144,1.334
appropriate investigators so that they can continue,1213.478,2.069
to get to the bottom of this and get,1215.547,1.335
it aside from us.,1216.882,0.701
I think that&amp;#39;s quite the opposite of what you would,1217.583,2.102
normally think that somebody who was not,1219.685,2.669
trying to get to the bottom would do.,1222.354,1.368
Eamon.,1223.722,0.667
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1224.389,0.701
"One on taxes and one on trade, if I could.",1225.09,3.303
"Back on February 9th, the President said the he",1228.393,2.57
would be presenting a phenomenal tax plan in the,1230.963,2.736
next two or three weeks.,1233.699,1.534
Tomorrow is April 1st; we haven&amp;#39;t seen,1235.233,2.103
that tax plan.,1237.336,0.934
Can you tell us when the President is going to,1238.27,3.036
present his plan?,1241.306,0.901
"Mr. Spicer: I think, as you noticed -- yesterday",1242.207,2.736
Secretary Mnuchin and Gary Cohn and others on the,1244.943,2.136
team talked to the President about the,1247.079,3.37
"process, and I think that we are working on engaging",1250.449,4.237
with key stakeholders.,1254.686,1.335
And when we feel it&amp;#39;s appropriate that the,1256.021,1.635
President is given the appropriate amount of,1257.656,1.335
"feedback, we&amp;#39;ll start to put out the appropriate",1258.991,2.469
outline and process that we envision.,1261.46,2.636
"But at this time, that discussion is ongoing.",1264.096,2.669
"We recognize, as you know -- we anticipated fully",1266.765,3.036
being engulfed in healthcare right now.,1269.801,2.203
And I think that we&amp;#39;re accelerating that.,1272.004,1.701
The President has got his team working overtime.,1273.705,2.603
He&amp;#39;s been giving them feedback as far as what he,1276.308,2.436
wants to see and how he wants to see it.,1278.744,1.768
But this is a big task.,1280.512,1.101
It&amp;#39;s taken 30 years and we&amp;#39;re going to get to it.,1281.613,1.535
The Press: Is the White House going to write its,1283.148,1.335
"own proposal here, or is this going to be like the",1284.483,2.669
healthcare debate where we thought we were going to,1287.152,2.236
"see a proposal from the White House, but in the",1289.388,2.502
end the President sort of signed on to,1291.89,2.002
Paul Ryan&amp;#39;s plan?,1293.892,0.734
"Mr. Spicer: First, I would dispute that we signed on",1294.626,2.503
to someone&amp;#39;s plan.,1297.129,0.734
"We worked with the House -- as you know, from the",1297.863,1.902
"President&amp;#39;s statements, we were very on board.",1299.765,1.534
I would suggest to you to say that we signed on to a,1301.299,2.937
plan -- it was a work that,1304.236,1.601
both sides worked together on.,1305.837,1.335
We worked with the Senate as well.,1307.172,1.335
And I think this plan -- I would assume that,1308.507,2.569
hopefully we come up with a plan that we all agree on.,1311.076,3.437
"The President will put out principles, I&amp;#39;m sure, as",1314.513,2.169
"we&amp;#39;ve already done, in terms of what his goals",1316.682,1.468
are and how he wants to drive this as the process,1318.15,1.701
moves forward.,1319.851,1.669
But I&amp;#39;m sure that we&amp;#39;re going to have a robust,1321.52,1.568
"debate about aspects of that plan, certain",1323.088,2.469
provisions and certain other tax pieces.,1325.557,2.369
But we&amp;#39;re going to work with the House and the,1327.926,1.735
Senate on it.,1329.661,0.667
"The Press: And on trade, the President, during the",1330.328,2.97
campaign -- he&amp;#39;s now gearing up for this,1333.298,2.636
meeting with the Chinese President at Mar-a-Lago.,1335.934,2.302
"During the campaign, he suggested that on day one,",1338.236,2.937
he would declare China a currency manipulator.,1341.173,2.335
He hasn&amp;#39;t done that.,1343.508,1.302
Why hasn&amp;#39;t the President followed through on that,1344.81,2.636
campaign promise?,1347.446,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I think we need to have that meeting,1348.113,3.07
with President Xi.,1351.183,0.767
I&amp;#39;m sure that there will be a lot of discussions,1351.95,2.202
about our economic relationship.,1354.152,3.137
"And so I don&amp;#39;t -- we are days away from that, and",1357.289,3.97
let&amp;#39;s see what those -- I just don&amp;#39;t want to,1361.259,2.303
"prejudge -- we&amp;#39;re days away from it, and I know",1363.562,2.235
there&amp;#39;s a lot of issues that need to come up and I,1365.797,2.469
don&amp;#39;t want to get in front of it.,1368.266,1.969
Olivier.,1370.235,0.667
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1370.902,0.668
"Two, if I may.",1371.57,0.7
"One on China, one on the Middle East.",1372.27,1.402
Does the administration plan to order a review,1373.672,3.003
into China&amp;#39;s status as a nonmarket economy?,1376.675,2.636
Mr. Spicer: At this time the two trade executive,1379.311,3.87
orders that focus on countervailing duties and,1383.181,4.438
-- are where we&amp;#39;re going to look.,1387.619,1.735
I think we&amp;#39;ve got a lot -- obviously that&amp;#39;s an issue,1389.354,4.405
that we would probably hope to have the U.S.,1393.759,1.801
trade representative confirmed.,1395.56,1.135
But that&amp;#39;s a combined decision I think that in,1396.695,3.37
consultation with the Department of Commerce and,1400.065,2.102
the Department of Treasury.,1402.167,1.635
But let&amp;#39;s see how we go first.,1403.802,1.969
The Press: And then can you clear up where the,1405.771,2.002
President stands on whether Bashar Assad is,1407.773,2.469
the legitimate President of Syria?,1410.242,2.002
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think with respect to Assad,",1412.244,3.803
there is a political reality that we have to,1416.047,5.172
accept in terms of where we are right now.,1421.219,2.736
We lost a lot of opportunity the last,1423.955,2.102
administration with respect to Assad.,1426.057,2.236
And I think that our statement that both U.N.,1428.293,3.47
Ambassador Haley gave yesterday and Secretary of,1431.763,3.57
State Tillerson reflects the reality that it&amp;#39;s now,1435.333,3.003
up to the Syrian people.,1438.336,2.436
We had an opportunity and we need to focus,1440.772,2.736
on now defeating ISIS.,1443.508,1.802
But the United States has profound priorities in,1445.31,3.303
"Syria and Iraq, and we made it clear that",1448.613,2.269
"counterterrorism, particularly the defeat of",1450.882,1.602
"ISIS, is foremost among those priorities.",1452.484,2.636
And that&amp;#39;s why our forces in the global coalition,1455.12,2.436
are partnering with local forces against ISIS,1457.556,2.002
in Iraq and Syria.,1459.558,1.034
But I mean -- I think there is a bit of,1460.592,2.202
political reality with respect to where we are,1462.794,2.636
now versus where we were the last administration in,1465.43,2.836
terms of there being a potential -- there is not,1468.266,3.237
the opposition that existed last time and the,1471.503,1.702
opportunities that existed last time.,1473.205,2.135
The Press: It sounds like you&amp;#39;re saying whether or,1475.34,2.669
not he&amp;#39;s legitimate -- if you were to declare him,1478.009,3.103
illegitimate there&amp;#39;s nothing the United States,1481.112,1.335
"could do about that, so there&amp;#39;s no point in --",1482.447,1.335
Mr. Spicer: I think there is a bit of reality that,1483.782,2.803
has to be addressed with respect to the opportunity,1486.585,3.536
and the options that we have now that we don&amp;#39;t,1490.121,3.904
have or didn&amp;#39;t have -- they had in the,1494.025,2.203
last administration.,1496.228,0.867
And there is a reality that just doesn&amp;#39;t,1497.095,2.536
exist in the same way.,1499.631,1.001
Jon-Christopher.,1500.632,0.667
The Press: Thank you.,1501.299,1.468
What&amp;#39;s really the end game for Mr. Assad when the,1502.767,4.271
"President speaks to his allies, his NATO partners?",1507.038,3.437
Obviously Assad is not going to retire somewhere,1510.475,3.437
in the south of France.,1513.912,1.034
Something has got to give.,1514.946,1.568
What is the thought there?,1516.514,1.569
"What is the disposition, the conversation in terms",1518.083,2.502
"of Assad, who is very close to Mr. Putin and",1520.585,3.137
would like to have a warm water port,1523.722,2.702
in the Mediterranean?,1526.424,0.835
Mr. Spicer: I think we believe there&amp;#39;s a need to,1527.259,3.503
deescalate violence and to have a political process,1530.762,2.803
through which Syrians will decide their own political,1533.565,2.636
future consistent with the principles that have been,1536.201,1.735
enshrined in U.N.,1537.936,1.201
Security Council Resolution 2254.,1539.137,4.838
But there&amp;#39;s a bit of -- as I mentioned just a second,1543.975,1.835
"ago, there&amp;#39;s a bit of reality on the ground in",1545.81,2.303
terms of what the options are.,1548.113,1.368
The Press: During the presidential campaign the,1549.481,4.07
President said he was with the state on North,1553.551,2.57
Carolina&amp;#39;s law banning transgender people from,1556.121,1.902
using certain restrooms.,1558.023,1.134
The Democratic governor yesterday signed a deal to,1559.157,3.37
replace that law with a measure that civil rights,1562.527,2.436
groups still say is discriminatory.,1564.963,1.368
Does the President support this law?,1566.331,1.635
Mr. Spicer: I have not asked the President.,1567.966,1.735
I would say consistent with what he said during,1569.701,2.102
the campaign cycle he believes in states&amp;#39;,1571.803,2.236
"rights, so -- The Press: -- different issue, but",1574.039,3.87
what is the President&amp;#39;s personal view on bathrooms,1577.909,1.802
for transgender people and the way states,1579.711,1.535
should approach it?,1581.246,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I think that the President has made it,1581.913,2.636
clear -- this issue came up when Caitlyn Jenner in,1584.549,1.869
particular came to Trump Tower and he said he,1586.418,2.269
didn&amp;#39;t really care.,1588.687,0.867
"But I think it is a state and local issue, not one",1589.554,3.27
that he believes needs federal attention.,1592.824,1.535
Matt.,1594.359,0.667
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1595.026,0.668
"Given that it&amp;#39;s financial disclosure day, why will",1595.694,4.337
the White House not be releasing --,1600.031,1.669
Mr. Spicer: -- proclamation on that.,1601.7,1.334
(Laughter.),1603.034,0.668
The Press: Why won&amp;#39;t the White House not be,1603.702,1.368
releasing the President&amp;#39;s 2016 tax,1605.07,2.736
"returns, given, conceivably, those can&amp;#39;t",1607.806,2.636
be under audit yet while the audit has obviously,1610.442,3.77
been the reason for why you haven&amp;#39;t released,1614.212,1.902
those past returns?,1616.114,0.734
"Mr. Spicer: I mean, look, asked and -- I mean, the",1616.848,2.503
President has been very clear about his tax,1619.351,1.468
returns and his position on that.,1620.819,1.568
The Office of Government Ethics requires every,1622.387,3.437
federal employee at a certain level to file,1625.824,2.636
"these financial disclosure forms, that anyone in",1628.46,2.335
"America can go on to -- it will be the first time, I",1630.795,2.203
believe -- and I don&amp;#39;t want to get ahead of the,1632.998,1.434
background briefing to give away the good stuff,1634.432,2.036
-- but I believe that this is the first time that,1636.468,1.535
they&amp;#39;re on the White House website.,1638.003,1.334
"We are making them more accessible, more available",1639.337,2.403
than in history.,1641.74,0.667
The Press: So then why not make this step --,1642.407,1.668
Mr. Spicer: I think that&amp;#39;s apples and oranges.,1644.075,1.502
These are required by law.,1645.577,3.236
These lists -- just for everyone who&amp;#39;s not,1648.813,2.303
"familiar with them, the financial disclosure forms",1651.116,2.936
that we file -- I think it&amp;#39;s called a 278 --,1654.052,3.236
"reveal every asset you own, every debt that you",1657.288,1.769
"have, your spouse&amp;#39;s income, your spouse&amp;#39;s",1659.057,2.502
"employment, holdings that you have, credit card",1661.559,2.403
"debt, other -- I mean, it is a fairly comprehensive",1663.962,4.171
"undertaking of every asset that a person owns, every",1668.133,3.47
debt that they have.,1671.603,1.535
And I think that that is a very clear understanding,1673.138,3.27
"of the assets that people have, the value of those",1676.408,3.136
"assets, both in terms of whether they&amp;#39;re worth",1679.544,2.269
something or the liabilities that,1681.813,1.335
they&amp;#39;re incurring.,1683.148,0.834
"That is a very, very transparent way of being",1683.982,3.27
able to understand someone&amp;#39;s -- and so to,1687.252,2.969
equate the two is rather --,1690.221,1.635
"The Press: Sure, I just was using that as a jumping-off",1691.856,2.937
point for the tax returns question.,1694.793,1.401
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I&amp;#39;ll jump back.",1696.194,1.335
The Press: If the audit is not the reason for the returns --,1697.529,2.669
Mr. Spicer: I didn&amp;#39;t say --,1700.198,0.667
The Press: -- because there can&amp;#39;t be an audit of --,1700.865,2.87
"Mr. Spicer: Right, but you&amp;#39;ll also remember that taxes aren&amp;#39;t",1703.735,2.536
due until the 15th of April.,1706.271,0.667
The Press: So can we expect them on the 15th of,1706.938,1.335
April?,1708.273,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know.,1708.94,0.667
I&amp;#39;m not -- I don&amp;#39;t know.,1709.607,0.668
I haven&amp;#39;t really gotten into -- I&amp;#39;m worried about,1710.275,1.635
getting my own done.,1711.91,0.967
But I&amp;#39;ll -- The Press: Are you going to release them?,1712.877,3.604
Mr. Spicer: No.,1716.481,0.968
(Laughter.),1717.449,0.667
"But I think that -- again, I think",1718.116,2.269
"that, respectfully, you look at what we&amp;#39;re doing,",1720.385,2.436
"frankly -- and again, this will be discussed after",1722.821,2.502
this is done -- but I think there is an element,1725.323,2.77
of going above and beyond what has been done in the,1728.093,2.969
past to make sure that people have access to this.,1731.062,2.002
There is a lot of people -- I think one of the,1733.064,1.335
really interesting things that people are going to,1734.399,1.768
see today -- and I think it&amp;#39;s something that should,1736.167,2.002
be celebrated -- is that the President has brought,1738.169,1.902
"a lot of people into this administration, and this",1740.071,1.835
"White House in particular, who have been very blessed",1741.906,2.803
"and very successful by this country, and have",1744.709,2.669
given up a lot to come into government by setting,1747.378,4.371
aside a lot of assets.,1751.749,2.203
And I think it speaks volumes to the desire for,1753.952,2.636
a lot of these people to fulfill the President&amp;#39;s,1756.588,2.269
vision and move the agenda forward that they are,1758.857,3.436
"willing to list all of their assets, undergo this",1762.293,2.937
"public scrutiny, but also set aside a lot.",1765.23,2.836
Because you&amp;#39;ll see that people are often told they,1768.066,2.569
have to sell an asset or get rid of something to,1770.635,1.869
come serve in the government.,1772.504,1.534
And there&amp;#39;s a lot of people that have done a,1774.038,2.303
lot to come into this administration to give,1776.341,2.502
"back, that have been inspired by the",1778.843,2.002
President&amp;#39;s victory and the President&amp;#39;s agenda to,1780.845,2.67
move the country forward.,1783.515,0.9
Jim.,1784.415,0.668
The Press: General Flynn&amp;#39;s attorney said that his,1785.083,3.303
client has a &amp;quot;story to tell.&amp;quot;,1788.386,2.736
Is the White House concerned that General,1791.122,2.069
Flynn has damaging information about the,1793.191,2.869
"President, his aides, his associates about what",1796.06,2.203
occurred during the campaign with,1798.263,1.368
respect to Russia?,1799.631,0.8
Mr. Spicer: Nope.,1800.431,0.768
The Press: Okay.,1801.199,0.834
"The other thing I wanted to ask you, to follow up",1802.033,1.502
"on that, is, you were just saying a few moments ago",1803.535,3.036
that some of this information that would be,1806.571,2.803
helpful to the committee -- you were talking about,1809.374,2.602
Evelyn Farkas and so forth -- that seems to be,1811.976,3.437
something that pertains to during the transition.,1815.413,2.436
But the President&amp;#39;s tweets time and again talked,1817.849,2.869
about &amp;quot;tapping my phones&amp;quot; in October just,1820.718,2.303
prior to the election.,1823.021,0.834
&amp;quot;Just found out Obama had my wires tapped in Trump,1823.855,3.77
Tower just before the victory.&amp;quot;,1827.625,1.368
I&amp;#39;m just kind of -- I want to get something clear,1828.993,2.002
about the time frame.,1830.995,0.901
Does the White House have any information -- is it,1831.896,2.336
providing any information to these Intelligence,1834.232,2.002
Committees that would draw these members to the,1836.234,3.603
conclusion that there was some kind of surveillance,1839.837,2.136
going on before the election as the President,1841.973,2.569
originally alleged?,1844.542,0.801
"Mr. Spicer: So again, I don&amp;#39;t want to specifically",1845.343,2.703
get in -- but I think if we&amp;#39;re splitting hairs,1848.046,1.468
"about what day of the calendar it was, that&amp;#39;s a",1849.514,2.602
pretty interesting development.,1852.116,2.169
I think that we have now come to a place,1854.285,2.002
where I think that we can --,1856.287,0.668
The Press: The President&amp;#39;s allegations --,1856.955,1.868
Mr. Spicer: I understand that.,1858.823,0.667
"But if the allegation is, well, it was actually on",1859.49,1.402
the 1st of December or the 10th of December versus,1860.892,2.002
"the 31st of October, I think that we&amp;#39;re starting",1862.894,2.602
to split some serious hairs here.,1865.496,1.936
"The idea that -- and again, I just -- it&amp;#39;s",1867.432,3.069
"interesting that now we&amp;#39;re arguing over the date,",1870.501,2.703
not the substance.,1873.204,1.001
And the substance is why were people using,1874.205,4.138
"government resources, violating civil liberties,",1878.343,2.769
potentially -- looking into people&amp;#39;s backgrounds,1881.112,2.669
"to surveil them, to understand what they were",1883.781,2.703
"doing, and who they were, to unmask them, provide",1886.484,2.703
their names to sources; spread classified,1889.187,4.404
"information, make it available to others,",1893.591,3.437
spread it to places that they weren&amp;#39;t,1897.028,1.368
supposed to use it --,1898.396,2.302
The Press: Then --,1900.698,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: But, hold on, let me just --",1901.366,1.668
"I think that it is interesting. Because again,",1903.034,1.602
I get your question. But if what we&amp;#39;re really arguing is did,1904.636,3.603
"it happen on a Monday or a Tuesday, or did it happen on",1908.239,2.469
"the 31st versus the 7th or the 8th, I think we&amp;#39;ve",1910.708,2.903
lost focus here.,1913.611,0.834
There is --,1914.445,0.668
The Press: But you started off as allegations --,1915.113,1.334
Mr. Spicer: Hold on. I&amp;#39;ll answer.,1916.447,1.335
Just let me finish --,1917.782,0.701
The Press: -- surveillance and --,1918.483,1.334
Mr. Spicer: I understand that.,1919.817,0.668
The Press: -- not that the dates are changing.,1920.485,1.334
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, they&amp;#39;re not.",1921.819,1.335
I didn&amp;#39;t say they were changing.,1923.154,1.335
Just to be clear.,1924.489,0.667
I&amp;#39;m just saying that it is -- it is fascinating to me,1925.156,1.735
"that we are now arguing over the date,",1926.891,1.969
not the substance.,1928.86,1.535
I understand your point.,1930.395,0.7
"And if we get down to that, we come out and you",1931.095,2.069
really want to get into what date -- because I,1933.164,2.669
think it is really getting lost in the debate that,1935.833,3.17
American citizens who were not government employees,1939.003,3.671
"at the time, who were not targets of stuff",1942.674,2.369
"potentially were surveilled, had their",1945.043,3.103
"information unmasked, made it available, was",1948.146,2.836
politically spread.,1950.982,1.301
And all of this should be very concerning to people,1952.283,4.772
that an administration or people in an,1957.055,1.701
"administration, people serving in government who",1958.756,2.636
"are provided classified information, who are given",1961.392,2.603
clearance in the trust of the United States,1963.995,1.768
"government misused, mishandled, and",1965.763,2.436
"potentially did some very, very bad things with",1968.199,3.17
classified information.,1971.369,1.168
That astonishes me that that is not the subject of,1972.537,4.371
"this; that all of this is happening in our country,",1976.908,3.603
"and yet the subject -- and again, we talk about what",1980.511,2.503
"door someone came in, what date it happened -- there",1983.014,2.869
"is a concern that people misused, mishandled,",1985.883,3.704
"misdirected classified information, leaked it",1989.587,3.303
"out, spread it out, violated civil liberties.",1992.89,3.304
And the potential that that happened should,1996.194,3.069
concern every single American.,1999.263,2.436
"The Press: And to follow up on that, I think we are",2001.699,3.27
concerned about the substance just as,2004.969,1.568
much as the process.,2006.537,1.802
But the details matter.,2008.339,1.835
But I just want to make sure -- you clearly --,2010.174,2.57
because it seems like you&amp;#39;re going farther than,2012.744,1.768
what we&amp;#39;ve heard in previous briefings.,2014.512,1.568
"It sounds like you are, just as the President is,",2016.08,3.404
alleging that the Obama administration conducted,2019.484,2.903
unlawful surveillance on the Trump campaign and,2022.387,2.168
Trump transition team.,2024.555,0.835
Mr. Spicer: What I am saying very,2025.39,1.668
clearly is that as --,2027.058,1.034
The Press: Do you have evidence of that?,2028.092,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, no, I don&amp;#39;t.",2029.427,1.335
I know that what has been provided to -- as I said,2030.762,2.302
"in the statement, I believe that what has been",2033.064,3.303
provided and will be provided to members of,2036.367,3.37
both committees I think should further,2039.737,2.069
their investigation.,2041.806,0.934
I think that the revelations of Evelyn,2042.74,2.236
"Farkas, who played a senior role in the Obama",2044.976,2.569
"administration, going on the record to talk about",2047.545,2.369
how they politically used classified,2049.914,2.903
information is troubling.,2052.817,1.201
I believe that the reports that are coming out day by,2054.018,3.604
"day that NBC has just reported, that John just",2057.622,2.269
"detailed what Fox has reported -- day by day,",2059.891,2.769
"more and more, we are seeing that the substance",2062.66,2.436
of what we&amp;#39;ve been talking about continues to move,2065.096,2.469
exactly in the direction that the President spoke,2067.565,2.402
about in terms of surveillance,2069.967,1.368
that occurred.,2071.335,0.668
And that should be very troubling.,2072.003,2.102
"That, frankly, should be something that everyone",2074.105,3.103
"looks at and says, what&amp;#39;s going on here?",2077.208,2.603
Why did it happen?,2079.811,0.934
Who did it?,2080.745,1.001
And how are we going to get to the bottom of it?,2081.746,1.568
That&amp;#39;s what concerns me.,2083.314,1.201
Steve Holland.,2084.515,0.668
The Press: Can I go back to China for a second?,2085.183,2.636
The President yesterday said that the meeting next,2087.819,2.669
"week with China will be a difficult one, and he",2090.488,2.97
referred to massive trade deficits.,2093.458,1.368
Now what sort of tone is he hoping to,2094.826,2.168
set for this meeting?,2096.994,1.001
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think he&amp;#39;s been very clear --",2097.995,2.837
The Press: Why is it going to be so difficult?,2100.832,2.902
Mr. Spicer: Why is what?,2103.734,0.701
"The Press: Why is it going to be so difficult,",2104.435,1.335
as he says?,2105.77,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Why -- there&amp;#39;s big issues.,2106.437,1.335
I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a surprise to anybody in,2107.772,1.334
terms of -- we&amp;#39;ve got both national security issues,2109.106,1.335
in terms of our political posture towards North,2110.441,3.604
"Korea, the threat of a missile that extends",2114.045,2.302
"further and further, the tests that they&amp;#39;re using,",2116.347,5.339
their nuclear capability.,2121.686,1.067
Those should all be very concerning.,2122.753,1.335
"And then on the trade front, we&amp;#39;ve got serious",2124.088,1.769
"concerns with what they&amp;#39;re doing, our trade practices",2125.857,3.47
"with them, some of the things that were",2129.327,1.868
mentioned in the past.,2131.195,0.968
But there&amp;#39;s a lot of areas that we need to be,2132.163,2.369
concerned about with trade.,2134.532,1.101
And I think that -- this isn&amp;#39;t a sit around and,2135.633,6.24
play patty-cake kind of conversation.,2141.873,1.434
They&amp;#39;re big issues.,2143.307,0.701
The President has been making it very clear since,2144.008,2.402
"-- for decades, frankly, of the challenges",2146.41,1.802
that we face.,2148.212,0.934
And I think he wants to have a very good and,2149.146,1.936
respectful and healthy relationship.,2151.082,1.935
But he also wants to make sure that he tackles the,2153.017,1.635
challenges and the problems that are facing,2154.652,1.935
American workers and American manufacturers,2156.587,1.802
and get to them.,2158.389,1.068
"I&amp;#39;m going to go to my first seat, and then Glenn",2159.457,1.468
because he&amp;#39;s patient.,2160.925,0.734
"First Skype seat, Maurice Goodman, from",2161.659,4.204
WWDB-AM in Philly.,2165.863,2.169
So shout out to Hallie&amp;#39;s old stations.,2168.032,1.935
The Press: In Philadelphia.,2169.967,2.369
It&amp;#39;s Randall Jefferson.,2172.336,2.269
The question is: President Trump signed an executive,2176.741,4.371
order that he intends to not fund cities that,2181.112,3.17
refuse to share immigration,2184.282,2.035
status information.,2186.317,2.269
Attorney General Sessions recently suggested that,2188.586,4.471
cities could not only lose future funds but that the,2193.057,3.837
federal government may require them to,2196.894,2.569
pay back grants.,2199.463,1.535
Will there be a -- when and will -- when will this,2200.998,5.005
take place?,2208.339,1.268
And will that money be reallocated to other,2209.607,5.105
departments like the Department of,2214.712,2.102
Education or HBCUs?,2216.814,1.568
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I&amp;#39;m not -- I would say that the",2218.382,5.806
President finds it unacceptable that some,2224.188,3.57
localities and counties and potentially some,2227.758,2.803
states have prioritized a political agenda over the,2230.561,2.669
safety of their people by flouting our nation&amp;#39;s,2233.23,2.603
"immigration laws, becoming so-called",2235.833,2.102
sanctuary cities.,2237.935,1.535
The failure to follow federal law can have,2239.47,1.835
tragic consequences for all of our citizens and,2241.305,3.837
all of our country.,2245.142,1.435
It&amp;#39;s particularly concerning in a place like,2246.577,1.568
Chicago and other cities like yours in Philadelphia,2248.145,2.303
where there&amp;#39;s been increased violence.,2250.448,2.502
Immigrants both legal and illegal are not safe from,2252.95,3.037
criminals who have committed egregious acts,2255.987,2.168
are free to roam the streets.,2258.155,1.001
And the Attorney General has issued a public notice,2259.156,2.503
reminding all states and local jurisdictions of,2261.659,2.469
their responsibilities to comply with federal laws.,2264.128,3.103
"With respect to the budget piece, I think we&amp;#39;ve had",2267.231,3.404
"an ongoing budget process, and we&amp;#39;ll have to see how",2270.635,4.037
"many states comply and where, if any, potential",2274.672,2.903
savings are there and then how we allocate them.,2277.575,2.135
But I think the President&amp;#39;s budget -- both,2279.71,1.735
his FY17 contingency budget for funding beyond,2281.445,5.906
"this continuing resolution on April 28th, and then",2287.351,2.503
his FY18 budget that he&amp;#39;s already submitted -- are,2289.854,3.436
going to reflect some key priorities both in terms,2293.29,2.136
of homeland security and national defense.,2295.426,2.269
So we&amp;#39;ll see where we would reallocate any of,2297.695,3.17
"that money, but I think the priority is clear is",2300.865,1.735
to get cities into compliance and to make,2302.6,3.637
sure that we understand there&amp;#39;s not just a,2306.237,2.536
financial impact to this but also a very clear,2308.773,2.936
security aspect of this.,2311.709,1.568
Glenn.,2313.277,0.734
"The Press: Two things, Sean.",2314.011,2.236
"First, just to follow up on something",2316.247,1.334
you said before.,2317.581,0.668
You said that Hillary Clinton had personal,2318.249,1.635
"contact with Vladimir Putin, and the suggestion",2319.884,1.968
was that wasn&amp;#39;t necessarily appropriate.,2321.852,1.402
Can you just elaborate what you were --,2323.254,2.235
"Mr. Spicer: Oh, no, I&amp;#39;m not saying that&amp;#39;s -- the",2325.489,2.836
contact in itself is not appropriate -- is not --,2328.325,2.236
"The Press: I mean, as a private citizen or as a --",2330.561,2.269
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, no.",2332.83,0.701
I think what I&amp;#39;m saying is that when you talk about,2333.531,2.035
"connections to Russia, I think the only connection",2335.566,2.402
that anyone has made with President Trump is,2337.968,2.67
multiple years ago he hosted a pageant there and,2340.638,2.235
he&amp;#39;s -- some of the -- he owns condos around the,2342.873,3.237
world and some of them were sold to some,2346.11,2.035
"Russians, and I think he sold a house to one",2348.145,2.57
several years back.,2350.715,1.301
That&amp;#39;s his connection.,2352.016,1.334
"When you talk about the other side, you look at",2353.35,2.002
what the Obama administration&amp;#39;s,2355.352,1.268
connections were.,2356.62,0.668
You have a Secretary of State that was selling a,2357.288,2.035
fifth of our country&amp;#39;s uranium.,2359.323,1.635
You have a Clinton Foundation concern with,2360.958,1.735
some of the donations they got.,2362.693,2.403
"You&amp;#39;ve got the former President, her husband,",2365.096,2.102
"giving paid speeches, getting a personal call",2367.198,1.801
from Vladimir Putin.,2368.999,1.168
"You&amp;#39;ve got a stated goal of that administration, of",2370.167,4.438
Secretary Clinton to have a reset to,2374.605,2.002
&amp;quot;strengthen Russia.&amp;quot;,2376.607,2.069
So when you compare the two sides in terms of,2378.676,2.869
"who&amp;#39;s actually engaging with Russia, trying to",2381.545,2.57
"strengthen them, trying to act with them, trying to",2384.115,1.835
"interact with them, it is night and day between our",2385.95,3.069
actions and her actions and yet no one questioned,2389.019,3.037
"what she was doing or how she was handling it, and",2392.056,1.902
yet -- The Press: So you think that her pattern of,2393.958,1.501
behavior is more suspicious than President,2395.459,1.735
Trump&amp;#39;s pattern of behavior?,2397.194,1.802
Mr. Spicer: I think that if you compare the two,2398.996,1.368
it&amp;#39;s definitely -- when you talk about the stuff,2400.364,1.335
"that went to their foundation, the concerns",2401.699,2.702
that existed around the sale of one-fifth of all,2404.401,1.969
"the country&amp;#39;s uranium, the paid speeches, the",2406.37,2.269
personal calls from Vladimir Putin -- I think,2408.639,2.636
that when you want to look at a connection to Russia,2411.275,2.002
"there is a clear one there, and much less of",2413.277,2.603
one that ever existed on this side.,2415.88,1.768
"The Press: So, Sean, in terms of the Nunes",2417.648,3.77
"chronology, just to clarify, when we&amp;#39;re asking",2421.418,2.937
"questions about process like gates and people,",2424.355,2.903
we&amp;#39;re not attempting to ascertain the geography of,2427.258,3.37
"the executive complex, we want to know",2430.628,2.736
who knew what and when.,2433.364,1.134
Mr. Spicer: I understand that.,2434.498,1.702
The Press: So my question is -- so I will ask that,2436.2,1.335
"directly, forget about the technical questions.",2437.535,2.469
Mr. Nunes was on the campus.,2440.004,1.468
"You say we don&amp;#39;t know who let him in the gate, so",2441.472,2.469
"apparently it is -- and you described that, I",2443.941,2.603
"believe, this is a normal process, right?",2446.544,2.035
Tell me if it is normal the way that,2448.579,1.468
I&amp;#39;m describing it.,2450.047,0.801
"Mr. Nunes, the head of an investigatory committee,",2450.848,2.169
is allowed to roam around the executive complex --,2453.017,2.402
we don&amp;#39;t know who let him in -- to speak to two,2455.419,3.837
deputy-level members of the National Security Council.,2459.256,3.37
He is then allowed to see information.,2462.626,1.569
"He then obtains an appointment, from my",2464.195,2.736
"understanding of the chronology, with the",2466.931,2.335
President of the United States to disgorge,2469.266,2.736
that information.,2472.002,0.868
He then goes public with that information.,2472.87,2.602
"Then seven or so days later, you say it would be",2475.472,2.837
appropriate for everybody to come down here,2478.309,1.801
and look at it.,2480.11,0.868
Is that a normal process?,2480.978,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: Well, A, I would take issue with a",2482.313,2.602
number of the aspects of your chronology.,2484.915,1.969
"Number one, which you&amp;#39;re forgetting, is that",2486.884,2.569
initially he is the one that publicly said well,2489.453,2.302
before any of this came to light in terms of the,2491.755,2.703
President&amp;#39;s March 5th tweet that he was just,2494.458,4.371
looking into this whole matter.,2498.829,1.535
"He, according to John Roberts, his own",2500.364,2.469
"reporting, just said that neither of those",2502.833,1.935
individuals as described in your paper&amp;#39;s reporting,2504.768,2.002
are accurate.,2506.77,0.668
So I would dispute several of the pieces that -- and,2507.438,3.437
then as far as him roaming around the White House --,2510.875,2.202
"The Press: Well, you won&amp;#39;t tell us who let him in,",2513.077,1.334
so we don&amp;#39;t know.,2514.411,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: No, I understand this, but you",2515.079,1.334
"-- again, you jump to a ton of conclusions about",2516.413,1.902
"-- and again, I love watching some of these",2518.315,2.069
shows where they jump to conclusions --,2520.384,1.468
The Press: -- several times prejudged the investigation as,2521.852,2.97
clearing the White House.,2524.822,1.268
You said it twice at the podium today.,2526.09,1.334
Mr. Spicer: Right.,2527.424,0.668
The Press: So we&amp;#39;re not prejudging --,2528.092,1.334
Mr. Spicer: What I&amp;#39;m saying is -- because I&amp;#39;m focused on,2529.426,1.335
"the substance of this, Glenn.",2530.761,0.667
"The Press: Well, what -- Mr. Spicer: Right, and so",2531.428,1.368
where is any of the reporting been in your,2532.796,1.902
paper about Evelyn Farkas and her revelation that,2534.698,3.037
this is what they sought to do?,2537.735,1.434
Where has been the reporting in your paper,2539.169,1.969
that NBC News just recently covered that,2541.138,1.535
other officials -- you seem to be really focused,2542.673,2.736
on who showed up where and what door they went in,2545.409,2.102
and how it happened.,2547.511,1.001
"To answer your question, yes, it&amp;#39;s appropriate for",2548.512,2.369
a member of Congress to contact someone who has,2550.881,2.169
"contacted him, according to some of these reports.",2553.05,2.736
"I don&amp;#39;t know the answer to that, but if you&amp;#39;re asking",2555.786,1.802
me is it appropriate for a member of Congress to come,2557.588,1.668
"over here -- as Chairman Nunes has said himself, he",2559.256,2.403
"wasn&amp;#39;t hiding or roaming, he was asked to come over",2561.659,3.103
here by an individual.,2564.762,0.901
"He came over, which happens daily.",2565.663,2.535
"He was asked to go somewhere, he went there.",2568.198,2.336
He is cleared.,2570.534,1.602
And nothing that is inappropriate other --,2572.136,2.803
exactly the opposite.,2574.939,2.702
"What he did, what he saw, and who he met with was",2577.641,2.436
100 percent proper.,2580.077,1.501
"The Press: Did the Chief of Staff, who is, at my",2581.578,3.204
"understanding, an exceptionally attentive",2584.782,2.202
gatekeeper to who comes in and out of the Oval,2586.984,2.502
"Office, did the Chief of Staff know that he",2589.486,2.97
was on the campus?,2592.456,0.701
Did he approve his --,2593.157,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: But remember, you&amp;#39;re -- okay, but you&amp;#39;re playing",2593.824,2.035
cute there. You&amp;#39;re doing two things.,2595.859,1.635
One is you&amp;#39;re talking about the Oval Office and,2597.494,2.102
the other one is the campus.,2599.596,1.702
"So, no, the Chief of Staff does not know every single",2601.298,2.603
person who&amp;#39;s on the 18 acres at any given time.,2603.901,2.502
They are people who are appropriately either,2606.403,3.07
cleared or WAVEd through the system or are escorted,2609.473,3.103
"on in some way, shape or form.",2612.576,1.535
"No, we don&amp;#39;t track every single person who&amp;#39;s",2614.111,2.102
on the 18 acres.,2616.213,1.168
"Do we know, generally speaking, who&amp;#39;s in the",2617.381,1.668
Oval Office?,2619.049,0.935
"Not all the time, because people can go in.",2619.984,1.901
"But if there was a meeting -- in that case, we all",2621.885,1.869
"sat back here, he made the announcement -- and again,",2623.754,2.669
you&amp;#39;re leaving out a key part.,2626.423,1.302
He actually briefed the press before he,2627.725,2.235
told anyone.,2629.96,1.168
"We all found -- you, me, everyone else -- that he",2631.128,2.97
was coming down here after he held a press conference,2634.098,2.135
with your colleagues to say he was coming down,2636.233,2.269
here based on stuff that he had found that didn&amp;#39;t,2638.502,2.002
have to do with Russia that a whistle-blower,2640.504,2.002
source had given him.,2642.506,1.201
"Now, the other reporting that I&amp;#39;m hearing today is",2643.707,1.769
actually that the sources that you describe in your,2645.476,1.935
paper are not accurate.,2647.411,1.668
"And while I&amp;#39;m not going to comment on either, I think",2649.079,1.869
there is an assumption that everything -- and the,2650.948,1.868
chronology that we know is accurate -- which I don&amp;#39;t,2652.816,2.603
"believe, from further reporting, that it is.",2655.419,1.702
And I also believe that some of the comments that,2657.121,2.769
have come out publicly in terms of some of the Obama,2659.89,1.902
administration are conveniently left out,2661.792,1.969
of that discussion.,2663.761,1.034
I think that that is interesting how no one,2664.795,1.868
seems to really cover the fact that in a -- senior,2666.663,2.603
Obama administration with high-level clearances,2669.266,2.703
talked about the spreading of classified information,2671.969,3.103
for political purposes and no one seems to care.,2675.072,3.003
"The Press: But just to be clear, Mr. Pribus,",2678.075,2.469
"Mr. Kushner, Mr. Bannon did not have knowledge of",2680.544,4.071
"his being on the campus, having this interaction with --",2684.615,2.169
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know.,2686.784,1.601
"Again, you asked two questions and you",2688.385,1.935
melded them together.,2690.32,1.102
No one knew that he was coming to,2691.422,1.334
speak to the President.,2692.756,1.001
He announced that on television during,2693.757,1.802
a press conference.,2695.559,0.834
The Press: My understanding is that,2696.393,3.437
Dr. Farkas left the administration in 2015.,2699.83,3.203
So why is what she said in 2017 relevant to something,2703.033,5.139
that allegedly happened in 2016?,2708.172,1.835
Mr. Spicer: The question I would have for you is --,2710.007,2.069
"exactly, why is it -- what does - she says inner",2712.076,2.369
"things -- I&amp;#39;m urging my colleagues, I&amp;#39;m urging it",2714.445,1.868
to get -- the Hill.,2716.313,0.834
But it&amp;#39;s odd that the presumption seems to be,2717.147,1.902
why is it interesting.,2719.049,0.934
Have you asked her?,2719.983,0.701
"The Press: No, you&amp;#39;re the one telling us to -- from",2720.684,1.368
you right now.,2722.052,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: No, you haven&amp;#39;t.",2722.719,0.835
"So she -- no, no, but she&amp;#39;s been on television",2723.554,2.469
"talking about what she&amp;#39;s done, and you seem to have",2726.023,3.003
made no --,2729.026,0.667
The Press: I don&amp;#39;t believe everything I see on TV.,2729.693,1.935
(Laughter.),2731.628,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: Well, neither do I, but I also --",2732.296,2.035
I would assume that as a reporter that,2734.331,2.069
"actually is interested in the story, a senior Obama",2736.4,2.703
administration official that handled Russia --,2739.103,2.335
The Press: Former.,2741.438,0.668
"The Press: Former, in 2015.",2742.106,0.9
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, well, all Obama administration",2743.006,2.303
officials generally are --,2745.309,0.901
"The Press: No, but she wasn&amp;#39;t there in 2016.",2746.21,1.334
"Mr. Spicer: Thank you, I appreciate the timeline.",2747.544,2.136
I&amp;#39;m well aware of when it was.,2749.68,1.334
"But my point is, is you seem to be rushing",2751.014,1.936
to her defense.,2752.95,1.568
"At some point, she came on -- she went on television",2754.518,2.269
and talked about actions that he and her colleagues,2756.787,2.836
took to spread classified information.,2759.623,2.536
"And instead of -- Jonathan, instead of",2762.159,1.702
"defending her, it might be worth asking her what",2763.861,2.602
"she&amp;#39;s talking about, who she spread it to, why she",2766.463,2.269
"did it, was it appropriate, who",2768.732,1.602
cleared her to do it.,2770.334,1.234
Maybe those are questions you can ask instead of,2771.568,1.802
asking me to defend why a former Obama,2773.37,2.402
administration official is revealing stuff that,2775.772,2.236
should be extremely concerning.,2778.008,1.335
So I&amp;#39;m going to go back to --,2779.343,1.868
"The Press: Yeah, one",2781.211,0.935
"other question, which is, are you more concerned",2782.146,1.801
about that or Russian interference in the,2783.947,2.87
presidential election?,2786.817,1.101
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think that there -- as an",2787.918,3.337
American citizen I&amp;#39;m very concerned about the fact,2791.255,2.636
that people potentially were sharing information,2793.891,3.37
about other Americans for political purposes and,2797.261,2.669
using classified information to do,2799.93,2.669
so and leaking it.,2802.599,1.235
That should be concerning to everybody.,2803.834,1.435
The Press: So the Russian interference --,2805.269,1.334
"Mr. Spicer: No, that&amp;#39;s not what I said.",2806.603,1.335
Please stop trying to -- it&amp;#39;s not --,2807.938,1.401
The Press: My question is which is worse?,2809.339,1.402
"Mr. Spicer: And I guess I don&amp;#39;t -- I mean, the",2810.741,1.968
"answer is, I think if someone is interfering",2812.709,1.535
"with our election, that&amp;#39;s not good.",2814.244,1.535
I don&amp;#39;t think that someone revealing and leaking,2815.779,2.503
classified information is good either.,2818.282,1.434
I&amp;#39;m not sure that you should have to choose.,2819.716,1.969
I think that you can have outrage and concern for,2821.685,3.804
"both, and I don&amp;#39;t think we should have to pick as an",2825.489,1.902
American whether or not -- which freedom we want,2827.391,2.702
to have undermined.,2830.093,1.602
I think we should accept both of them.,2831.695,1.869
And so the idea that we should have to choose,2833.564,3.069
whether or not we want someone to interfere with,2836.633,2.069
our election or protect our civil liberties isn&amp;#39;t,2838.702,2.236
one that we should want or that we should,2840.938,1.701
have questioned.,2842.639,0.668
Alexis.,2843.307,0.667
The Press: Can I just ask three basic kind of,2843.974,3.37
follow-up to questions.,2847.344,1.101
You&amp;#39;ve used two phrases here today.,2848.445,2.236
One is really pretty sensitive information and,2850.681,2.602
the other is classified information when you&amp;#39;re,2853.283,2.569
talking about what the President believes,2855.852,2.236
was released.,2858.088,0.734
"Because you said yesterday that you, yourself, had",2858.822,2.97
not seen the information -- and that&amp;#39;s my,2861.792,2.969
understanding of today -- are those terms,2864.761,2.603
"interchangeable, or are they different in terms of",2867.364,2.97
what you know from the podium was released?,2870.334,2.969
Mr. Spicer: So there&amp;#39;s actually a,2873.303,2.303
classification level.,2875.606,1.901
There is certain sensitive information on,2877.507,3.771
"individuals, while not classified, is",2881.278,4.438
considered stuff that the government protects.,2885.716,2.269
"Then there&amp;#39;s secret, there&amp;#39;s top secret, and --",2887.985,2.435
without getting into it -- there&amp;#39;s a lot higher.,2890.42,2.77
There are differences in classification levels.,2893.19,1.868
So while you may not reveal a piece of,2895.058,2.002
"classified information, what they call PII",2897.06,3.17
"information, is sensitive information, according to",2900.23,2.436
the government standards.,2902.666,1.068
So they are different.,2903.734,1.635
Each of them has a different,2905.369,0.767
classification level.,2906.136,0.834
The Press: But it&amp;#39;s your understanding -- you&amp;#39;ve,2906.97,1.902
been told that the material that the,2908.872,2.403
President is sharing with the committees includes,2911.275,2.535
classified information as well as politically,2913.81,2.136
sensitive information -- that&amp;#39;s your understanding?,2915.946,2.169
Mr. Spicer: Yes.,2918.115,1.067
The Press: All right.,2919.182,1.435
Next question -- you said Congressman Schiff,2920.617,2.536
is coming today?,2923.153,1.068
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s my -- I know that he had -- I,2924.221,3.403
don&amp;#39;t -- he has made contact and is trying,2927.624,2.636
to arrange a time.,2930.26,1.168
The Press: And can you share with us who will be,2931.428,3.47
"responsible for escorting him to the proper place,",2934.898,3.804
"showing him the materials, walking him through it,",2938.702,3.07
letting him absorb it?,2941.772,1.067
Is he bringing staff?,2942.839,0.668
Can you just explain the --,2943.507,1.001
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t,2944.508,1.001
know the answer to that question.,2945.509,1.334
"I know that they were arranging a time,",2946.843,1.902
et cetera.,2948.745,0.668
I think it&amp;#39;s going to -- a lot of it will detail who,2949.413,2.903
-- if he is requesting it.,2952.316,1.668
I don&amp;#39;t know the nature of -- I know that the request,2953.984,2.936
"was made, and that&amp;#39;s one that -- there&amp;#39;s follow-up",2956.92,3.737
with the staff at the staff level to determine,2960.657,2.069
all those things.,2962.726,0.767
The Press: The two that the President has wanted,2963.493,2.336
to share with the House and the Senate committees,2965.829,2.603
-- has it already been shared with the FBI or,2968.432,2.335
does the FBI already have the material?,2970.767,1.835
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know the answer to that.,2972.602,1.702
Some of it -- I don&amp;#39;t know.,2974.304,2.436
It&amp;#39;s NSC -- NSC pulls materials from the various,2976.74,3.303
"agencies, so where that all came from -- is it a",2980.043,4.538
"single source, is it a combination of those -- I",2984.581,2.736
don&amp;#39;t know the answer to that.,2987.317,0.868
The Press: Can you get the answer to that?,2988.185,1.368
Mr. Spicer: I can ask.,2989.553,1.134
"Again, part of it is there&amp;#39;s a question of",2990.687,2.069
whether or not we have the ability or the release it.,2992.756,3.337
"And again, as much as I appreciate where it came",2996.093,3.003
"from, I think, again, I go back to does",2999.096,1.901
it really matter?,3000.997,1.335
"Does it matter if it came from the CIA or the NSA,",3002.332,3.237
"or another three-letter agency, or is the issue,",3005.569,4.104
"Alexis, whether or not, as I&amp;#39;ve said before --",3009.673,2.269
whether or not there is a concern about what that,3011.942,2.736
"information is doing, who used it improperly, what",3014.678,2.703
possibly could have happened.,3017.381,1.034
"I mean, again, it&amp;#39;s where it came from.",3018.415,2.069
"The Press: What I&amp;#39;m asking is, the executive branch",3020.484,3.169
-- the FBI has a separate investigation.,3023.653,2.169
I&amp;#39;m asking -- the President believes he has,3025.822,2.937
"evidence that is germane to that investigation, as",3028.759,2.936
broad as Director Comey has described.,3031.695,2.169
"Mr. Spicer: Well, first of all, just so we&amp;#39;re clear,",3033.864,3.67
"the FBI&amp;#39;s investigation pertains specifically to,",3037.534,2.903
"from what the Director said in open testimony,",3040.437,2.302
to Russia.,3042.739,0.668
What the President&amp;#39;s -- this is not what I believe,3043.407,3.303
they are investigating or --,3046.71,1.334
The Press: I misunderstood.,3048.044,0.701
I thought that the FBI also had broadened the,3048.745,2.302
investigation beyond just simply Russia.,3051.047,2.236
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know.,3053.283,2.302
I&amp;#39;m not aware of that.,3055.585,0.868
The Press: If you could just find out --,3056.453,1.635
Mr. Spicer: You can call the FBI.,3058.088,2.636
I&amp;#39;m not going to call the FBI and ask them what,3060.724,2.002
"their investigation is, and then you&amp;#39;ll write a",3062.726,1.334
story about how I called the FBI.,3064.06,1.435
The Press: I&amp;#39;m asking you a separate question.,3065.495,2.202
Does the President believe that it is important for,3067.697,2.47
the FBI to have the information that he finds,3070.167,2.502
"to be so egregiously offensive, that",3072.669,1.668
politically sensitive information was shared by,3074.337,1.669
the previous administration?,3076.006,0.801
I&amp;#39;m asking you a really simple question.,3076.807,1.935
"Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t -- no, it&amp;#39;s not.",3078.742,1.802
"You think it&amp;#39;s simple, but I think the reality is it",3080.544,2.168
"depends where it came from, who can share it.",3082.712,3.104
You&amp;#39;re acting as though it&amp;#39;s a very -- you&amp;#39;re,3085.816,2.702
acting as though it&amp;#39;s a very simple process.,3088.518,2.403
"It depends on the level of classification, who it",3090.921,2.802
"came from, whether they have the",3093.723,1.402
authority to share it.,3095.125,1.601
There&amp;#39;s a lot of things that go into this.,3096.726,1.469
And I know that it sounds really easy; it&amp;#39;s not.,3098.195,3.603
And I think that there -- I know that a lot of times,3101.798,2.836
that just because it can get leaked out doesn&amp;#39;t,3104.634,1.902
mean it&amp;#39;s being handled appropriately.,3106.536,1.535
And I think there is a desire to make sure that,3108.071,2.369
this is done correctly and within the proper guidance,3110.44,3.103
"of who has the authority to see the right things,",3113.543,2.536
and that all of the procedures are followed.,3116.079,2.436
"That doesn&amp;#39;t mean we just get to, willy-nilly, pick",3118.515,2.669
stuff and send it around to whoever.,3121.184,1.769
There is a reason that certain information is,3122.953,1.801
"handled the way it is, so that we protect the",3124.754,2.203
methods and processes that are in accordance with the,3126.957,2.869
intelligence community. John.,3129.826,1.168
"The Press: This morning, the Republican Chairman of",3130.994,6.44
the House Oversight Government Reform,3137.434,1.501
"Committee, Jason Chaffetz of Utah, took issue with",3138.935,2.703
the President&amp;#39;s tweet.,3141.638,1.001
He said he does not believe that the Russian,3142.639,3.003
"investigation that&amp;#39;s being conducted by the FBI, by",3145.642,2.669
"the Senate Intelligence Committee, by the House",3148.311,2.369
Intelligence Committee is a witch hunt.,3150.68,2.169
Why does the President believe it&amp;#39;s a witch hunt?,3152.849,2.803
He also said -- before I get your answer to that --,3155.652,3.704
he also said that he doesn&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s proper,3159.356,2.969
for the President to sort of tweet out or comment on,3162.325,3.704
ongoing investigations.,3166.029,1.034
Can you also touch on that as well?,3167.063,3.971
Mr. Spicer: I think part of this sometimes comes,3171.034,2.169
down to who has access to what information and what,3173.203,2.035
they&amp;#39;re looking at.,3175.238,1.101
"So I don&amp;#39;t know what he has seen or not seen, or",3176.339,2.803
whether it&amp;#39;s appropriate.,3179.142,0.701
"But again, I think there&amp;#39;s a whole -- the reason that",3179.843,2.402
we&amp;#39;ve asked the House and Senate Intelligence,3182.245,1.535
Committees to look into this is to make sure that,3183.78,2.102
"we get to the bottom of it in an appropriate,",3185.882,2.469
proper manner.,3188.351,0.701
"The Press: Commenting on an ongoing investigation,",3189.052,3.003
is that proper by the President?,3192.055,1.969
Mr. Spicer: What ongoing?,3194.024,0.767
"The Press: Well, there&amp;#39;s an investigation that&amp;#39;s",3194.791,1.401
ongoing by the FBI right now.,3196.192,1.769
There&amp;#39;s an ongoing investigation that&amp;#39;s,3197.961,1.335
ongoing by the Senate Intelligence Committee.,3199.296,1.368
Mr. Spicer: Okay.,3200.664,0.667
And --,3201.331,0.667
The Press: Should he be commenting on that?,3201.998,1.569
Mr. Spicer: And which comment are you referring to?,3203.567,1.334
The Press: The &amp;quot;witch hunt.&amp;quot;,3204.901,0.668
"Mr. Spicer: Right, but I think when you -- as I",3205.569,2.235
"just said to Alexis, I think there&amp;#39;s a difference",3207.804,1.635
between the investigations that have been discussed,3209.439,4.037
about Russia that we&amp;#39;ve been very clear about and,3213.476,3.104
a discussion about whether something -- as Devin,3216.58,1.835
"Nunes has said very publicly, the information",3218.415,2.469
that he had with respect to surveillance during the,3220.884,2.936
2016 election cycle had nothing to do with Russia.,3223.82,3.437
So there&amp;#39;s this seeming assumption that -- what,3227.257,3.537
the President has talked about is very clear --,3230.794,2.569
there is an ongoing pattern and more and more,3233.363,3.537
revelations that what we have seen is that,3236.9,2.736
"something potentially was very, very bad that&amp;#39;s",3239.636,2.669
happening and people were using classified,3242.305,1.602
"information -- not with respect to Russia, but to",3243.907,2.469
surveil people during that cycle.,3246.376,1.802
And that is adversely different.,3248.178,1.468
There is no -- as far as I know -- we&amp;#39;ve asked the,3249.646,3.17
House and the Senate Intelligence Committees to,3252.816,1.468
look into this whole matter -- there is no,3254.284,1.735
&amp;quot;investigation&amp;quot; that I&amp;#39;m aware of.,3256.019,1.735
The Press: You take issue with Jason Chaffetz&amp;#39;s --,3257.754,2.803
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t -- I&amp;#39;ll let him,3260.557,2.002
speak for himself.,3262.559,1.068
"My point is, though, there is obviously -- I believe",3263.627,2.769
Chairman Nunes and others who have looked into this,3266.396,1.768
and see the information are probably in a much,3268.164,2.403
better position to discuss the situation at hand and,3270.567,3.37
understand what&amp;#39;s happening.,3273.937,0.867
I&amp;#39;m going to go to Edward Marshall from,3274.804,1.368
WBBM in Chicago.,3276.172,1.635
"The Press: Actually, it&amp;#39;s Derrick Blakley at WBBM in",3277.807,4.538
Chicago.,3282.345,0.701
Thank you.,3283.046,0.667
"I have a question, and if at all possible, a",3283.713,1.702
follow-up as well.,3285.415,1.068
Chicago gets about $12 million a year in law,3286.483,3.236
enforcement assistance from the,3289.719,1.435
federal government.,3291.154,0.734
Would President Trump cut off those funds due to the,3291.888,3.003
sanctuary city status even though it would greatly,3294.891,3.37
"hamper the police fight against street violence,",3298.261,2.636
something the President has repeatedly said,3300.897,3.07
troubles him greatly?,3303.967,1.535
"Mr. Spicer: I think that you -- it&amp;#39;s interesting,",3305.502,3.27
you talk about street violence and then we cut,3308.772,2.969
off the funding for sanctuary cities.,3311.741,1.335
I think it would be interesting to want to,3313.076,2.202
send more money to a city that is allowing people to,3315.278,3.637
"come into the country who are breaking the law, who,",3318.915,2.569
"in many cases, are committing crimes --",3321.484,2.036
member of gangs.,3323.52,0.8
And so you can&amp;#39;t be a sanctuary city and at the,3324.32,4.705
same time seem to pretend or express concern about,3329.025,3.937
law enforcement or ask for more money when probably a,3332.962,2.803
number of the funds that you&amp;#39;re using in the first,3335.765,1.802
place are going to law enforcement to handle the,3337.567,3.937
situation that you&amp;#39;ve created for yourself.,3341.504,1.969
I think the President&amp;#39;s belief on sanctuary cities,3343.473,2.703
is one shared by upwards of 80 percent of the,3346.176,2.369
American people that we shouldn&amp;#39;t be using,3348.545,1.902
American tax dollars to fund cities and counties,3350.447,2.435
"and, in some cases, potentially states that",3352.882,2.97
are seeking to allow people who are not legally,3355.852,3.203
"in this country, who potentially can do us",3359.055,1.869
"harm, to get funding.",3360.924,1.668
And so I think there&amp;#39;s no question -- it&amp;#39;s not a,3362.592,1.969
question of what he will do.,3364.561,1.902
His intentions have been very clear from the,3366.463,1.635
beginning.,3368.098,0.667
I think it&amp;#39;s vastly supported by the vast,3368.765,2.269
majority of the American people.,3371.034,1.334
But I think that to suggest that somehow,3372.368,1.836
they&amp;#39;re not inextricably linked is a failure to,3374.204,3.803
fully appreciate the scenario.,3378.007,1.569
The Press: Can I follow up?,3379.576,2.369
Does that mean the President is more,3381.945,2.769
interested in deporting illegal immigrants than he,3384.714,2.736
is with putting shooters and killers in jail?,3387.45,3.137
Mr. Spicer: No.,3390.587,1.268
Because if a shooter or killer is here illegally,3391.855,3.169
"and he&amp;#39;s in this country, then I think that --",3395.024,1.869
"again, I think, respectfully, you&amp;#39;re",3396.893,1.902
delinking the two issues.,3398.795,1.635
If you have people who are in this country illegally,3400.43,2.002
"that are part of a gang, that are part of --",3402.432,3.003
they&amp;#39;re committing -- a threat to public safety or,3405.435,1.635
"committing a crime, then funding that activity and",3407.07,4.171
allowing that to fester is in itself a problem.,3411.241,2.903
And so by not rooting that out in the first place is,3414.144,2.469
allowing the problem to continue and not exactly,3416.613,3.069
showing an attempt to solve it in,3419.682,2.103
the first place.,3421.785,1.501
Blake.,3423.286,0.667
The Press: Let me ask you about the two executive,3423.953,2.069
orders that are about to be signed.,3426.022,1.702
Peter Navarro said this morning that they have,3427.724,1.968
nothing to do with the China trip next week.,3429.692,3.971
So is it just purely coincidence that it&amp;#39;s,3433.663,1.535
happening now and the President is set to meet,3435.198,2.436
with his counterpart in China next week?,3437.634,2.135
Or is this somewhat setting the table for what,3439.769,2.469
might come next week?,3442.238,0.734
"Mr. Spicer: No, I think they are both broad-based.",3442.972,1.569
"I mean, countervailing duties is not something",3444.541,3.536
that&amp;#39;s targeted at any specific country.,3448.077,2.803
So I don&amp;#39;t think that you could use that as some,3450.88,5.306
kind of indication of any one country.,3456.186,3.303
I think we&amp;#39;re giving up $2.8 billion a year and,3459.489,3.437
that&amp;#39;s coming through our borders all across.,3462.926,3.403
So that one.,3466.329,0.734
And the other one specifically talks about,3467.063,2.369
every form of trade abuse and non-reciprocal,3469.432,2.803
practice that are currently contributing,3472.235,1.802
to our deficit.,3474.037,0.7
So there&amp;#39;s a lot of countries that contribute,3474.737,1.335
"to that, and I think a lot of times the trade",3476.072,1.335
agreements that we&amp;#39;ve made in some cases haven&amp;#39;t been,3477.407,1.368
looked at or revived in a very long time.,3478.775,1.334
And so for either one of them to be suggested at,3480.109,1.335
any particular country would be a misread,3481.444,1.335
of either one.,3482.779,0.734
The Press: You mentioned that the President has,3483.513,4.938
"signaled his intention to withdraw from TPP, you&amp;#39;ve",3488.451,4.905
"got Keystone, you&amp;#39;ve got these executive orders, a",3493.356,2.703
whole host of others.,3496.059,1.101
The second executive order that&amp;#39;s coming today talks,3497.16,2.235
about a -- or the first one -- a 90-day review.,3499.395,3.037
Mr. Spicer: Yes.,3502.432,0.834
The Press: The one that&amp;#39;s still outstanding is NAFTA,3503.266,2.436
and what the President wants to do with that.,3505.702,2.369
So does that move the NAFTA timeline potentially,3508.071,2.803
back 90 days?,3510.874,0.9
Does he want to see this 90-day review first,3511.774,2.603
before getting to NAFTA?,3514.377,1.368
Mr. Spicer: I think the first thing he wants to do,3515.745,3.504
is get Robert Lighthizer confirmed as the next U.S.,3519.249,2.402
Trade Representative so that we can have someone,3521.651,1.335
at the helm of that agency to really shepherd the,3522.986,1.334
trade agenda and help with the priorities.,3524.32,1.335
I know that Peter and Secretary Ross were here,3525.655,2.169
"yesterday, and Secretary Ross and Secretary Mnuchin",3527.824,2.669
and others have been very involved,3530.493,2.035
in the trade agenda.,3532.528,0.668
But we really need someone in the front of the ship,3533.196,2.235
to help us guide us through it.,3535.431,1.335
And that review and others are part of that.,3536.766,2.169
Major.,3538.935,0.667
The Press: Do you have a timeline?,3539.602,1.335
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t.,3540.937,0.901
The Press: You frequently tell us to take the,3541.838,1.668
President&amp;#39;s tweets at face value and they,3543.506,2.035
speak for themselves.,3545.541,0.801
So when the President says Mike Flynn should get,3546.342,2.136
"immunity, is he suggesting to Congress that it",3548.478,2.836
grant immunity?,3551.314,0.801
Mr. Spicer: I think Mike Flynn and his legal,3552.115,2.402
counsel should do what&amp;#39;s appropriate for,3554.517,1.502
Mike Flynn.,3556.019,0.667
"The Press: Right, but that is -- they cannot",3556.686,1.535
obtain immunity.,3558.221,0.767
"It must be granted -- Mr. Spicer: Right, and",3558.988,1.769
again to your question --,3560.757,0.901
The Press: -- by Congress.,3561.658,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Right.,3562.325,0.701
The Press: You have the President recommending,3563.026,1.334
either to the FBI or to Congress that it,3564.36,1.335
grant immunity.,3565.695,0.667
Because that&amp;#39;s the only way it can happen.,3566.362,1.335
Mr. Spicer: I understand that.,3567.697,0.667
"But again, he didn&amp;#39;t say Congress should grant, and",3568.364,1.402
I think --,3569.766,0.667
The Press: That&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m asking.,3570.433,1.368
What does he mean by that?,3571.801,0.667
Mr. Spicer: And I think that his -- what he means,3572.468,1.335
is he support Mike Flynn&amp;#39;s attempts to go up to,3573.803,1.335
Congress and be very clear with everything that,3575.138,2.235
they ask and what they want.,3577.373,1.068
The Press: Right.,3578.441,0.667
But he could have just said &amp;quot;and testify.&amp;quot;,3579.108,2.136
He said he should be immunity.,3581.244,1.702
"Mr. Spicer: Right., The Press: And I&amp;#39;m asking you",3582.946,1.334
because it&amp;#39;s an important --,3584.28,0.668
Mr. Spicer: It is.,3584.948,0.667
The Press: Every lawyer who works on this tells,3585.615,1.368
you it&amp;#39;s extremely important to seek it,3586.983,2.169
and then obtain it.,3589.152,0.734
"And there&amp;#39;s only one way you can seek it, by it",3589.886,2.202
being granted either by the FBI or by Congress.,3592.088,1.935
And for the President of the United States to even,3594.023,2.136
lightly indicate that he is in favor of that,3596.159,1.902
it seems to is a significant development.,3598.061,1.501
And I&amp;#39;m trying to find out if that&amp;#39;s what the,3599.562,2.136
President was trying to accomplish.,3601.698,1.334
Mr. Spicer: And I think what -- and I&amp;#39;m trying to,3603.032,2.102
"answer the question, which is that I think that what",3605.134,2.469
-- not that I think -- I&amp;#39;ve talked to the,3607.603,1.836
President about this.,3609.439,0.667
I think what he -- The Press: You have?,3610.106,1.335
Mr. Spicer: Yes.,3611.441,0.667
And the President is very clear that he wants Mike,3612.108,1.368
Flynn to go and be completely open and,3613.476,2.536
transparent with the committee.,3616.012,1.668
"And whatever it takes to do that, he is supportive of.",3617.68,2.102
The Press: Even if he doesn&amp;#39;t obtain immunity?,3619.782,1.602
"Mr. Spicer: He wants him to -- again, I want to be",3621.384,2.769
"clear, he wants him to do what is necessary to go up",3624.153,3.871
there and talk to the committees of jurisdiction,3628.024,3.036
to get this matter behind us.,3631.06,1.035
The Press: And since you&amp;#39;ve talked to the,3632.095,1.334
"President about this, he was not trying to suggest",3633.429,1.468
to the FBI or the Justice Department that it grant,3634.897,2.403
immunity to Mike Flynn?,3637.3,1.001
"Mr. Spicer: No, I think he was -- I&amp;#39;m not entirely",3638.301,2.736
sure of the process -- whether the Congress does,3641.037,2.703
"it, or DOJ, or both in this case.",3643.74,1.334
But the point that --,3645.074,1.769
The Press: -- any other venue --,3646.843,1.334
"Mr. Spicer: I get it, but the --",3648.177,1.335
The Press: It would be different.,3649.512,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: Right, I understand.",3650.847,1.368
Right.,3652.215,0.667
But the bottom line is --,3652.882,0.667
The Press: He&amp;#39;s not instructing his Justice,3653.549,1.335
Department to do this?,3654.884,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: No, what he is instructing is Mike Flynn",3655.551,1.335
to do everything he can to cooperate with the,3656.886,1.335
committees that he&amp;#39;s asked to look into this.,3658.221,1.334
Zeke.,3659.555,0.701
The Press: You talked about -- one more thing.,3660.256,1.335
You said Congressman Schiff is coming over,3661.591,1.334
"here, the Senate Intelligence --",3662.925,1.335
Mr. Spicer: And let me just be clear because I,3664.26,1.335
"know -- before you continue, I just want",3665.595,1.334
to be crystal clear.,3666.929,0.668
I know that he&amp;#39;s communicated.,3667.597,0.667
Our expectation is -- I don&amp;#39;t -- The Press: He,3668.264,1.368
said he was --,3669.632,0.667
The Press: He put out a press release.,3670.299,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: Well, there we go.",3671.634,0.667
"Thank you, Zeke.",3672.301,0.668
The Press: You just cleared up a lot of --,3672.969,1.334
Mr. Spicer: I know.,3674.303,0.668
But sometimes you --,3674.971,0.667
The Press: The Senate,3675.638,0.667
Intelligence Committee put out a statement yesterday,3676.305,1.368
that I just want to read to you -- or part of it.,3677.673,1.335
Mr. Spicer: Yes.,3679.008,0.667
The Press: The committee has asked the White House,3679.675,1.335
to direct the agencies that own the intelligence,3681.01,1.335
documents in question to immediately provide them,3682.345,1.334
directly to the committee.,3683.679,0.868
"Does the White House have any problem with that, or",3684.547,2.603
believe they&amp;#39;re --,3687.15,0.767
Mr. Spicer: I think we&amp;#39;re looking into that.,3687.917,2.069
"I think obviously we would have hoped that, like",3689.986,2.269
"Congressman Schiff, they would come and",3692.255,1.368
see these documents.,3693.623,1.334
I don&amp;#39;t know.,3694.957,0.668
I know that the counsel&amp;#39;s office is in contact with,3695.625,2.269
them with respect to that.,3697.894,1.134
The Press: Do you see any problem,3699.028,2.136
with this procedure?,3701.164,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not -- Major, respectfully, the",3701.831,1.435
counsel&amp;#39;s office is working with them.,3703.266,1.334
I don&amp;#39;t want to get in front of what the -- how,3704.6,1.969
they go back and forth and make a decision on that.,3706.569,1.702
The Press: It&amp;#39;s not an illegitimate request.,3708.271,1.668
"The Press: Schiff is asking the same thing, too?",3709.939,1.802
The Press: Is this an illegitimate request?,3711.741,1.401
That&amp;#39;s all I&amp;#39;m trying to figure out.,3713.142,1.402
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know.,3714.544,1.067
I don&amp;#39;t know.,3715.611,0.668
It&amp;#39;s not -- I think -- I want to say the goal would be --,3716.279,3.136
The Press: -- you said we don&amp;#39;t know who owns it.,3719.415,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: Again, I&amp;#39;m letting -- the White House",3720.75,1.335
Counsel&amp;#39;s Office sent that letter.,3722.085,1.334
They are the ones whom those individuals have,3723.419,1.835
been in contact with.,3725.254,1.202
"Obviously, we&amp;#39;d like them to come see that",3726.456,1.434
"information, which is what we think would help them",3727.89,3.103
further their review of this situation.,3730.993,1.602
The Press: (Inaudible.),3732.595,0.767
Mr. Spicer: I understand that.,3733.362,1.268
"But what I&amp;#39;m telling you is it&amp;#39;s not my decision, Major.",3734.63,2.636
This is a discussion that is occurring between both,3737.266,2.703
of those committees and,3739.969,1.502
the White House Counsel&amp;#39;s Office.,3741.471,1.334
"The Press: I&amp;#39;m just asking, as the",3742.805,1.335
"representative of the President, because",3744.14,1.335
it is his decision --,3745.475,0.7
Mr. Spicer: I understand that.,3746.175,0.868
"And as you&amp;#39;re telling me, it&amp;#39;s happening in real",3747.043,1.334
time -- the Schiff piece of it happening in real time.,3748.377,2.236
I don&amp;#39;t know the answer because it&amp;#39;s happening,3750.613,2.569
while we&amp;#39;re here.,3753.182,1.101
So I don&amp;#39;t have an answer for us on that.,3754.283,2.636
The White House Counsel&amp;#39;s Office is in communication,3756.919,2.336
"with the committee, in particular, and with",3759.255,1.668
Congressman Schiff&amp;#39;s office about arranging how,3760.923,2.836
that would go down.,3763.759,0.901
I don&amp;#39;t know what further discussions they&amp;#39;ve had,3764.66,1.836
since we&amp;#39;ve been out here.,3766.496,1.167
The Press: So really quick just to follow up.,3767.663,2.77
You said that the U.S.,3770.433,1.101
is giving up $2.8 billion a year in countervailing --,3771.534,2.436
Mr. Spicer: Right.,3773.97,0.767
The Press: Peter Navarro was up here last night and,3774.737,2.436
said that sum applied to a 16-year period.,3777.173,1.969
I was hoping you could clarify the facts on that.,3779.142,2.469
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t -- I&amp;#39;ll ask Peter to --,3781.611,2.469
The Press: Peter Navarro had it as a far smaller sum,3784.08,2.702
over a larger --,3786.782,0.968
"Mr. Spicer: Right, I&amp;#39;ll have to ask Peter to --",3787.75,1.802
The Press: Thanks.,3789.552,0.667
"The second thing, follow-up on Alexis&amp;#39;s question.",3790.219,1.335
You&amp;#39;ve made some serious allegations about civil,3791.554,2.502
liberties and potentially mishandling of,3794.056,2.203
classified information.,3796.259,0.934
"Why wouldn&amp;#39;t the White House, if it believed --",3797.193,2.436
hand it over to the federal agency tasked with,3799.629,3.737
investigating crimes --,3803.366,1.234
"Mr. Spicer: Again, I&amp;#39;m not",3804.6,1.769
"-- that&amp;#39;s not -- because I think -- first of all, I",3806.369,2.702
"don&amp;#39;t know what we will or will not do going forward,",3809.071,2.369
and I don&amp;#39;t want to prejudge that.,3811.44,1.335
What I do know is that the House and Senate,3812.775,1.535
Intelligence Committees are both the committees,3814.31,3.67
that we -- the President had asked on that Sunday a,3817.98,2.303
few weeks ago to look into this.,3820.283,1.701
And I think that&amp;#39;s who is conducting and who&amp;#39;ve we&amp;#39;d,3821.984,2.036
asked to look into it.,3824.02,0.934
And that&amp;#39;s appropriate.,3824.954,1.168
And I&amp;#39;m not aware that anyone else asked us,3826.122,1.968
for that information.,3828.09,0.668
The Press: And one final one.,3828.758,1.334
Earlier in the briefing you said we don&amp;#39;t track,3830.092,1.902
every -- we don&amp;#39;t track every person who is,3831.994,2.002
on the 18 acres --,3833.996,1.402
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, no, he asked about",3835.398,2.369
whether or not the Chief of Staff knew everyone who,3837.767,2.269
was on the 18 acres.,3840.036,1.668
That&amp;#39;s what he asked.,3841.704,0.767
"The Press: So -- but when it comes to that, do you",3842.471,3.604
have any information about how the Chairman did get,3846.075,2.603
"onto the campus, who WAVEd him in?",3848.678,1.768
"Mr. Spicer: As I said over the last few days, I&amp;#39;m not",3850.446,2.636
going to discuss --,3853.082,0.734
"The Press: Will you release -- sorry, the WAVES records?",3853.816,2.169
"Mr. Spicer: Yes, I think all of that is going to",3855.985,1.368
happen as soon as -- there will be a discussion about,3857.353,2.402
a lot of in the briefing that&amp;#39;s going to talk about,3859.755,2.169
the financial disclosure forms and such as,3861.924,2.87
immediately as this concludes.,3864.794,1.668
Part of that.,3866.462,0.734
"So with that, thank you, guys, very much.",3867.196,1.735
So we&amp;#39;re going to get onto the next briefing.,3868.931,1.535
Thank you very much.,3870.466,0.634
