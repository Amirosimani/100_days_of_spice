Mr. Spicer: Hey guys.,1.368,2.802
I brought a guest.,4.17,1.769
(laughter),5.939,2.702
Good afternoon.,8.641,1.502
"First off at the top, I want to acknowledge that",10.143,3.27
there&amp;#39;s been an additional wave of threats to Jewish,13.413,2.936
community centers and Anti-Defamation League offices.,16.349,4.171
According to some reports there have been over 100,20.52,1.869
bomb threats phoned in to Jewish institutions,22.389,1.634
since the start of this year alone.,25.158,2.002
As the President said at the beginning of his joint,27.16,2.135
"address, &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re a country that stands united in",29.295,2.87
condemning hate and evil in all of its forms.&amp;quot;,32.165,3.27
We denounce these latest anti-Semitic and hateful,35.435,2.536
threats in the strongest terms.,37.971,2.068
It is incredibly saddening that I have to continue to,40.039,2.303
share these disturbing reports with you and I,42.342,3.103
share the President&amp;#39;s thoughts that he fervently,45.445,2.135
hopes that we don&amp;#39;t continue to have to share,47.58,2.203
these reports with you.,49.783,1.968
But as long as they will -- as long as they do,51.751,1.935
"continue, we will continue to condemn them and look",53.686,3.237
at ways in which we can stop them.,56.923,2.569
"Now, onto news of the day.",59.492,2.036
You saw President Trump yesterday continue to,61.528,1.801
deliver on two of his most significant campaign,63.329,2.636
"promises, protecting the country against radical",65.965,2.603
Islamic terrorism and repealing and replacing,68.568,3.136
Obamacare with a patient-centric alternative.,71.704,4.038
We talked a lot about the Executive Order protecting,75.742,2.436
the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the,78.178,2.035
United States yesterday and so on to Obamacare.,80.213,3.537
I&amp;#39;d like to introduce the Secretary of Health and,83.75,3.37
"Human Services, Dr. Tom Price, to come up and talk",87.12,2.235
to you a little bit about the plan to repeal and,89.355,2.203
replace Obamacare.,91.558,1.001
Dr. Price.,92.559,0.767
"Secretary Price: Thank you, Sean.",93.326,3.804
Good afternoon.,97.13,0.667
First let me share with you what an honor it is to,97.797,2.803
serve as the Secretary of Health and Human Services.,100.6,2.302
I&amp;#39;m the third physician out of 23 individuals who,102.902,3.17
have had the privilege of serving as the Secretary,106.072,1.869
of Health and Human Services.,107.941,1.801
And the mission at our department is to improve,109.742,2.336
the health and safety and well-being of the American,112.078,2.336
"people and we take that mission very, very",114.414,2.669
seriously.,117.083,1.301
"And for many Americans right now, their ability",118.384,2.903
to gain healthcare or health coverage is a real,121.287,3.17
challenge.,124.457,1.368
"For most Americans, they receive their health",125.825,2.069
coverage through their employer.,127.894,1.501
It&amp;#39;s about 175 million folks.,129.395,1.969
Those individuals will see no significant change,131.364,2.503
other than there won&amp;#39;t be a penalty for not,133.867,2.168
purchasing coverage.,136.035,2.803
For the folks in the Medicare system there will,138.838,1.802
be no changes at all in the current law.,140.64,3.604
But we&amp;#39;re talking about those people in the,144.244,1.501
"individual and small-group market, the moms and pops.",145.745,3.67
The folks who run the corner grocery store or,149.415,2.036
the corner cleaners.,151.451,1.501
Those individuals out there are having huge,152.952,2.236
challenges gaining care and gaining coverage.,155.188,3.036
"And then Medicaid is a program that, by and",158.224,1.835
"large, has decreased the ability for folks to gain",160.059,2.403
access to care and we want to make certain,162.462,1.835
that we address that.,164.297,0.867
This is about patients.,165.164,2.67
This is not about money.,167.834,1.134
This is not about something else.,168.968,1.835
This is about patients.,170.803,2.136
"And, sadly, the costs are going up for those in the",172.939,2.436
"individual and small-group market, the access is",175.375,1.968
"going down, and it&amp;#39;s only getting worse.",177.343,2.036
You know the stories.,179.379,1.368
Premiums increased 25 percent over the last year,180.747,2.669
on average; Arizona had an increase of 116 percent.,183.416,4.037
"Deductibles are going up for many, many folks; if",187.453,2.303
"you&amp;#39;re a mom or a dad out there and you make 40, 50,",189.756,3.136
"60 thousand dollars, your deductible in this market,",192.892,2.903
"in that individual and small-group market, often",195.795,2.97
"times is 8, 10, 12 thousand dollars a year.",198.765,4.07
What that means is that you&amp;#39;ve got an insurance,202.835,1.635
"card, but you don&amp;#39;t get care because you can&amp;#39;t",204.47,2.903
afford the deductible.,207.373,1.302
And we know that this is happening by talking to,208.675,1.868
the folks who are out there trying to,210.543,1.335
provide the care.,211.878,1.001
A third of the counties in the United States -- one,212.879,1.802
third of the counties in the United States -- have,214.681,2.135
only one insurer offering coverage on the Exchange.,216.816,3.504
Five states only have one insurer offering,220.32,2.102
coverage on the Exchange.,222.422,1.501
"One insurer is not a choice, so we need to make",223.923,3.303
sure we correct that.,227.226,1.335
"In Tennessee, this morning, it was announced",228.561,1.702
that there are a number of counties that have no,230.263,2.402
insurer offering coverage on the Exchange.,232.665,2.536
Insurers are leaving the market on the Exchange.,235.201,3.103
"Last year, there were 232 insurers that were",238.304,2.336
providing coverage -- that were offering coverage on,240.64,2.269
the Exchange -- now there are 167.,242.909,2.903
That&amp;#39;s a loss of about 30 percent in one year alone.,245.812,3.37
And all of this means that patients are not getting,249.182,3.203
the care that they need.,252.385,1.768
Now the principals that we have as our guiding star,254.153,2.77
are affordability -- we want a system that&amp;#39;s,256.923,2.469
affordable for everybody -- accessibility -- we,259.392,2.369
need a system that&amp;#39;s accessible for everybody,261.761,1.902
"-- a system that&amp;#39;s of the highest quality, a system",263.663,2.602
that incentivizes innovation in the,266.265,1.836
"healthcare system, and a system that empowers",268.101,2.536
patients through both transparency,270.637,2.268
and accountability.,272.905,1.736
"The President spoke last week -- last Tuesday, to a",274.641,2.102
joint session of Congress and he laid,276.743,1.601
out his principals.,278.344,1.935
"First, he wanted to make certain that those with",280.279,1.635
pre-existing illness and injury were not,281.914,2.203
priced out of the market.,284.117,0.967
Nobody ought to lose their coverage because,285.084,2.369
they get a bad diagnosis.,287.453,1.202
"In terms of affordability, health savings accounts,",288.655,3.269
growing choices for patients is incredibly,291.924,2.937
"important, tax credits that allow individuals to",294.861,3.67
be able to purchase the kind of coverage that,298.531,1.535
"they want, not that the",300.066,0.934
government forces them to buy.,301,1.702
"We&amp;#39;ve always talked about, in terms of what kinds of",302.702,3.87
"reforms need to be put in place, that we need to",306.572,1.936
equalize the tax treatment,308.508,1.968
for the purchase of coverage.,310.476,1.802
"Those, again, in the employer-sponsored market,",312.278,2.403
they get a tax benefit for buying health coverage.,314.681,3.103
Those folks that are out there in the individual,317.784,1.534
and small-group market -- no tax benefit.,319.318,2.57
And that&amp;#39;s what this plan would do.,321.888,1.868
State flexibility.,323.756,0.968
It&amp;#39;s incredibly important that we allow the states,324.724,2.436
to be the ones that are defining what health,327.16,1.935
"coverage is -- have the flexibility, especially in",329.095,2.436
the Medicaid program -- to be able to respond to,331.531,2.369
their vulnerable populations.,333.9,1.935
Lawsuit abuse.,335.835,0.834
The President mentioned and it&amp;#39;s incredibly,336.669,1.535
important -- the practice of defensive medicine,338.204,2.002
wastes billions and billions of dollars every,340.206,2.302
single year and we need to make certain that we&amp;#39;re,342.508,2.102
addressing that as well.,344.61,1.702
"The President also talked about a glide path, an",346.312,2.169
appropriate transition to this new phase for health,348.481,3.937
"care for our country, and that&amp;#39;s important as well,",352.418,3.037
so that nobody falls through the cracks.,355.455,2.602
Buying across state lines -- buying insurance,358.057,2.403
across state lines.,360.46,0.7
The President talked about this on the,361.16,1.602
campaign over and over.,362.762,1.468
American people understand the common-sense nature of,364.23,2.703
purchasing across state lines and it increases,366.933,2.402
"competition, and we need to make certain",369.335,1.869
that that happens.,371.204,0.734
"And then, addressing the incredible increase",371.938,2.469
in drug prices.,374.407,1.902
There are three phases of this plan.,376.309,1.768
One is the bill that was introduced last evening in,378.077,3.103
the House of Representatives.,381.18,1.001
That&amp;#39;s the start of all of this.,382.181,1.368
Second are the regulatory modifications and changes,383.549,3.671
that can be put into place.,387.22,1.968
"As you all well know, the previous administration",389.188,2.102
used regulations to a fare-thee-well.,391.29,1.702
"In fact, there were 192 specific rules that were",392.992,3.37
"put out as they relate to Obamacare, over 5 thousand",396.362,3.737
letters of guidance and the like.,400.099,2.036
And we are going to go through every single one,402.135,1.835
of those and make certain that they -- if they help,403.97,2.736
"patients, then we need to continue them.",406.706,1.601
"If they harm patients or increase costs, then",408.307,3.304
obviously they need to be addressed.,411.611,1.868
And then there&amp;#39;s other legislation that will need,413.479,1.969
to be addressed that can&amp;#39;t be done through the,415.448,1.568
reconciliation process.,417.016,1.235
"So, the goal of all of this is patient-centered",418.251,2.636
"healthcare, where patients and families and doctors",420.887,2.435
are making medical decisions and not the,423.322,1.869
federal government.,425.191,1.234
We look -- we commend the House for the introduction,426.425,2.069
of the bill yesterday and we look forward to working,428.494,2.336
with all individuals in the process.,430.83,2.002
And I look forward to a few questions.,432.832,1.335
"Yes, sir.",434.167,0.667
"The Press: Mr. Price, you are familiar, from your",434.834,1.401
"time in the House, with the clout that",436.235,1.502
conservative groups like the Club for Growth and,437.737,2.269
Heritage action have with rank-and-file members?,440.006,2.569
What does it say about this legislation that,442.575,1.735
these groups are already out with opposition to it?,444.31,3.67
"Secretary Price: Well, I think that this is the",447.98,1.869
beginning of the process and we look forward to,449.849,2.169
working with them and others to make certain,452.018,2.035
"that, again, we come up with that process that",454.053,1.802
aligns with the principals that we&amp;#39;ve defined -- that,455.855,3.27
they actually adhere to or agree with as well -- and,459.125,3.336
that is that we need a system that&amp;#39;s affordable,462.461,1.702
"for folks, a system that&amp;#39;s accessible for",464.163,2.603
"individuals, that&amp;#39;s of the highest quality, that",466.766,2.269
"incentivizes innovation,",469.035,1.768
and that empowers patients.,470.803,1.402
And so we look forward to working with them,472.205,1.768
through this process.,473.973,0.734
"The Press: Secretary Price, Congressman",474.707,1.735
Chaffetz said it today that Americans may have to,476.442,3.17
forego a new iPhone to pay for healthcare and they&amp;#39;ll,479.612,3.503
"have to, kind of, make these choices.",483.115,2.536
Does the administration agree with that?,485.651,1.802
"Will Americans, under this plan, will they maybe need",487.453,4.204
to sacrifice other goods to pay for,491.657,2.002
their healthcare?,493.659,1.001
Secretary Price: This is an important question,494.66,1.468
"because what&amp;#39;s happening right now, is that the",496.128,1.202
American people are having to sacrifice in order to,497.33,1.868
purchase coverage.,499.198,1.268
"And as I mentioned, many individuals can&amp;#39;t afford",500.466,1.869
the kind of coverage that they have right now.,502.335,2.269
"So, they&amp;#39;ve got that insurance card, but",504.604,1.568
they don&amp;#39;t have care.,506.172,1.702
What our desire is is to drive down the healthcare,507.874,2.502
costs for everybody and the way that you do that,510.376,2.569
"is to increase choices for folks, increase",512.945,1.969
"competition, return the regulation of healthcare",514.914,2.936
to where it ought to be which is at the state,517.85,1.635
"level, not at the federal level.",519.485,2.002
"All of these things that, taken in their aggregate,",521.487,3.337
"will, in fact, decrease the cost of healthcare and",524.824,2.335
"health coverage, and that will allow folks to",527.159,3.17
purchase the coverage that they want.,530.329,1.335
"Yes, sir.",531.664,0.701
"The Press: Thank you, Doctor Price.",532.365,1.334
I have two questions for you.,533.699,1.101
The first has to do with guarantees that you can,534.8,3.137
make as the Administration&amp;#39;s point,537.937,1.835
person on this legislation.,539.772,1.435
"Can you guarantee that, whatever legislation",541.207,2.202
"emerges and makes it to the President&amp;#39;s desk, will",543.409,3.303
"allow individuals, if they like their doctor, can",546.712,2.903
keep their doctor?,549.615,1.101
And the second guarantee is can you also guarantee,550.716,2.97
that healthcare premiums for individuals will come,553.686,2.536
down with this new legislation?,556.222,1.968
"Secretary Price: Again, a remarkably important",558.19,2.336
"question, because as you recall the promise from",560.526,1.902
"the last administration was, &amp;quot;If like your doctor,",562.428,2.035
you can keep your doctor.,564.463,0.768
"If you like your plan, you can keep your plan.&amp;quot;",565.231,2.703
Both of those promises turned out to be not true.,567.934,3.036
We think it&amp;#39;s incredibly important for the American,570.97,1.935
people to be able to select the physician and,572.905,2.403
the place that they&amp;#39;re treated themselves; that,575.308,2.068
the government ought not be involved,577.376,3.003
in that process.,580.379,1.569
"And so our goal is, absolutely, to make sure",581.948,2.268
that individuals have the opportunity to select,584.216,2.069
their physician.,586.285,0.934
"In terms of premiums, we believe strongly that",587.219,4.405
"through this whole process and as it takes effect,",591.624,2.903
that we&amp;#39;ll see a decrease in not only the premiums,594.527,2.769
"that individuals will see, but a decrease in the cost",597.296,2.836
of healthcare for folks.,600.132,1.435
"Remember, that was another promise that the previous",601.567,2.669
"administration made, that you&amp;#39;d see a decrease in",604.236,2.169
"$2,500 on average for families across this land.",606.405,3.604
"In fact, what they&amp;#39;ve seen is an increase of $2,500",610.009,3.17
"or $3,000.",613.179,0.667
"So, we&amp;#39;re going to go in the other direction.",613.846,1.368
We&amp;#39;re going to go in a direction that empowers,615.214,1.401
patients and holds down costs. Yes?,616.615,1.936
"The Press: Mr. Secretary, you are quite a distance",618.551,6.173
away from conservatives with this plan in the,624.724,1.801
"central part of it, which is tax credits, which they",626.525,2.369
"see as yet another entitlement, very similar",628.894,3.771
to the entitlement of Obamacare but,632.665,1.401
different in form.,634.066,1.368
"How do you convince them, since it&amp;#39;s going to take",635.434,2.703
"tax credits to make this work, that they need to",638.137,2.402
swallow this and move forward with the bill?,640.539,2.87
"I mean, you&amp;#39;re getting an awful lot of opposition on",643.409,2.135
the central tenet of this whole thing.,645.544,3.204
Secretary Price: This is all about patients.,648.748,1.735
And in order to provide that transition and in,650.483,1.635
order to make it so that nobody falls through the,652.118,1.635
"cracks, we&amp;#39;ve got to have a system that allows for",653.753,2.035
individuals to gain the kind of coverage,655.788,1.835
that they want.,657.623,1.368
"And we, conservatives and others, have said for a",658.991,3.404
"long, long time that we believe it&amp;#39;s important to",662.395,2.002
equalize the tax treatment for those purchasing,664.397,3.269
"coverage, gaining coverage through their employer,",667.666,2.069
and those not.,669.735,1.402
And the tax credit is the opportunity to be able to,671.137,2.736
equalize that tax treatment.,673.873,2.169
"Folks have talked about this for many years,",676.042,2.402
"actually, so that there&amp;#39;s not a distortion in the",678.444,2.736
tax code for who&amp;#39;s able to gain a benefit for being,681.18,3.337
able to purchase coverage and not. Ma&amp;#39;am.,684.517,3.937
"The Press: Mr. Secretary, you were talking about",688.454,2.169
making sure people don&amp;#39;t fall through the cracks.,690.623,2.436
"The last administration, with Obamacare, focused in",693.059,2.502
on making sure the underserved were part of,695.561,2.769
the equation.,698.33,0.668
What is the safety net or the safeguard that you,698.998,3.437
have to make sure -- to ensure people don&amp;#39;t fall,702.435,2.435
"through the cracks beyond the tax incentives, but",704.87,2.403
"also for the underserved, who are now part of --",707.273,2.936
many are now part of the program that weren&amp;#39;t,710.209,2.369
"before, prior to Obamacare.",712.578,1.068
"Secretary Price: Yeah, this is extremely",713.646,1.635
important as well.,715.281,1.034
"And it&amp;#39;s -- the current system, as you likely",716.315,3.237
"know, for those vulnerable in our population,",719.552,1.801
"especially in the Medicaid population, this is a",721.353,2.269
system that&amp;#39;s broken.,723.622,1.836
You&amp;#39;ve got a third of the physicians in this country,725.458,2.135
-- one-third of the doctors in this country,727.593,1.668
that would be eligible to see Medicaid patients who,729.261,2.503
aren&amp;#39;t seeing Medicaid patients right now.,731.764,1.702
And it&amp;#39;s not because they&amp;#39;ve forgotten how to,733.466,1.768
"take care of patients, it&amp;#39;s because of the rules",735.234,2.102
that are in place that make it too onerous or too,737.336,2.803
difficult for them to see Medicaid patients.,740.139,2.202
"So, we believe that it&amp;#39;s important to allow states",742.341,2.069
to have that flexibility to fashion the program for,744.41,2.569
their vulnerable population that actually,746.979,2.136
responds to that population in a way that,749.115,2.135
"gives them the authority, them the choices, them the",751.25,2.636
opportunity to gain coverage and the care that,753.886,2.336
they believe most appropriate.,756.222,1.268
The Press: What if you find out that that is not,757.49,1.501
happening when you give it to the states?,758.991,1.802
Is there some type of punishment or some type of,760.793,2.903
piece that you&amp;#39;re going to put in place to make sure,763.696,2.803
"that that happens, that they follow through on",766.499,2.035
your intent?,768.534,0.701
"Secretary Price: Yeah, there&amp;#39;s -- absolutely.",769.235,1.568
There&amp;#39;s accountability throughout the plan that,770.803,2.402
we have that would allow for the Secretary and the,773.205,2.536
Department to be certain that the individuals that,775.741,2.469
we believe need to be cared for are being cared,778.21,2.569
for in the state at the appropriate level.,780.779,2.737
But we believe this is a partnership.,783.516,2.435
This is about patients and partnership.,785.951,2.036
The previous administration tended to,787.987,1.935
make it about government.,789.922,1.335
"We believe it&amp;#39;s about patients and partnership,",791.257,2.002
and we want to partner with every single person,793.259,1.902
in this land who wants to make certain that we allow,795.161,2.202
the kind of choices and quality to exist.,797.363,2.135
The Press: The President tweeted earlier today.,799.498,2.503
"He described this bill as, &amp;quot;Our wonderful new",802.001,3.136
healthcare bill.&amp;quot; There&amp;#39;s been a little,805.137,1.702
bit of confusion.,806.839,0.667
Does this represent the administration&amp;#39;s bill and,807.506,3.003
is there anything in this bill that the,810.509,1.769
administration cannot support?,812.278,1.301
Secretary Price: This has been a work in progress.,813.579,2.035
"As you know, this has been going on for over a year.",815.614,3.003
The work that I had the privilege of participating,818.617,3.003
in when I served in the House of Representatives,821.62,2.97
in the last Congress was open and transparent and,824.59,4.204
we invited folks in to give their ideas.,828.794,4.605
"And tens, if not hundreds, of people had input",833.399,2.936
into that process.,836.335,1.435
"This grew out of that, and over the past number of",837.77,2.335
"weeks, we&amp;#39;ve been having conversations with folks",840.105,2.436
"on the Hill, in the House, and in the Senate, and",842.541,3.604
other stakeholders.,846.145,0.734
And so this is a work product that is a result,846.879,2.402
of all of that process.,849.281,2.836
The President and the administration support,852.117,2.503
this step in the right -- what we believe is in the,854.62,2.069
"right direction, a step that repeals Obamacare and",856.689,3.036
gets us moving in the direction of those,859.725,1.735
principles that I outlined.,861.46,1.769
The Press: Do you support everything that&amp;#39;s in that,863.229,1.267
"bill that&amp;#39;s sitting on the table, sir?",864.496,1.602
Do you support everything that&amp;#39;s in the bill sitting,866.098,1.301
"on the table, sir?",867.399,1.468
Secretary Price: This is a work in progress and we&amp;#39;ll,868.867,1.502
work with the House and the Senate in,870.369,2.135
this process.,872.504,0.534
"As you know, it&amp;#39;s a legislative process",873.038,1.402
that occurs.,874.44,1.001
I&amp;#39;m glad you pointed out the bill is on the,875.441,2.135
table there.,877.576,0.467
"As you&amp;#39;ll see, this bill right here was the bill",878.644,2.569
that was introduced in 2009 and 2010 by the,881.213,3.437
previous administration.,884.65,1.368
Notice how thick that is.,886.018,1.134
Some of you will recall that I actually turned the,887.152,1.936
pages and went through that piece of legislation,889.088,2.569
in a YouTube.,891.657,0.901
The pile on the right is the current bill.,892.558,1.735
And what it means is that we are making certain that,894.293,2.369
"the process, that the decisions that are going",896.662,2.269
to be made are not going to be made by the,898.931,4.805
federal government.,903.736,1.034
They&amp;#39;re going to be made by patients and families,904.77,1.935
and doctors.,906.705,1.101
One last --,907.806,0.668
"The Press: Mr. Secretary, given the opposition that",908.474,1.368
"John and others have brought up here today,",909.842,1.334
does this plan already need to be salvaged,911.176,2.57
in your view?,913.746,0.667
And how do you do it?,914.413,1.501
"Secretary Price: Oh, no.",915.914,1.102
You know what happens with these things.,917.016,1.801
"You start at a starting point, people engage and",918.817,4.438
"they get involved in the process, sometimes to a",923.255,2.503
greater degree.,925.758,0.667
Nothing focuses the mind like a bill that&amp;#39;s,926.425,2.269
currently on the table and that has a -- as a work in,928.694,3.337
progress -- or in process.,932.031,1.835
And we&amp;#39;ll work through it.,933.866,1.768
This --,935.634,0.668
"The Press: So, this is a starting point here?",936.302,1.368
Secretary Price: This is an important process,937.67,1.801
to be had.,939.471,1.001
The American people have said to their elected,940.472,2.536
leaders that the Obamacare process for them gaining,943.008,1.335
coverage and care is not working.,944.343,1.335
That&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;ve said.,945.678,0.667
"And so, we believe it&amp;#39;s important to respond to",946.345,1.368
the American people and provide a healthcare,947.713,1.335
system that allows for them to purchase the kind,949.048,1.334
of coverage and care that they desire. Yes?,950.382,1.335
The Press: You said in your letter to the House,951.717,4.438
chairman that necessary technical and appropriate,956.155,5.338
changes might need to be made for this bill to,961.493,4.004
reach the President&amp;#39;s desk.,965.497,1.969
"So, what specific changes is the White House and the",967.466,4.938
administration looking for in this bill?,972.404,2.937
"Secretary Price: Well, as I mentioned, there are",975.341,1.935
three different phases to this process.,977.276,1.701
"One is this bill, this legislation that&amp;#39;s working",978.977,2.57
"through under the rules of reconciliation, which is a",981.547,2.836
fancy term to mean that it -- there are only certain,984.383,2.536
things that you can do from a budgetary,986.919,2.035
standpoint has to affect,988.954,1.235
either spending or revenue.,990.189,2.402
"There are things that you can&amp;#39;t do in this bill, and",992.591,1.902
those we plan on doing across the horizon in,994.493,3.57
"phase two, which is the regulatory portion, and",998.063,2.87
"then in phase three, which is another piece of",1000.933,1.802
legislation that would be going through the House,1002.735,2.969
and the Senate with a majority -- supermajority,1005.704,3.904
in the Senate.,1009.608,0.734
That process will incorporate all of the,1010.342,3.17
kinds of things that we believe are absolutely,1013.512,1.902
necessary to reconstitute that individual and,1015.414,2.569
"small-group market and to get us in a position,",1017.983,2.102
"again, where patients and families and docs are",1020.085,2.069
making these decisions.,1022.154,0.734
"The Press: Mr. Secretary, bearing in mind that the",1022.888,1.935
"CBO score isn&amp;#39;t done yet, can you guarantee that",1024.823,3.07
this plan will not have a markedly negative impact,1027.893,3.57
on deficit or result in millions of Americans,1031.463,2.102
losing health insurance?,1033.565,0.768
Secretary Price: What I can say is that the goal,1034.333,2.102
and the desire I know of the individuals on the,1036.435,2.169
Hill is to make certain that this does not,1038.604,1.835
increase the cost to the federal government.,1040.439,1.835
"The Press: Mr. Secretary, two elements of the bill.",1042.274,3.737
I have questions about how they control costs and how,1046.011,4.171
they help with access.,1050.182,1.668
The Medicaid per-capita block grant through the,1051.85,2.937
"states, how is that sort of fundamentally different",1054.787,3.336
from the Obamacare regime on Medicaid in terms of,1058.123,3.737
expanding access?,1061.86,0.834
"And then the second point, why doesn&amp;#39;t this bill do",1062.694,4.205
away with the cost-sharing community ratings regime,1066.899,2.903
that Obamacare had?,1069.802,1.267
"Secretary Price: To the per-capita cap, Medicaid,",1071.069,3.003
"again, is a system that doesn&amp;#39;t work for patients.",1074.072,3.404
"You&amp;#39;ve got folks out there who need care, who need to",1077.476,2.502
see particular physicians,1079.978,1.335
who aren&amp;#39;t able to see them.,1081.313,2.369
All Americans should be saddened by the situation,1083.682,3.937
that we have when there are patients out there,1087.619,2.236
that can&amp;#39;t get the care that they need.,1089.855,2.336
We believe one of the keys to providing appropriate,1092.191,2.736
care in the Medicaid population is allowing the,1094.927,2.802
states to have the flexibility to address,1097.729,2.269
that Medicaid population.,1099.998,1.202
"Remember, Medicaid population is four",1101.2,1.968
different demographic groups.,1103.168,2.703
"It&amp;#39;s those who are disabled, it&amp;#39;s those who",1105.871,1.969
"are seniors, it&amp;#39;s healthy moms and kids,",1107.84,2.435
by and large.,1110.275,0.734
Those are the four main demographic groups.,1111.009,1.535
"And we, the federal government, force states,",1112.544,3.17
"mostly, to take care of those individuals in",1115.714,2.736
exactly the same way.,1118.45,1.235
If you describe that to the folks back home on,1119.685,2.969
"Main Street, they say, &amp;quot;That doesn&amp;#39;t make",1122.654,1.335
any sense at all.&amp;quot;,1123.989,1.101
You need a program that&amp;#39;s different for the healthy,1125.09,2.369
"moms and kids to respond to their needs, that&amp;#39;s",1127.459,2.636
different than folks who are disabled and seniors.,1130.095,3.47
"And so, what we believe is appropriate is to say to",1133.565,2.169
"the states, &amp;quot;You know your population best.",1135.734,2.436
You know best how to care for your,1138.17,1.868
vulnerable population.,1140.038,1.802
We&amp;#39;re going to watch you and make certain that you,1141.84,1.535
"do so, but you know how to do that.&amp;quot;",1143.375,1.702
And that will decrease costs markedly in the,1145.077,3.036
Medicaid program.,1148.113,0.801
We&amp;#39;re wasting significant amounts of money -- not,1148.914,2.235
that folks are getting too much care.,1151.149,2.136
We&amp;#39;re wasting it because it&amp;#39;s inefficient and,1153.285,1.635
there&amp;#39;s significant abuse in the system.,1154.92,2.636
"So, in terms of the cost-sharing, I think that",1157.556,3.036
the cost-sharing measures are being addressed.,1160.592,2.002
It&amp;#39;s important that we run through that process.,1162.594,2.703
This is the process where we felt the previous,1165.297,2.769
administration was spending money that they,1168.066,1.869
"didn&amp;#39;t have the authority to spend, and Congress is",1169.935,2.869
working through that to make certain that the,1172.804,2.503
rightful holders of the authority to spend money,1175.307,2.836
"in this nation, which is the Congress of the United",1178.143,2.336
"States, exercises that authority.",1180.479,2.903
"The Press: Mr. Secretary, how does the White House",1183.382,1.735
and you feel about the label &amp;quot;Trumpcare&amp;quot;?,1185.117,3.403
"Secretary Price: Oh, I&amp;#39;ll let others provide a",1188.52,1.802
description for it.,1190.322,0.834
I prefer to call it patient care.,1191.156,1.101
This is about patients at the end of the day.,1192.257,2.336
This isn&amp;#39;t about politicians.,1194.593,1.368
This isn&amp;#39;t about insurance companies.,1195.961,1.401
This is about patients.,1197.362,1.602
"And patients in this nation, especially those",1198.964,2.369
in the individual and small-group market.,1201.333,1.668
These are the folks.,1203.001,0.901
I had the privilege of going to Cincinnati last,1203.902,2.102
week with the Vice President to a,1206.004,1.869
small-business roundtable.,1207.873,2.069
"And one of the business owners, one of the",1209.942,2.035
"small-business owners there, said he had 18",1211.977,2.636
employees last year at this time.,1214.613,2.602
"This year, he has 15 employees -- not because",1217.215,2.47
"he doesn&amp;#39;t have the work, but because of the cost of",1219.685,2.002
health coverage for those individuals forced him to,1221.687,2.335
let three people go.,1224.022,0.668
"Now, they&amp;#39;re being forced to let three people go",1224.69,1.935
because the federal government has put in,1226.625,3.17
place rules and regulations that make it,1229.795,3.17
virtually impossible for folks in the individual,1232.965,2.302
and small-group market to provide coverage,1235.267,2.169
for their employees.,1237.436,1.301
This is a system that&amp;#39;s not working for people.,1238.737,2.502
"So, if we focus on the patients --",1241.239,2.403
I&amp;#39;ll call it patient care.,1243.642,1.001
"If you focus on the patients, we&amp;#39;ll get",1244.643,1.468
to the right answer.,1246.111,0.801
"The Press: Mr. Secretary, a major complaint -- sorry",1246.912,4.071
-- a major complaint of conservatives with phase,1250.983,2.836
one of the Obamacare repeal-and-replace is that,1253.819,2.402
it is missing a measure that would allow,1256.221,2.302
healthcare to be sold across state lines.,1258.523,2.203
"Now, the President said this morning that that",1260.726,2.535
would be in either phase two or phase three.,1263.261,2.837
Is that something that you believe the President,1266.098,2.536
"could do through executive action, and then you",1268.634,2.502
yourself could do?,1271.136,0.968
Or is that something that you believe has to be,1272.104,3.169
addressed legislatively?,1275.273,0.668
Secretary Price: There are different aspects to the,1275.941,2.469
purchase across state lines that will allow,1278.41,2.202
"individuals to gain, again, the kind of",1280.612,1.935
choices that they want.,1282.547,0.968
Some of this might be able to be done from a,1283.515,3.303
regulatory or a rules standpoint.,1286.818,1.502
"Some of it will require legislation, and that&amp;#39;s",1288.32,2.402
where we&amp;#39;re going to need the assistance of our,1290.722,2.703
friends on the other side of the aisle.,1293.425,2.502
The American people have demanded that they be able,1295.927,2.57
"to purchase coverage across state lines,",1298.497,2.169
purchase coverage that they want for themselves.,1300.666,2.202
"So whether it&amp;#39;s through association health plans,",1302.868,1.868
which allows individuals who are in small-business,1304.736,2.536
"groups, like the fellow that I just mentioned, to",1307.272,2.302
pool together nationally to be able to purchase,1309.574,2.169
"coverage, or whether it&amp;#39;s mom and dad, who don&amp;#39;t",1311.743,3.404
gain coverage through their employer through,1315.147,3.336
something called individual health pools,1318.483,1.635
that allows folks to pool together solely for the,1320.118,2.77
"purpose of purchasing coverage, even though",1322.888,1.935
they&amp;#39;re not otherwise economically aligned.,1324.823,2.703
That allows people -- there are 18 million folks,1327.526,2.869
in that individual and small-group market.,1330.395,1.869
That would allow those individuals to be able to,1332.264,2.102
purchase coverage and get the purchasing,1334.366,1.568
power of millions.,1335.934,0.901
That&amp;#39;s huge power and authority that we want to,1336.835,2.97
"put in the hands of people, that we want to",1339.805,1.534
put in the hands of patients.,1341.339,1.669
"And some of that may, in fact, require legislation.",1343.008,2.269
"Yes, sir?",1345.277,0.667
"The Press: Mr. Secretary, thank you.",1345.944,2.269
"Two questions but first, Congressman John Faso of",1348.213,4.471
New York has said that the issue of denying federal,1352.684,4.138
funds to Planned Parenthood should be,1356.822,2.202
separate from whatever healthcare bill finally,1359.024,3.37
emerges from Congress and is signed into,1362.394,2.836
law by the President.,1365.23,1.001
Is that the administration&amp;#39;s,1366.231,1.802
position as well?,1368.033,1.368
And my second question is this.,1369.401,1.835
You mentioned earlier the people who had their,1371.236,2.903
healthcare plans cancelled when they thought they,1374.139,2.502
could keep it.,1376.641,0.968
"I believe in your state of Georgia, more than a",1377.609,2.703
million people had that experience.,1380.312,1.968
Will some of the plans that were cancelled be,1382.28,2.703
able to come back under the new healthcare plan?,1384.983,3.103
"Secretary Price: Yeah, in terms of Planned",1388.086,2.302
"Parenthood, we think it&amp;#39;s important that the",1390.388,2.37
legislature work its will on this process.,1392.758,3.169
It&amp;#39;s incredibly important that we not violate,1395.927,2.77
anybody&amp;#39;s conscience.,1398.697,1.835
We want to protect the,1400.532,0.901
conscience provisions that exist.,1401.433,2.302
It&amp;#39;s also important to appreciate that through,1403.735,1.668
"community health centers, the bill that&amp;#39;s being",1405.403,1.769
proposed right now would allow greater access for,1407.172,2.836
women to healthcare in greater numbers of,1410.008,2.102
facilities across this land.,1412.11,2.603
And they&amp;#39;ve actually proposed more money for,1414.713,2.569
women&amp;#39;s healthcare than currently exists.,1417.282,2.236
"So, I think that they&amp;#39;re working their best to",1419.518,2.068
address that issue.,1421.586,1.602
In terms of whether or not old plans that were,1423.188,2.736
"available before might be available, absolutely.",1425.924,3.237
And we believe that the opportunity to provide a,1429.161,4.904
robust market -- robust choices for individuals,1434.065,4.538
across this land will be secured.,1438.603,1.969
"And, again, that&amp;#39;s one of the keys to bringing down",1440.572,2.035
"the premium costs, of bringing down the cost for",1442.607,2.002
health coverage.,1444.609,0.668
"So, we&amp;#39;re excited about that and look forward to",1445.277,2.302
that coming to pass.,1447.579,1.501
The Press: If the new plan calls for repealing the,1449.08,3.637
revenue-generating taxes and penalties but keeping,1452.717,2.47
"the entitlements, how is that sustainable?",1455.187,2.068
Secretary Price: That&amp;#39;s the work that somebody,1457.255,2.436
"mentioned over here, the Congressional Budget",1459.691,2.102
"Office score, and once the Congress receives that",1461.793,2.77
"score, then they&amp;#39;ll be working through that to",1464.563,2.769
make certain that in fact it is,1467.332,2.436
fiscally responsible.,1469.768,0.867
"Imagine, if you would, however, a system where",1470.635,3.437
the incentives within the system are all to drive,1474.072,3.303
"down costs, to provide greater choices and",1477.375,2.002
"competition for folks, and respond to the specific",1479.377,2.837
needs of patients.,1482.214,1.401
"And in so doing, what you do is actually get a much",1483.615,2.269
more efficient system for the provision and the,1485.884,2.636
delivery of healthcare.,1488.52,1.668
It&amp;#39;s a system we don&amp;#39;t have right now because the,1490.188,2.236
previous administration felt that the government,1492.424,2.002
-- the federal government ought to do all of this.,1494.426,2.169
And we&amp;#39;ve seen what came about when the federal,1496.595,2.469
government does all of that.,1499.064,1.601
"That is, increasing premiums, increasing",1500.665,1.902
"deductibles, decreasing choices.",1502.567,2.736
"You&amp;#39;ve got a card that says you&amp;#39;ve got insurance,",1505.303,1.869
"and you walk in, and you can&amp;#39;t afford what it is",1507.172,2.002
that&amp;#39;s trying to -- for the doctor that&amp;#39;s trying,1509.174,1.702
to take care of you.,1510.876,2.102
"So, this is not a system that&amp;#39;s working for folks",1512.978,2.802
in that individual and small-group market,1515.78,1.836
and in the exchanges.,1517.616,0.867
"The Press: Mr. Secretary, many have complained that",1518.483,2.336
Obamacare resulted in higher wait times,1520.819,2.235
in the emergency room.,1523.054,1.468
Will this new bill cause that?,1524.522,1.302
Have you had any idea on that?,1525.824,1.435
Secretary Price: One of the things that the,1527.259,1.668
previous administration said was that they were,1528.927,2.836
going to be able to drive folks away from one of the,1531.763,2.836
most expensive areas for the provision of,1534.599,2.202
"healthcare, and that is the emergency rooms.",1536.801,2.036
"In fact, they did just the opposite.",1538.837,2.102
"And much of that is because of, again, the",1540.939,2.202
rules and the regulations that they put in place.,1543.141,2.269
"So, from our perspective, we believe that if",1545.41,3.003
individuals are able to purchase the kind of,1548.413,2.035
"coverage that they want, then they&amp;#39;ll have access",1550.448,2.436
to the kind of doctors and other providers that they,1552.884,2.669
"desire, and won&amp;#39;t need to be able to be seen",1555.553,2.403
in the emergency room.,1557.956,0.767
They&amp;#39;ll already have the care.,1558.723,2.336
"Emergency rooms ought to be for emergencies, not",1561.059,2.836
for the standard care that individuals tend to,1563.895,2.436
receive right now.,1566.331,0.801
"So, we believe that if you put in place the right",1567.132,2.369
"system, then emergency rooms and emergency",1569.501,2.502
physicians will be able to have the opportunity to,1572.003,2.036
care for those individuals that appropriately present,1574.039,2.836
to their department.,1576.875,0.667
"The Press: Mr. Secretary, I&amp;#39;m interested in",1577.542,1.735
following up on your comment that it&amp;#39;s,1579.277,1.835
important that no one vote on anything that,1581.112,3.003
violates their conscience.,1584.115,1.168
Federal funding already can&amp;#39;t be used for,1585.283,2.636
"abortions, but are you saying that the",1587.919,2.669
administration has a position on provision of,1590.588,2.636
birth control at these community health centers?,1593.224,2.67
"And secondly, is the administration looking to",1595.894,2.636
actively withhold funding to Planned Parenthood if,1598.53,2.669
"they continue to provide abortions,",1601.199,1.902
as has been reported?,1603.101,1.501
Secretary Price: We&amp;#39;re working through,1604.602,1.936
all of those issues.,1606.538,0.867
"As you know, many of those were through the",1607.405,1.602
rule-making process and,1609.007,1.668
we&amp;#39;re working through that.,1610.675,0.868
So that&amp;#39;s not a part of this piece of,1611.543,1.535
legislation right here.,1613.078,1.701
The Press: But you don&amp;#39;t have a view on provision,1614.779,1.335
of birth control and access to it?,1616.114,1.468
"When you&amp;#39;re talking about women&amp;#39;s healthcare, which",1617.582,1.368
"you brought up, and saying you wanted to expand",1618.95,2.102
more community funding.,1621.052,0.701
"Secretary Price: Yeah, what we&amp;#39;re doing, as I",1621.753,1.902
"say, is working through the rules and the",1623.655,1.335
regulations to see where the previous,1624.99,1.701
"administration was, see how they did it, and",1626.691,1.835
whether or not it needs to be addressed.,1628.526,1.602
With the understanding that what we believe is,1630.128,1.869
important when we look at the rules and regulations,1631.997,2.369
is to define whether or not that rule or,1634.366,2.002
regulation actually helps patients or -- and,1636.368,3.837
"decreases costs, or harms patients and",1640.205,2.302
increases costs.,1642.507,1.068
"If it does the latter, then we need",1643.575,1.568
to do away it.,1645.143,0.701
"If it does the former, then we ought",1645.844,1.334
to accentuate it.,1647.178,0.701
The Press: What was the issue of conscience you,1647.879,1.935
were talking about?,1649.814,0.668
What was the issue of conscience you were,1650.482,1.668
talking about then?,1652.15,0.667
Secretary Price: To make certain that individuals,1652.817,1.769
in the market are not forced to do things that,1654.586,3.77
violate their conscience.,1658.356,1.201
"Yes, sir?",1659.557,0.668
"The Press: Mr. Secretary, thank you, sir.",1660.225,1.701
Common people and the small businesses have been,1661.926,2.57
waiting for this new bill under President Trump.,1664.496,3.47
"So, any message, sir, for them?",1667.966,1.902
"Secretary Price: Well, I think that this is the",1669.868,3.17
culmination of years of work.,1673.038,2.335
It&amp;#39;s the culmination of years of concern and,1675.373,4.138
frustration by the American people.,1679.511,2.669
They knew at the time that the previous bill -- the,1682.18,2.536
previous law passed that it wasn&amp;#39;t going,1684.716,2.269
to help them.,1686.985,0.801
They knew that costs were going to go up.,1687.786,3.436
"In fact, we predicted at the time that costs would",1691.222,2.97
go up and that access would go down.,1694.192,2.536
"And so, this is the culmination of years of",1696.728,2.836
"hard work by the electorate, by the",1699.564,2.669
citizens of this country to say that we want a,1702.233,2.57
"system, again, that respects patients and",1704.803,1.735
families and doctors in these decisions.,1706.538,1.468
One more.,1708.006,3.003
"The Press: Thank you, Mr. Secretary.",1711.009,0.834
The President tweeted out earlier today that he,1711.843,1.668
believes that he&amp;#39;s working on a plan to have drug,1713.511,13.48
prices come down by spurring competition.,1717.582,2.503
Can you tell us a little bit about what that plan,1720.085,1.935
"is going to be, when it might be rolled out?",1722.42,1.301
Is it part of these phases?,1724.155,1.502
"And then the second question, the bill also",1725.657,2.169
includes a tax break for insurance executives that,1727.826,3.036
"make more than $500,000.",1731.83,2.102
You said this is about patients.,1733.932,1.201
Why is that tax break important for,1735.667,1.468
this legislation?,1737.569,0.634
"Secretary Price: To the latter, I&amp;#39;m not",1738.203,1.201
aware of that.,1739.404,0.701
I&amp;#39;ll look into that.,1740.105,1.267
Drug pricing is really important.,1741.372,2.47
So many individuals are now having significant,1743.842,3.236
difficulty being able to afford the medications,1747.078,1.902
that they&amp;#39;ve been prescribed.,1748.98,2.536
"So, we -- whether it&amp;#39;s -- and it&amp;#39;s not able to be",1751.516,5.005
addressed specifically in this phase one because,1759.691,1.835
it&amp;#39;s not a revenue or spending issue for the,1761.526,0.634
federal government.,1762.16,0.734
"So, it can&amp;#39;t be in this phase one.",1762.894,2.035
"But in phase two and three, which may be",1764.929,2.002
"concurrent along with this phase one, but in phase",1766.931,3.604
"two and three, then we look forward to bringing",1770.535,2.202
"solutions, to solve the remarkable challenge that",1772.737,3.937
patients have across this line with the increase in,1776.674,2.403
pricing of drugs.,1779.077,1.201
I&amp;#39;ve got to run.,1780.278,0.901
You&amp;#39;ve got a guy right here who is going to,1781.179,0.901
answer all the rest of the questions.,1782.48,0.868
Thank you so much.,1783.681,0.701
"God, bless you.",1784.382,3.537
"Mr. Spicer: Thank you, Dr. Price.",1787.919,2.336
Let me just kind of continue on.,1790.255,2.969
"The bottom line, I think, that the Secretary was",1793.224,1.835
making is that Obamacare sought to cover 20 million,1795.46,3.57
"people and in the process, it drove up costs for",1799.497,1.268
"everybody, whether or not you were in the",1801.199,1.702
exchange or not.,1802.901,1.368
Most people get their insurance through their,1804.269,0.834
"employers, older populations get their",1805.603,1.535
"healthcare through Medicare, low-income",1807.605,1.902
populations get their healthcare through,1810.041,0.901
"Medicaid, and veterans get their insurance",1811.376,1.802
through Tri-Care.,1814.045,0.601
"So, what we&amp;#39;re talking about here is a very",1815.213,1.034
defined amount of individuals that we&amp;#39;re,1816.648,1.167
"trying to address, and not affect the entire system.",1818.75,2.068
Obamacare turned our healthcare system on its,1821.819,2.57
head to address the pool of individuals who don&amp;#39;t,1824.389,1.168
fall into any of the buckets that I mentioned.,1825.557,2.268
Our plan that we&amp;#39;re talking about today with,1827.825,2.036
the House will ensure that those individuals will,1829.861,2.169
"receive the care that they need, if they want an",1832.03,2.335
"affordable cost, while",1834.365,1.502
not sending rates skyrocketing.,1835.867,1.501
Obamacare was an over-complicated bill that,1837.368,2.269
served the special interests and not the,1839.637,1.268
American people.,1840.905,1.368
These over 974 pages that were passed -- and then we,1842.273,3.737
"were told we had to read them, are filled with",1846.01,2.436
carve-outs by over $1 billion of,1848.446,1.735
healthcare-related lobbying that was spent on,1850.181,2.669
the year that Obamacare was crafted.,1852.85,2.236
"Our plan, in far fewer pages -- 123, much",1855.086,3.504
"smaller, much bigger -- so far, we&amp;#39;re at 57 for the",1858.59,6.172
repeal plan and 66 pages,1864.762,1.936
for the replacement portion.,1866.698,1.735
We&amp;#39;ll undo this.,1868.433,0.867
"And remember, half of it, 57 of those pages, are",1869.3,3.003
the repeal part.,1872.303,1.835
"So, when you really get down to it, our plan is 66",1874.138,1.368
"pages long, half of what we actually",1876.207,2.036
even have there.,1878.61,1.167
We&amp;#39;ll undo the massive disaster and replace it,1879.777,1.802
with a plan to return healthcare back,1882.347,1.701
to the patient.,1884.449,1.001
"As the President outlined in his joint address, he",1885.45,2.335
expects five core principles to guide,1887.785,2.269
Congress through this healthcare process.,1890.054,1.969
"First, ensure that the American people with",1892.023,2.736
pre-existing conditions have access to coverage.,1894.759,2.402
"Second, ensure a stable transition for Americans",1897.161,2.002
currently enrolled in the exchanges.,1899.163,2.403
"Third, provide more equitable tax treatment",1901.566,3.737
through tax credits for people who already don&amp;#39;t,1905.303,2.536
receive tax advantage healthcare from their,1907.839,1.768
employer -- and I know that&amp;#39;s something that,1909.607,1.335
Secretary Price was talking about.,1910.942,2.169
For the vast number of people who get their,1913.111,1.468
"insurance through their employer, they&amp;#39;re",1915.146,2.703
getting it tax free.,1918.483,0.934
"They&amp;#39;re not taxed on that benefit, which is",1920.118,1.635
something that is not afforded to people who are,1922.687,1.868
in the individual market who either run a small,1924.555,2.069
business or are sole proprietors.,1927.258,2.202
"Fourth, we should expand the power of Health",1929.46,2.403
Savings Accounts to return control to Americans over,1932.797,1.068
their healthcare dollar and decisions.,1934.299,2.869
"They should be able to choose the plan they want,",1937.168,1.335
not the plan that&amp;#39;s forced on them by government.,1938.936,1.969
"And finally, we should give our state governors",1941.539,1.702
the resources and flexibility they need with,1943.741,2.036
Medicare to make sure that no one is left out.,1946.177,2.603
This is the Obamacare replacement plan that,1948.78,1.868
"everyone has been asking for, the plan that the",1951.049,1.735
"President ran on, and the plan that will ultimately",1953.251,2.335
save the system.,1955.92,1.368
It&amp;#39;s also a culmination of years of dedicated work,1957.288,1.835
and careful thought by Republicans to find a,1959.59,2.203
replacement that will best undo the damage that&amp;#39;s,1962.16,2.169
"been caused by Obamacare, while ensuring that all",1964.796,2.168
Americans have peace of mind during this stable,1967.365,2.202
transition period.,1970.034,1.535
These are the principles for which conservatives,1971.569,1.435
"have been fighting for, for years.",1973.338,1.701
President Trump looks forward to continuing the,1975.039,1.702
dialogue between the administration and the,1976.741,2.002
Hill on saving the healthcare system.,1978.743,2.069
What&amp;#39;s important to remember is that we&amp;#39;re not,1980.812,1.468
going to be able to do all of this in one bill.,1982.28,2.069
"As the Secretary mentioned, there are two",1984.349,1.835
other steps as well that allow us to get more of,1986.184,2.302
the President&amp;#39;s plan accomplished after we pass,1988.486,1.535
"this first, important, major step.",1990.421,2.836
"The second piece is already underway, and",1993.257,1.502
that&amp;#39;s what Secretary Price can do through,1995.126,0.934
executive action.,1996.427,1.068
He has already rolled out a handful of important,1997.495,1.902
"actions, including the major marketplace",1999.831,2.702
"stabilization regulation, to help bring stability to",2002.533,3.571
the collapsing insurance market.,2006.604,1.401
He&amp;#39;ll continue to enact a number of policy changes,2008.005,2.303
in the regulatory and administration space --,2010.808,2.036
administrative space -- to achieve what the first,2013.344,1.935
step cannot because of the nature of reconciliation.,2017.648,1.569
The third piece of executing the President&amp;#39;s,2019.217,2.469
healthcare plan is on -- requires 60 votes in,2021.686,2.502
legislation.,2024.188,1.735
"Maybe, maybe more, depending on what we can",2025.923,1.769
do and when.,2027.692,1.501
That&amp;#39;s how we&amp;#39;ll move forward on the policies of,2029.193,1.402
"purchasing across state lines, lowing drug prices",2030.595,3.403
that just came up -- and repealing any of,2033.998,2.102
Obamacare&amp;#39;s premium spiking insurance market,2036.1,2.303
distortions that can&amp;#39;t be done through this,2038.403,2.302
current bill.,2040.705,1.635
"Also, yesterday, in addition to speaking with",2042.34,2.469
"Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, the President",2044.809,1.501
also had separate calls with the Prime Minister of,2046.31,2.703
"Japan, Abe, and South Korea&amp;#39;s acting President, Hwang.",2049.013,4.805
"During both of these calls, the President",2053.818,1.868
reiterated the United States&amp;#39; ironclad,2055.686,2.303
commitment to stand with Japan and South Korea in,2057.989,2.702
the face of the serious threat posed by,2060.691,2.369
North Korea.,2063.06,1.302
He also emphasizes the administration is taking,2064.362,2.169
steps to further enhance our ability to deter and,2066.531,2.969
defend against North Korea&amp;#39;s ballistic,2069.5,2.97
"missiles, using a full range of the United",2072.47,2.235
States&amp;#39; military capabilities.,2074.705,2.269
"Moving on to today&amp;#39;s schedule, this morning the",2076.974,2.436
President had a call with President,2079.811,0.967
Kenyatta of Kenya.,2081.279,1.735
"He&amp;#39;ll have a readout for that call soon, if it&amp;#39;s",2083.014,1.501
not already out.,2084.515,1.168
The President and the First Lady also announced,2085.683,1.835
the official reopening of public tours here at the,2087.518,2.469
White House.,2089.987,0.935
You may have seen the President stop by to,2090.922,2.302
surprise -- greet some of the first visitors,2093.224,2.603
on their tour.,2095.827,1.701
We&amp;#39;re looking forward to welcoming the people back,2097.528,1.902
to -- the American people back to what is,2099.43,1.468
"affectionately referred to as, &amp;quot;The People&amp;#39;s House.&amp;quot;",2101.732,2.503
We are the world&amp;#39;s only executive residence and,2104.235,2.202
office of head of state that also serves as a,2106.437,2.136
museum free to the people.,2109.006,2.736
Visiting the White House is obviously an experience,2111.742,1.535
"to -- uniquely American, and we encourage guests of",2113.277,2.169
all ages to come visit the White House --,2116.013,1.001

"combined penalties between the Commerce Department,",2149.947,1.969

ever levied by the U.S.,2158.389,1.468
government in such a case.,2160.224,1.035

The gather time is 3:20.,2214.579,1.701
"The President will also meet with Richard Trumka,",2216.28,2.136
the president of the AFL-CIO.,2218.749,2.603
They&amp;#39;re expected to discuss the importance of,2221.352,1.001
investing in our country&amp;#39;s infrastructure and,2222.887,2.402
"renegotiating trade agreements, like NAFTA.",2225.289,3.304

"meeting, and we&amp;#39;ll have further details on it.",2230.194,2.136
"This evening, the President will visit with",2233.264,1.068

Jonathan Karl.,2262.86,0.868
"The Press: Sean, it&amp;#39;s been a --",2263.728,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Jonathan?,2265.229,0.934
The Press: -- full -- thank you.,2266.163,0.968
(Laughter).,2267.498,2.035
"Sean, it&amp;#39;s been a full --",2269.533,0.768
Mr. Spicer: You&amp;#39;re out of practice.,2270.301,1.301
The Press: (Laughs) I know.,2271.602,0.567
It&amp;#39;s been a full three days since the President,2272.169,1.902
"said that President Obama had his wires tapped, his",2275.172,3.304
phones tapped at Trump Tower.,2278.476,2.402
"In those three days, has the White House come up",2280.878,1.702
with any evidence whatsoever to prove,2282.58,1.802
that allegation?,2284.382,0.967
Mr. Spicer: Yeah.,2285.349,0.601
I addressed this multiple times yesterday.,2285.95,2.202
I think the President -- we put out a statement on,2288.152,1.635
Sunday saying that we would have no further,2289.787,2.336
"comment, and we were asking the House and the",2292.123,1.568
Senate Intelligence Committees to look into,2293.691,2.169
"this concern, and report back.",2295.86,2.803
The Press: Can&amp;#39;t the President just ask the FBI,2298.663,1.935
"director, &amp;quot;Did it happen?&amp;quot;",2300.598,1.168
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think I -- I -- look, I think --",2301.766,1.001
The Press: Has he asked him?,2303.2,1.035
Mr. Spicer: No.,2304.235,0.267
The President has not.,2304.502,0.567
"And I think that, you know, we&amp;#39;ve gone back and",2305.069,2.202
"forth with you guys, when I think there is clearly a",2307.271,1.902
role that Congress can play in its,2309.173,1.368
oversight capabilities.,2310.541,1.635
"They made it very clear that they have the staff,",2312.176,1.869
"the resources, and the process.",2314.045,1.334
I think that&amp;#39;s the appropriate place for this,2315.379,1.802
to handle.,2317.181,1.268
"I think, if we were to start to get involved, you",2318.449,1.802
would then write stories about how we&amp;#39;re,2320.251,0.834
getting involved.,2321.085,1.034
"So, it&amp;#39;s a no-win situation.",2322.119,0.968
I think the smartest and most deliberative way to,2323.087,2.469
address the situation is ask the House and Senate,2325.556,2.069
"Intelligence Committees, who are already in the",2327.625,1.902
"process of looking into this, to look into this",2329.527,2.068
and other leaks of classified information,2331.595,2.069
that are troubling to our nation&amp;#39;s,2333.664,2.269
national security.,2335.933,1.735
"So, as the President said in the statement on",2337.668,2.436
"Sunday, we believe that that investigation, as",2340.104,3.604
well as the investigation of other classified leaks,2343.708,2.769
and other important information that threatens,2346.477,1.969
"our national security, be looked into by the House",2348.446,2.235
and Senate Intelligence Committees.,2350.681,2.002
And then we encourage them to report back.,2352.683,2.102
The Press: Okay.,2354.785,1.135
Can I just ask -- do you believe that President,2355.92,1.234
Obama ordered something like that?,2357.154,0.801
"Mr. Spicer: I -- you know, I get that that&amp;#39;s a",2357.955,1.034
cute question to ask.,2358.989,0.768
My job is to represent the President and to talk,2359.757,2.536
about what he&amp;#39;s doing and what he wants.,2362.293,2.135
"And he has made very clear what his goal is, what he",2364.428,4.738
would like to have happen.,2369.166,2.202
"And so, I just -- I&amp;#39;ll leave it at that.",2371.368,2.37
And I think we&amp;#39;ve tried to play this game before.,2373.738,1.267
I&amp;#39;m not here to speak for myself.,2375.005,1.836
I&amp;#39;m here to speak for the President of the United,2376.841,1.301
States and our government. Zeke --,2378.142,1.335
"The Press: Hi, Sean.",2379.477,0.767
Two questions for you.,2380.244,1.401
One following up on Secretary Price said,2381.645,1.168
earlier -- he was asked by John about whether the,2382.813,2.202
administration was willing to make a -- for the,2385.816,2.036
American people right now who like their doctor and,2388.252,2.436
"like their health insurance plan, is the",2391.088,1.669
"White House willing to make a commitment today,",2392.757,1.701
"that when this replacement bill is passed, if it",2394.458,5.005
"passes, that they will -- on the -- I mean, at the",2399.463,2.269
"end of that, be able to keep their doctor and keep",2401.732,1.335
their healthcare plan?,2403.067,1.601
"And secondly, just changing here radically",2404.668,2.603
onto a -- China issued overnight some strong,2407.271,3.337
rhetoric promising consequences for,2410.608,1.668
deployment of the bad missile system in,2412.276,1.301
South Korea.,2413.577,1.035
How do you respond to that?,2414.612,2.702
"Mr. Spicer: So, on the first piece, I think --",2417.314,1.502
"look, one of the things that&amp;#39;s important to",2420.284,1.735
"understand about this process, that&amp;#39;s very",2422.753,1.969
different from when the Democrats did it.,2425.189,0.634
You recall then Speaker Pelosi said you are going,2426.323,1.802
to have to read the bill to know what&amp;#39;s in it?,2428.459,2.703
I think there&amp;#39;s a big difference.,2431.162,0.567
This is the bill.,2432.296,0.968
"It&amp;#39;s right here, it&amp;#39;s on the website, we&amp;#39;re going",2433.264,2.469
through regular order.,2436.233,0.668
If you go the House of Representatives website --,2437.368,1.501
"Speaker Paul Ryan&amp;#39;s website, it&amp;#39;s listed.",2439.436,1.769
"Everybody can read it, and it&amp;#39;s going to go through",2441.739,1.668
what we call regular order.,2443.841,1.501
And we are not jamming this down,2445.843,0.701
anybody&amp;#39;s throat.,2446.944,0.601
It is going to go through a committee process; all,2447.545,2.335
"parties involved, all representatives in the",2449.88,2.036
"House, will be able to have input into it.",2451.916,1.067
"I think that&amp;#39;s the way to conduct this process, is",2453.818,5.238
to do it to allow people to watch the process,2459.056,1.335
"happen in the committees, allow members of Congress",2461.258,3.27
"to have their input into it, to make amendments, to",2464.862,3.103
see that we get the best bill that achieves the,2468.265,1.468
goal for the American people.,2470.034,1.334
"When it was done last time, it was jammed down",2471.368,1.368
"people&amp;#39;s throats, and look what happened.",2473.07,1.802
You had 974 pages that people struggled to read,2475.84,4.17
afterward and figure out what had just gotten,2480.477,1.001
"passed, and the consequences were,",2481.812,1.735
"frankly, devastating.",2483.547,1.268
"So, to your point about keeping your doctor, in a",2484.815,2.569
"lot of cases, you&amp;#39;ve lost your doctor for a",2487.384,2.536
couple reasons.,2489.92,0.701
"One, they may not participate in the plan,",2490.621,2.202
they may not take insurance at all anymore.,2492.823,2.269
"Two, they might not take Medicaid -- or, three,",2495.092,1.735
they might not take Medicaid.,2496.827,2.603
And the list goes on and on about why they might,2499.43,2.536
"not be there, or your plan, the plan that you",2501.966,1.501
"got, is no longer accessible.",2503.467,2.302
"As the Secretary mentioned, one-third of",2505.769,2.036
all counties in the United States no longer take,2507.805,3.37
"Medicaid, or -- excuse me -- have only one plan that",2511.175,2.869
you can choose from.,2514.044,1.035
"So, it&amp;#39;s a fact right now that you -- in most cases,",2515.079,3.904
you have no choice.,2518.983,1.434
You&amp;#39;ve lost that ability.,2520.417,1.836
Our goal is to actually add more choice and,2522.253,2.702
more competition.,2524.955,0.567
"Right now, the government tells you, &amp;quot;You must have",2526.523,2.103
"this plan or you will pay a penalty, and within this",2528.626,2.302
"plan, here&amp;#39;s what you have to have.&amp;quot;",2530.928,2.602
We&amp;#39;ve lost the element of choice and competition in,2533.53,2.103
"healthcare, and by brining all of that back I think",2535.633,3.27
there&amp;#39;s a higher degree of likelihood that you&amp;#39;re,2538.903,1.935
going to get the plan that you want and you&amp;#39;re going,2540.838,1.835
"to get the doctor you want, because it&amp;#39;s your",2542.673,1.335
choice and not the government&amp;#39;s choice.,2544.008,2.235
"And that&amp;#39;s a big, big difference.",2546.243,1.735
"This plan was jammed down everybody&amp;#39;s throat, and",2547.978,2.403
"the consequences took their plans away, it took",2551.315,2.269
"their doctors away, and it drove up costs.",2553.584,1.968
"This plan allows more competition, more people",2555.552,4.105
"to enter it, and the American people and",2559.657,1.968
patients to make a decision on what,2561.625,1.669
plan they want.,2563.294,1.501
"If they have a plan and a doctor that they like,",2564.795,1.635
then they&amp;#39;re going to choose a plan that allows,2566.43,0.968
them to continue with that doctor.,2567.898,0.734
But there&amp;#39;s going to be more competition and more,2569.4,1.635
"choice, not less, and that&amp;#39;s frankly",2571.368,1.702
what you have now.,2573.07,1.268
"With respect to China, I think I addressed this",2574.338,1.735
"yesterday, we stand shoulder-to-shoulder with",2576.073,2.836
Japan and South Korea in doing what we can to,2578.909,3.604
protect that region in particular from an attack,2582.513,2.903
from North Korea.,2585.916,0.968
We understand the situation; we continue to,2586.884,2.269
work with them.,2589.653,1.001
"As I mentioned, the President spoke to both",2590.654,0.634
leaders yesterday; we provided a read out of,2591.689,4.437
those calls.,2596.427,1.268
But we obviously understand the concerns,2597.695,1.534
"with China, but this is -- this is a national",2600.197,0.601
security issue for them. Hunter.,2601.432,1.034
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",2602.967,0.8
How concerned is the President with the,2604.368,1.702
situation between North Korea and,2606.07,2.569
Malaysia right now?,2608.639,1.201
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I would -- as I said, I think we",2609.84,2.369
were very well aware of the -- what&amp;#39;s going,2612.576,2.669
on in the region.,2615.546,0.567
"The President, obviously, had a conversation with,",2616.447,1.234
"in particular, the leader -- the acting president of",2618.115,1.935
South Korea last night and -- with respect to what&amp;#39;s,2620.417,2.436
going on there.,2623.12,1.735
"And again, I&amp;#39;ll refer that to the National Security",2624.855,1.468
Committee to give you further.,2626.657,1.134
Cheryl Boldin. Cheryl.,2627.791,1.969
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",2629.76,0.601
"Mr. Spicer: I know, I -- sorry, I forgot you",2630.361,1.601
yesterday.,2631.962,0.601
The Press: I appreciate it.,2632.563,1.701
"So, two big questions.",2634.264,1.702
"One, on Healthcare, if the CBO scores this bill and",2635.966,4.805
it does not provide the amount of coverage that,2640.771,2.202
"the Affordable Care Act did, will the President",2644.074,2.503
still support it?,2646.577,1.201
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I&amp;#39;m not going to get ahead of -- I",2647.778,2.636
"mean, like, I -- Secretary Price ventured this --",2650.414,1.602
let&amp;#39;s not get ahead of the CBO going through this.,2652.016,1.468
"But I think, as I mentioned to Zeke, one of",2653.484,2.569
the things that&amp;#39;s important to understand:,2656.053,1.401
There&amp;#39;s -- this is -- this bill has to be done in the,2657.454,2.636
phases that it has to address the repeal part of,2660.09,3.07
it and the replace part of it.,2663.16,1.401
There are only certain things that we can do,2664.561,1.902
through reconciliation.,2666.463,1.435
I know there&amp;#39;s the regulatory piece that we,2667.898,1.368
can do through action that the Secretary is empowered,2669.266,3.036
"to do, frankly, under Obamacare.",2672.302,2.67
And then third is an additional piece of,2674.972,2.235
legislation that addresses things.,2677.207,1.635
But there are cost-saving measures that -- in,2678.842,4.505
"competition aspects of this, that have to be",2683.347,4.337
included in phase two or three because they are not,2687.684,2.737
allowed in the reconciliation bill,2690.421,3.336
because of the nature of how reconciliation works,2693.757,3.337
on Capitol Hill.,2697.094,1.201
"So, I think that one of the things that we have to",2698.295,3.237
understand is that how that score comes out from,2701.532,1.601
the Correctional Budget Office will depend on what,2703.133,2.069
they -- whether they look at it specifically with,2705.202,2.703
just a phase one or whether they look at it in,2707.905,1.935
its totality.,2709.84,1.301
But I&amp;#39;m confident that if you look at what&amp;#39;s going,2711.141,3.137
"on right now, Cheryl, it&amp;#39;s unsustainable.",2714.278,2.536
"I mean, premiums in state after state, as Dr. Price",2716.814,2.736
"mentioned, they&amp;#39;re up 25% on average.",2719.55,2.269
"Arizona&amp;#39;s a 116%; I think, you know, Oklahoma&amp;#39;s in",2721.819,2.869
"the 50s; Minnesota&amp;#39;s in the 40s; I mean, this is",2724.688,2.569
unsustainable for a family to continue to pay the,2727.257,4.205
"premiums that they have, and for individuals, small",2731.462,1.801
"business owners, et cetera.",2733.263,1.502
"So, the question is, can we allow people to go on",2734.765,2.636
this trajectory where more and more of their paycheck,2737.401,2.703
"is getting eaten up in a plan that&amp;#39;s, frankly, not",2740.104,2.769
"giving them choice, doctors, or plans that",2742.873,3.003
they want?,2745.876,0.767
"This plan, I think, clearly achieves those",2746.643,2.536
goals a lot better.,2749.179,1.602
"It gets the price -- cost containment down, it gets",2750.781,2.602
"price control under, and it allows doctors and",2753.383,2.203
plans to re-engage in the marketplace as they were,2755.586,2.602
prior to this.,2758.188,1.268
And I think that is a major aspect.,2759.456,1.702
Hold on. Wait.,2761.158,0.934
"The Press: Wait, wait, wait. Second.",2762.092,1.602
Thank you.,2763.694,0.767
"From yesterday, I had a nominations question, is",2764.461,3.037
there something that&amp;#39;s preventing the White House,2767.498,1.334
from submitting the nominations of Sonny,2768.832,1.769
Perdue for Agriculture and Alex Acosta for Labor?,2770.601,3.803
Mr. Spicer: I believe Alex Acosta was sent up to the,2774.404,1.368
Hill earlier today.,2775.772,3.871
We should have an announcement officially,2779.643,1.268
"out, so, sometimes there&amp;#39;s a little bit of a lag -- I",2780.911,2.236
apologize -- between my office and -- but that,2783.147,1.801
"one&amp;#39;s up, and I&amp;#39;ll check on Sonny Perdue.",2784.948,1.535
I think some of it&amp;#39;s just in coordination with the,2786.483,2.002
"-- with the Senate, so pardon my time. Tray.",2788.485,4.271
The Press: Can I -- I have two questions for you.,2792.756,2.002
"First, will the President offer a correction to his",2794.758,1.969
tweet this morning that states that 122 prisoners,2796.727,2.669
were released from Gitmo by the Obama,2799.396,2.202
Administration and then returned,2801.598,1.201
to the battlefield?,2802.799,1.635
Can you take that first?,2804.434,1.068
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, I mean, obviously, the President",2805.502,1.535
meant in totality that number that had been,2807.037,2.369
"released on the battlefield, that have",2809.406,2.169
been released from Gitmo since individuals,2811.575,3.77
have been released.,2815.345,0.901
"So, that is -- that is correct.",2816.246,2.403
"The Press: My second question is, is the White",2818.649,0.867
House concerned about this new information that came,2819.516,6.073
out in Wiki leaks today that U.S.,2825.589,3.103
intelligence agencies are potentially --,2828.692,1.168
purposefully providing vulnerabilities to tech,2829.86,0.734
products in the United States?,2830.594,1.468
The Press: I&amp;#39;m not going to comment on that.,2832.062,1.969
"I think, obviously, that&amp;#39;s something that has not",2834.031,2.536
"been fully evaluated, and if it was, I would not",2836.567,1.735
comment from here on that. Kevin.,2838.302,2.435
"The Press: So, I was going to ask about branding.",2840.737,3.137
"The President has, in the past, put his name on",2843.874,3.136
buildings and different products.,2847.01,0.768
"When it comes to healthcare, does the White",2847.778,1.535
House feel that the bill presented today should be,2849.313,2.202
known as &amp;quot;Trumpcare&amp;quot; from here on out?,2851.515,1.868
I always asked the Secretary.,2853.383,1.669
And at what point do you think the transitions,2855.052,1.902
should go away from Obamacare to the,2856.954,2.035
new administration?,2858.989,1.168
"Mr. Spicer: Well, as soon as it&amp;#39;s repealed, we can",2860.157,1.301
get rid of that.,2861.458,1.268
I think that will happen quickly.,2862.726,1.668
"And, as Secretary Price mentioned, I think we&amp;#39;re",2864.394,1.902
less concerned with labels right now and more in,2866.296,2.603
"terms of action and results, and I think",2868.899,1.868
"that&amp;#39;s been what our focus has been, is getting that",2870.767,3.07
cost down and getting that choice back,2873.837,1.468
that we mentioned. Yeah.,2875.305,1.268
"The Press: Sean, DHS is reportedly considering",2876.573,2.836
separating families that crossed the,2879.409,2.169
border illegally.,2881.578,1.035
How does the President feel about that?,2882.613,1.301
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m going to -- that&amp;#39;s a DHS matter; I,2883.914,1.968
"mean, we don&amp;#39;t get involved in either Customs",2885.882,3.404
"or ICE enforcement, so I think that&amp;#39;s a question",2889.286,1.668
better reserved to both DHS and Ice specifically. Jim.,2890.954,3.003
"The Press: Oh, thanks, Sean.",2893.957,2.069
"Yeah, I have an Obamacare question.",2896.026,3.737
One of the criticisms on this is that there is,2899.763,2.302
still a de facto individual mandate because,2902.065,3.27
it allows insurance companies to increase,2905.335,2.403
premiums up to 30% if people -- if there&amp;#39;s a,2907.738,3.904
gap in coverage.,2911.642,2.369
"And I have one more, but --",2914.011,1.134
"Mr. Spicer: Well, that&amp;#39;s not -- I mean, that&amp;#39;s not",2915.145,1.602
"a -- I mean, the difference is, under the",2916.747,2.135
"current bill that&amp;#39;s here, if you don&amp;#39;t buy",2918.882,2.603
"insurance, you pay a fine.",2921.485,3.103
"Under the current bill, you don&amp;#39;t have -- there&amp;#39;s",2924.588,1.868
nothing that mandates you to buy insurance.,2926.456,2.169
That&amp;#39;s up to an individual.,2928.625,1.802
"So, it -- I mean, by its very definition, it is not",2930.427,3.837
-- can&amp;#39;t be considered that.,2934.264,2.036
What&amp;#39;s your second one?,2936.3,1.968
"The Press: Well, I mean, if you don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a",2938.268,1.301
de facto mandate in the sense that --,2939.569,1.802
"Mr. Spicer: Well, it can&amp;#39;t be.",2941.371,0.701
"The Press: -- there&amp;#39;s a penalty in place,",2942.072,1.935
as there is now.,2944.007,1.001
"I mean, not by the government, but it is by",2945.008,1.302
insurance companies.,2946.31,1.001
"Mr. Spicer: Right, but there&amp;#39;s no -- there --",2947.311,1.134
"that&amp;#39;s -- I mean, I think you answered your own",2948.445,1.268
question on that one.,2949.713,1.568
"The Press: I have one more, I have one more.",2951.281,1.135
I just --,2952.416,0.5
Mr. Spicer: Okay.,2952.916,0.501
The Press: The President has blamed Democrats in,2953.417,3.403
the Senate for blocking the Cabinet.,2956.82,2.402
"Last Thursday, the Republicans actually",2959.222,3.671
called a couple to recess early previously adjourn,2962.893,4.938
"on Thursday, or, previous they called a recess the",2967.831,2.236
week before.,2970.067,2.969
Does the President have any plans to call for the,2973.036,3.304
Senate to remain in session and Congress to,2976.34,3.703
stay in session until they approve nominees and maybe,2980.043,3.504
even also kill Obamacare?,2983.547,1.434
"Mr. Spicer: Well, this is -- this isn&amp;#39;t",2984.981,1.202
a Republican issue.,2986.183,1.968
"I mean, it&amp;#39;s not Republicans that are",2988.151,1.335
playing beat-the-clock on a lot of these nominees.,2989.486,3.77
As -- and we&amp;#39;ve discussed this since the transition,2993.256,2.136
"time, when there were several nominees that,",2995.392,2.369
"frankly, weren&amp;#39;t even considered controversial",2997.761,1.935
by their -- by the standards of senate,2999.696,3.904
"Democratic leadership, and yet have been held up over",3003.6,1.735
and over again.,3005.335,1.235
I don&amp;#39;t think -- that&amp;#39;s a very different scenario,3006.57,2.369
"than going back and being with constituents, which",3008.939,2.636
was on the Senate schedule.,3011.575,1.635
"So, I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s a synonymous thing.",3013.21,2.135
But do we have Michael Medved ready to go on --,3015.345,2.369
for a state question?,3017.714,2.102
Michael.,3019.816,2.67
"The Press: Yes, hello.",3022.486,0.934
"Sean, thank you very much.",3023.42,1.635
"Obviously, today there was a big emphasis on",3025.055,2.536
"Obamacare, which is profoundly important to",3027.591,2.369
the American people.,3029.96,1.701
But it seems that too often in the last several,3031.661,3.37
"weeks, the administration has gotten distracted and",3035.031,5.339
media have gotten distracted by talk of,3040.37,1.869
wiretapping at Trump Tower or the President calling,3042.239,2.536
"his predecessor a bad and sick guy, or criticizing",3044.775,4.237
the ratings of Celebrity Apprentice.,3049.012,3.103
Do you think the White House could do a better,3052.115,2.77
"job of focusing on the issues that really matter,",3054.885,2.602
"the reforms that matter to the American people,",3057.487,2.469
rather than getting distracted by these,3059.956,4.572
"subsidiary conflicts, as we move forward into the",3064.528,1.534
coming months?,3066.062,1.268
Mr. Spicer: Thanks Michael.,3067.33,0.868
"You know, respectfully, I would say that we have",3068.198,2.169
been focused.,3070.367,0.667
We&amp;#39;re here talking about Obamacare and the need to,3071.034,2.569
drive down the cost and access for healthcare for,3073.603,3.37
every American.,3076.973,0.701
I think that&amp;#39;s a pretty significant thing,3077.674,4.071
to be focused on.,3081.745,0.834
Yesterday we were talking about The President&amp;#39;s,3082.579,2.202
effort to continue to keep the nation safe; to make,3084.781,2.736
sure that people aren&amp;#39;t coming into the country,3087.517,1.502
who aren&amp;#39;t here for peaceful purposes.,3089.019,4.171
The President has talked to almost,3093.19,1.101
50 world leaders.,3094.291,2.435
He&amp;#39;s had 30 plus executive actions on all sorts of,3096.726,3.537
"stuff from regulatory aspects, to things that",3100.263,2.57
will create more jobs.,3102.833,1.568
I think that&amp;#39;s a fairly focused effort.,3104.401,2.969
"That being said, I think, look, whether he was",3107.37,1.669
"Candidate Trump, President-elect Trump, or",3109.039,1.935
"now President Trump, the President has always made",3110.974,2.669
it very clear that -- or not he made it clear but I,3113.643,5.372
think the voters made it clear that one of the,3119.015,1.001
things that they appreciate about him is,3120.016,1.202
his ability to be authentic and to speak,3121.218,1.901
very forcefully and very directly with the American,3123.119,2.837
"people, and that&amp;#39;s an aspect that I think was",3125.956,1.935
"central to why he was elected, is because he&amp;#39;s",3127.891,2.97
not a canned politician that&amp;#39;s going to give this,3130.861,3.903
same staid answers,3134.764,1.235
over and over again. Sarah.,3135.999,2.636
The Press: Going back to (inaudible) question if,3138.635,1.268
conservatives have started to call this Obamacare.,3139.903,2.035
Why -- President Trump has promised to fully repeal,3141.938,3.504
Obamacare but this bill leaves a lot of the,3145.442,1.968
structure of Obamacare intact.,3147.41,4.004
"If this is the policy that passes, is President Trump",3151.414,1.202
confident in the future that he can say that he,3152.616,1.868
fully repealed Obamacare?,3154.484,1.535
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, absolutely.",3156.019,1.301
"As I mentioned, I mean, the first half of the bill",3157.32,1.936
that we put forward repeals it.,3159.256,1.401
There are three things.,3160.657,1.101
"I mean, each phase that we&amp;#39;ve talked about; phase",3161.758,2.369
"one, phase two, and phase three -- there&amp;#39;s a repeal",3164.127,1.969
and replace aspect in each one.,3166.096,2.669
But Republicans and conservatives have been,3168.765,2.102
talking about competition and driving costs down for,3170.867,5.105
"decades now; selling across state lines, small",3175.972,2.736
business pooling.,3178.708,2.036
All of those things have been part of conservative,3180.744,3.103
"plans for a long time, and I think instilling that",3183.847,2.369
"competition in it, allowing more access.",3186.216,3.437
"I mean, I think there&amp;#39;s a big difference.",3189.653,1.401
"There is no -- you know, we have for the longest",3191.054,2.302
"time; if you&amp;#39;re a conservative, I mean, you",3193.356,2.336
think about this right now that you have -- anyone,3195.692,2.169
who has an employer-based -- their job comes from an,3197.861,2.536
"employer that gives them healthcare, they&amp;#39;re",3200.397,2.736
getting a subsidy.,3203.133,1.501
They&amp;#39;re getting a credit.,3204.634,0.834
"They don&amp;#39;t pay taxes on their health care, and",3205.468,2.236
their employer doesn&amp;#39;t either.,3207.704,1.702
That&amp;#39;s a huge disadvantage to anyone who&amp;#39;s a sole,3209.406,2.736
"proprietor or owns a small business, and so, frankly,",3212.142,2.836
to allow the playing field to be leveled and allow,3214.978,3.704
"small businesses, which are, frankly, the job",3218.682,1.868
creators in this country; to allow entrepreneurs and,3220.55,2.903
self-starters to get the same tax treatment that a,3223.453,2.636
Fortune 500 company gets you is a very,3226.089,2.603
conservative principle.,3228.692,1.835
"And, again, I think -- look, one of the things",3230.527,2.169
"that&amp;#39;s important, Sara, is for all of the people who",3232.696,3.136
"have concerns about this, especially on the right:",3235.832,1.101
look at the size.,3236.933,1.969
This is the Democrats.,3238.902,2.069
This is us.,3240.971,1.067
"There is -- I mean, you can&amp;#39;t get any clearer, in",3242.038,3.07
"terms of this is government, this is not,",3245.108,3.47
and I think that part of the reason the visual is,3248.578,1.869
important is that when you actually look at the,3250.447,3.803
difference you realize this is what big,3254.25,1.936
government does.,3256.186,2.102
It crowds out competition.,3258.288,1.301
It drives up prices.,3259.589,1.435
It stifles entrepreneurship and,3261.024,1.602
"innovation; doctors leaving the markets, more",3262.626,2.102
and more people not taking Medicaid or Tricare.,3264.728,2.836
That should concern people.,3267.564,1.802
When you&amp;#39;ve got veterans that can&amp;#39;t -- because most,3269.366,1.301
of the time Medicaid and Tricare are tied together.,3270.667,3.27
"So, when you have those systems not accepted by",3273.937,2.002
"doctors, that means the lowest of our -- the",3275.939,3.203
people on the low-income scale and people who have,3279.142,1.835
served our country have fewer and fewer choices.,3280.977,2.202
That alone should be a problem and concerning,3283.179,1.669
for many people.,3284.848,1.034
"But the premium spikes are another problem because,",3285.882,2.102
"again, even if you&amp;#39;re in the exchange, now you&amp;#39;re",3287.984,2.136
seeing over and over again that happen.,3290.12,1.535
You&amp;#39;re also seeing young people decide that they&amp;#39;d,3291.655,2.969
rather just pay a penalty because the cost of those,3294.624,2.636
basic programs is out of reach for a lot of young,3297.26,2.936
people who are just entering the job market.,3300.196,2.336
"But, again, I think the greatest illustration of",3302.532,2.336
the differences in the approaches is that size.,3304.868,2.702
"Our bill, which is a tenth of the size, does repeal",3307.57,3.437
and replace and what their bill just did in massive,3311.007,3.003
"government bureaucracy, and that is a",3314.01,1.802
big difference. Jim.,3315.812,2.035
"The Press: I just want to ask you -- I mean, you",3317.847,1.769
have the Health and Human Services secretary out,3319.616,1.835
here and you just talked about this is the,3321.451,1.802
"Republican bill, this is the Democrat bill.",3323.253,1.401
Is that The President&amp;#39;s bill?,3324.654,2.269
Is that his health care bill?,3326.923,1.034
"Mr. Spicer: That is a bill that we have worked with,",3327.957,1.335
with Congress.,3329.292,0.968
We feel very good about where it is.,3330.26,2.202
"We are looking forward -- as I mentioned earlier,",3332.462,2.436
The President&amp;#39;s meeting with the Whip team to,3334.898,2.836
encourage them to support it and to build it out.,3337.734,4.538
"I don&amp;#39;t think, and I&amp;#39;m not trying to be cute here,",3342.272,1.268
but I think it&amp;#39;s not his bill or their bill.,3343.54,0.834
It&amp;#39;s a bill that we have worked on with them,3344.374,1.501
together.,3345.875,1.235
We&amp;#39;re very proud of where it stands now.,3347.11,2.102
"The big difference, Jim, is that, unlike before, as",3349.212,2.87
"I mentioned, when the Democrats jammed it down",3352.082,1.635
peoples&amp;#39; throat and said -- waited to get that,3353.717,2.669
"sixtieth vote before Senator, with Senator",3356.386,0.967
"Kennedy still around, and then basically said",3357.353,2.136
literally you will have to wait and see what it looks,3359.489,4.538
like before we pass it.,3364.027,1.134
We not only posted it out there for everybody to,3365.161,2.202
"look at, but by sending it through regular order, not",3367.363,2.67
"just putting it up for a House vote, but sending it",3370.033,1.768
through the committee process allows,3371.801,2.403
"Republicans, Democrats, and independents alike to",3374.204,2.569
"offer up amendments and suggestions, and the House",3376.773,3.637
will work its will.,3380.41,1.601
"Now, we will continue to give guidance and thoughts",3382.011,2.937
"and suggestions, but I think The President&amp;#39;s core",3384.948,2.202
principles are what&amp;#39;re going to guide us as we,3387.15,2.436
head through the Hill and then the House and then to,3389.586,1.067
the Senate.,3390.653,0.768
The Press: Just one quick follow up on Jonathan,3391.421,1.601
Karl&amp;#39;s question because the President made a very,3393.022,2.369
"serious allegation over the weekend, and I think",3395.391,2.803
we would all be remiss if we went through this,3398.194,1.635
briefing and not tried to get you on camera to at,3399.829,3.337
least offer us some evidence.,3403.166,1.668
Where is the evidence?,3404.834,1.368
Where is the proof that President Obama bugged,3406.202,3.337
President Trump?,3409.539,1.735
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I answered this question",3411.274,1.101
yesterday on camera on your air.,3412.375,2.202
"So, just so we&amp;#39;re clear, I know this is now --",3414.577,2.236
will be twice.,3416.813,1.735
But I think I&amp;#39;ve made it clear yesterday --,3418.548,1.101
"The Press: But since yesterday, since yesterday --",3419.649,1.602
Mr. Spicer: Nothing has changed.,3421.251,0.967
"The Press: -- is there any new proof,",3422.218,0.701
any new evidence?,3422.919,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: No, it&amp;#39;s not a question of -- it&amp;#39;s not a",3423.586,1.168
question of new proof or less proof or whatever.,3424.754,2.169
"The answer is the same, and I think that -- which",3426.923,2.502
is that I think that there is a concern about what,3429.425,2.803
happened in the 2016 election.,3432.228,2.002
The House and Senate Intelligence Committee,3434.23,3.704
have the staff and the capabilities and the,3437.934,1.235
processes in place to look at this in a way that&amp;#39;s,3439.169,1.267
"objective, and that&amp;#39;s where it should be done.",3440.436,1.802
"And, frankly, if you&amp;#39;ve seen the response from --",3442.238,2.069
especially on the House side but as well as the,3444.307,1.468
"Senate, they welcome this.",3445.775,1.935
"And so, let&amp;#39;s let the Senate do their job and",3447.71,2.103
"the House -- excuse me, intelligence committees,",3449.813,1.568
and then report back to the American people.,3451.381,1.768
The Press: Will the President withdraw,3453.149,1.068
the accusation?,3454.217,1.702
Does he have any -- Mr. Spicer: Why would he,3455.919,1.434
"withdraw it until it&amp;#39;s -- I mean, until",3457.353,1.836
it&amp;#39;s adjudicated?,3459.189,1.568
That&amp;#39;s what we&amp;#39;re asking is for them to look at,3460.757,1.701
this and see if there is --,3462.458,0.935
The Press: No regrets for them --,3463.393,0.767
Mr. Spicer: No --,3464.16,0.567
The Press: -- about raising this accusation?,3464.727,0.968
"Mr. Spicer: -- absolutely not, and I think that what",3465.695,1.735
"he wants them to do is to look into wiretapping,",3467.43,2.436
"other surveillance and, again, as I mentioned",3469.866,1.835
"before, the other leaks that are threatening our",3471.701,2.202
national security.,3473.903,1.035
You&amp;#39;re seeing the leaks happen over,3474.938,1.067
and over again.,3476.005,1.135
"They come out throughout the administration,",3477.14,2.436
"throughout government, and undermine national",3479.576,1.968
"security, and I think the appropriate thing to do is",3481.544,2.202
to ask the House and the Senate to look into it.,3483.746,1.969
Glenn Thrush.,3485.715,1.068
"The Press: Sean, so to follow up on the",3486.783,4.071
"follow-up, in terms of -- you were given an",3490.854,3.47
opportunity on air to say whether or not the,3494.324,2.602
President still supported Director Comey.,3496.926,2.403
"Does the President support Director Comey, and then a",3499.329,3.036
quick follow-up?,3502.365,1.034
Mr. Spicer: I have no reason to,3503.399,0.901
believe he doesn&amp;#39;t.,3504.3,1.001
"He has not suggested that to me so, now to the",3505.301,1.936
non-follow-up to the --,3507.237,2.902
The Press: Have you seen any evidence yourself?,3510.139,2.169
Has the evidence been shared with you or other,3512.308,2.436
"members, senior members of the President&amp;#39;s staff, as",3514.744,2.402
to why he made this particular accusation?,3517.146,3.771
"Mr. Spicer: As far as me, no, I&amp;#39;ve not in a position",3520.917,3.07
that that would be regularly part of my daily,3523.987,1.968
duties for The President to sit down and,3525.955,2.102
go through that.,3528.057,1.001
"That&amp;#39;s probably a level above my pay grade but, as",3529.058,2.536
"I&amp;#39;ve mentioned, as I&amp;#39;ve mentioned, I think the",3531.594,2.303
President believes that the appropriate place for,3533.897,3.903
this to be adjudicated is for the House and Senate,3537.8,1.969
"Intelligence Committees who have the clearances,",3539.769,1.602
"the staff, the processes to go through this, look",3541.371,3.036
"at it, and report back. Yeah.",3544.407,2.369
The Press: Did he share it with --?,3546.776,1.368
"Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to get -- look, as the",3548.144,1.201
"President made very clear, Glenn --",3549.345,1.835
The Press: Did he share it with his national,3551.18,1.702
security advisors.,3552.882,1.001
Mr. Spicer: -- I&amp;#39;m not going to -- as the,3553.883,0.667
President said in his statement that he issued,3554.55,1.035
on Sunday we&amp;#39;re not to have further comment on,3555.585,0.967
this until this matter is resolved. Yes.,3556.552,1.936
The Press: Two quick questions.,3558.488,2.002
"So, I&amp;#39;ll just follow up on the follow up (laughs).",3560.49,3.303
"So, does the White House feel that it&amp;#39;s appropriate",3563.793,2.102
-- you say that you want it to be adjudicated by,3565.895,1.702
the congressional committees.,3567.597,3.303
Mr. Spicer: Right.,3570.9,0.467
The Press: But the President made,3571.367,0.801
declarative statements --,3572.168,1.001
Mr. Spicer: Right.,3573.169,0.567
The Press: -- on Twitter.,3573.736,0.868
"So, I guess does -- is the White House position that",3574.604,3.904
The President can make declarative statements,3578.508,2.736
"about a former president, basically committing a",3581.244,1.768
"crime, and then the congressional committees",3583.012,4.038
"should look into that, basically to prove it?",3587.05,2.869
"I mean, I guess --",3589.919,1.101
Mr. Spicer: It&amp;#39;s not a question.,3591.02,0.701
"No, but I take issue with -- it&amp;#39;s not a question",3591.721,2.135
of prove it.,3593.856,1.502
"I think, as I&amp;#39;ve said now five times on the",3595.358,3.036
"follow-up to the follow-up, that it&amp;#39;s not a",3598.394,2.002
question of prove it; is that they have the,3600.396,2.136
resources and the clearances and the staff,3602.532,2.936
to fully and thoroughly and comprehensively,3605.468,3.17
"investigate this, and then issue a report as to what",3608.638,2.869
their findings are.,3611.507,2.603
"The Press: So, but President Trump&amp;#39;s Twitter",3614.11,1.134
statements shouldn&amp;#39;t be taken at face,3615.244,1.402
value about what --,3616.646,1.401
"Mr. Spicer: Sure, it should.",3618.047,0.701
"I mean, no, I mean, there&amp;#39;s nothing, as I",3618.748,3.604
mentioned to Jim; it&amp;#39;s not that he&amp;#39;s walking anything,3622.352,1.267
back or regretting.,3623.619,0.835
He&amp;#39;s just saying that they have the appropriate venue,3624.454,2.802
and capabilities to review this.,3627.256,2.169
"Margaret, I&amp;#39;m sorry.",3629.425,1.101
"The Press: So, on the Obamacare replacement, so",3630.526,3.571
you&amp;#39;ve said that it&amp;#39;ll be in phases and that you&amp;#39;re,3634.097,2.335
going to need additional legislation.,3636.432,1.635
"So, just to clarify, are the costs savings that you",3638.067,5.272
guys are projecting --,3643.339,1.068
Mr. Spicer: Right.,3644.407,0.801
The Press: -- is that dependent on phase three,3645.208,2.469
on the national competition plan because --,3647.677,1.635
"Mr. Spicer: Well, it&amp;#39;s not dependent.",3649.312,1.935
I think that in order to see it fully come to,3651.247,2.136
"fruition, yeah, you have to see all parts of it but",3653.383,3.303
the way that it was passed doesn&amp;#39;t allow for -- the,3656.686,3.637
way that it was passed is almost the same way that,3660.323,4.071
"we&amp;#39;re going through this now, which is they passed",3664.394,1.768
certain things.,3666.162,2.002
"Then the secretary of Health and Human Services,",3668.164,2.469
"at the time, was granted significant regulatory",3670.633,5.205
authority that allowed her to do certain things at,3675.838,2.97
the time to implement pieces of Obamacare that,3678.808,3.604
we now have to act backwards and go almost in,3682.412,3.536
the same steps to do what they did to lay it out.,3685.948,3.437
"We&amp;#39;ve got to repeal it, and then we&amp;#39;ve got to",3689.385,1.635
replace it with the plan that&amp;#39;s going,3691.02,1.902
to do the same.,3692.922,0.601
"Certain things can be done in the same way, and",3693.523,1.635
certain things can&amp;#39;t.,3695.158,0.901
It&amp;#39;s just -- it literally depends on how,3696.059,1.768
that was done.,3697.827,0.968
John Frederick.,3698.795,0.8
The Press.,3699.595,1.235
"Sean, in the replacement plan, it says that the",3700.83,4.938
states that accepted the Medicaid expansion money,3705.768,3.27
would continue to be funded.,3709.038,2.136
So what is the message you have to Republican state,3711.174,4.537
legislators that thought they were fiscally,3715.711,3.17
responsible in rejecting Medicaid expansion in,3718.881,3.47
"their states, and now they didn&amp;#39;t get -- they didn&amp;#39;t",3722.351,1.969
get the federal dollars on either and?,3724.32,3.27
What is your --,3727.59,1.668
"Mr. Spicer: I think, yeah, I think what we need to do",3729.258,3.604
"is to make sure, as The President said in his",3732.862,2.169
statements as Secretary Price did; we&amp;#39;ve got to,3735.031,2.202
make sure that we continue to protect people through,3737.233,3.103
"this transition process, let the bill work its way,",3740.336,2.97
but this is the first time as we address the Medicaid,3743.306,2.869
portion of this: this is probably the first time,3746.175,2.236
that we&amp;#39;ve really addressed an entitlement,3748.411,1.902
aspect of something in almost 30 years.,3750.313,2.235
"So, I think we&amp;#39;ve got to let this piece of it work",3752.548,2.803
"its way through the House, but there is -- remember,",3755.351,3.07
one of the things that happened through the,3758.421,1.535
Medicaid expansion was the goal has always been of,3759.956,2.802
Medicaid to help people who are disabled or poor,3762.758,3.471
or met a specific number of criteria.,3766.229,2.469
"For the first time in Obamacare, we expanded",3768.698,2.302
"Obamacare or the Obama administration did,",3771,2.569
"rather, to able-bodied individuals that, in a way",3773.569,3.27
"that had never been done before, and it was not a",3776.839,0.968
specific class.,3777.807,1.535
That&amp;#39;s led largely to the ballooning cost.,3779.342,4.137
I think a lot of the reforms that will be,3783.479,0.934
"contained in this bill will address that, but I",3784.413,3.17
think we&amp;#39;ve got to let it work its will,3787.583,4.872
through the process.,3792.455,1.334
Alexis.,3793.789,0.534
"The Press: Sean, I want to ask you two communications",3794.323,1.202
questions on two topics.,3795.525,0.7
Because the President gave himself a middling grade,3796.225,2.503
"on communication, let me ask you about the",3798.728,2.903
experience that the previous administration,3801.631,1.535
had when Obamacare was going through,3803.166,1.968
its own phases.,3805.134,1.201
The President -- President Obama said that the,3806.335,3.003
opposition to the legislation was able to,3809.338,3.904
seize the opportunity while it was being,3813.242,2.336
legislated to create public perceptions about,3815.578,5.138
what was in the legislation.,3820.716,1.335
So my question is on ACA.,3822.051,2.903
What is The President going to do to improve his,3824.954,1.535
"communications, to be out there explaining what is",3826.489,3.47
"in the bill, to work with lawmakers -- that&amp;#39;s the",3829.959,2.402
"first question, and then I&amp;#39;ll ask you the next one?",3832.361,1.602
"Mr. Spicer: Okay, thank you.",3833.963,0.834
"So, on the first one, as I&amp;#39;ve mentioned, I continue",3834.797,2.403
-- he&amp;#39;s had and he continues to have,3837.2,3.436
significant outreach to members of Congress.,3840.636,2.369
He&amp;#39;s talked to health insurers.,3843.005,1.001
"I mean, I think we&amp;#39;ve read out a lot of the",3844.006,1.702
"activities the last couple of weeks and, literally,",3845.708,1.902
in just within an hour he&amp;#39;s going to sit down,3847.61,2.402
with the House deputy Whip team to talk about the,3850.012,2.67
legislative piece of this in the House.,3852.682,2.369
"So, this is going to be a very aggressive, laser",3855.051,3.069
like focus of this administration over the,3858.12,2.236
"next, you know, month or two, to get this thing",3860.356,2.536
through the House and then moved over to the Senate.,3862.892,2.169
But there&amp;#39;s a big difference Alexis.,3865.061,1.301
What we&amp;#39;re doing is vastly different.,3866.362,3.27
"They were expanding government, promising",3869.632,3.17
"people something, and I think what&amp;#39;s happened is",3872.802,2.002
there was a lot of -- there was a lot of,3874.804,3.27
difference with how the approaches happened.,3878.074,2.769
"Right now, the American people -- no matter where",3880.843,1.835
"you are, you understand the state of your health",3882.678,3.17
"care, the costs that you&amp;#39;re seeing and the lack",3885.848,2.236
of choice that you&amp;#39;ve now been presented with.,3888.084,1.801
And in many cases you realize that when you go,3889.885,1.969
in to see the doctor or a loved one goes in to see,3891.854,1.869
the doctor that they&amp;#39;re not getting -- they&amp;#39;re not,3893.723,1.968
"either able to get in, they&amp;#39;re not taking the",3895.691,2.503
"Medicare or the exchange insurance that they got,",3898.194,3.403
"the costs are going out of control, and I think it&amp;#39;s",3901.597,2.136
really interesting.,3903.733,1.167
"I mean, one of the things that Dr. Price mentioned",3904.9,1.669
that is so apropos of this is having a card does not,3906.569,3.904
mean you have insurance.,3910.473,1.601
It&amp;#39;s like handing someone a blank check.,3912.074,1.936
It doesn&amp;#39;t mean that you have money.,3914.01,1.368
"It means that you have a check, and I think what",3915.378,1.735
we&amp;#39;ve seen over the last few years with Obamacare,3917.113,3.203
"is you can have an insurance card, but that",3920.316,2.235
"doesn&amp;#39;t mean someone&amp;#39;s going to take it, and it",3922.551,1.869
sure doesn&amp;#39;t mean that it&amp;#39;s going,3924.42,1.068
to be affordable.,3925.488,1.368
And there&amp;#39;s a big difference between having,3926.856,1.802
"a card and having health care that&amp;#39;s affordable,",3928.658,2.936
and that&amp;#39;s the difference that we&amp;#39;re trying to solve,3931.594,1.935
"right now, and I think -- so when it comes to",3933.529,2.302
"communication, I think one of the things that&amp;#39;s",3935.831,2.203
really helpful is that part of the sell,3938.034,2.035
is done for us.,3940.069,1.101
The American people understand the state of,3941.17,2.503
their health care.,3943.673,0.8
They understand how much they&amp;#39;re paying for it.,3944.473,2.136
They&amp;#39;ve gone to see a doctor or gone to a,3946.609,1.601
"hospital or had a notice from their carrier saying,",3948.21,3.204
"&amp;quot;We are no longer part of this,&amp;quot; or their employer",3951.414,2.335
"says, &amp;quot;Hey, whatever your particular carrier is,&amp;quot;",3953.749,2.67
and I&amp;#39;m not going to -- &amp;quot;Is no longer available.,3956.419,2.269
We&amp;#39;re switching you into this.&amp;quot;,3958.688,1.901
"And so, for so many Americans, health care is",3960.589,2.937
"a very, very real part of their daily experience",3963.526,3.904
because they&amp;#39;re caring for themselves or dealing with,3967.43,1.501
an ailment or dealing with children or a loved one or,3968.931,2.436
someone else in their family where they&amp;#39;re,3971.367,1.468
seeing firsthand the devastation and disaster,3972.835,4.338
that Obamacare has caused,3977.173,1.134
them in their personal life.,3978.307,1.535
"So I think there&amp;#39;s a welcoming of this effort,",3979.842,2.169
and I think it&amp;#39;s a lot harder -- it&amp;#39;s a lot,3982.011,1.435
easier for us to go in -- because we don&amp;#39;t have to,3983.446,1.902
explain the problem.,3985.348,1.234
"People are living it, and I think for them to",3986.582,1.668
"understand what we&amp;#39;re giving you is more choice,",3988.25,3.571
greater competition.,3991.821,1.234
We&amp;#39;re incentivizing more people to be part of the,3993.055,1.702
"process, and we&amp;#39;re going to be driving down costs",3994.757,2.469
of those premiums.,3997.226,0.701
You had a second.,3997.927,1.268
"The Press: So, the second question on communications --",3999.195,0.767
Mr. Spicer: Yeah.,3999.962,0.401
The Press. -- had to do with,4000.363,0.967
The President&amp;#39;s assertion,4001.33,2.136
about the wiretapping.,4003.466,0.934
Mr. Spicer: Yeah.,4004.4,1.268
The Press: Because the White House wants this now,4005.668,1.635
to be handled by the legislative branch and in,4007.303,2.736
"confidence and classification, can we",4010.039,2.602
"count on The President to himself, while this",4012.641,2.369
"investigation is going on, to cease and desist using",4015.01,4.071
Twitter or any other public venue to make,4019.081,2.503
accusations that are in public but he will not,4021.584,3.47
respond to in public?,4025.054,2.002
Mr. Spicer: With respect to this particular,4027.056,1.134
"situation, I&amp;#39;ll ask that and I&amp;#39;ll get back",4028.19,2.97
to you on that.,4031.16,0.634
John Gizzi.,4031.794,0.567
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",4032.361,0.934
Just getting back to the question about if one,4033.295,3.471
likes his or her health care they can keep it.,4036.766,3.903
"In 2013 Congressman Fred Upton, then chairman of",4040.669,4.171
"the House Energy Committee, offered",4044.84,1.936
legislation that put precisely those words into,4046.776,4.771
"law, and it received the votes of every Republican",4051.547,3.604
member in the House and between 40 and 50,4055.151,2.802
"Democrats, and then it died in the Senate.",4057.953,3.337
Would the administration support a revival of the,4061.29,3.27
"Upton Amendment; in other words, putting the right",4064.56,3.837
"to keep one&amp;#39;s health care plan and doctor, if he or",4068.397,3.137
"she liked it, today?",4071.534,3.169
"Mr. Spicer: I mean, I think that&amp;#39;s the goal.",4074.703,1.669
I don&amp;#39;t want to start talking about what we&amp;#39;re,4076.372,1.201
"going to -- as we go through the process, we&amp;#39;ve",4077.573,2.202
now put our stamp on this and sent it to the House.,4079.775,2.703
It will work its will as amendments come up through,4082.478,1.802
regular order.,4084.28,2.002
"You know, our team will weigh in on those with",4086.282,2.769
"their staff and, again, the President&amp;#39;s meeting",4089.051,2.035
with the Whip team today.,4091.086,1.135
I don&amp;#39;t want to start saying we&amp;#39;re going to,4092.221,1.435
support this amendment or that amendment now.,4093.656,1.535
"But I think, generally speaking, obviously, the",4095.191,2.202
goal is to make sure that people get a plan that,4097.393,1.802
"they like, that&amp;#39;s affordable, that meets",4099.195,2.902
"what they need to have met, that they shouldn&amp;#39;t",4102.097,1.769
have to have a one-size-fits-all,4103.866,4.805
government instilled health care system that,4108.671,1.201
"doesn&amp;#39;t offer any choice or, frankly, isn&amp;#39;t",4109.872,1.301
tailored to the needs that they have.,4111.173,1.902
I think that&amp;#39;s an important thing. John.,4113.075,2.736
"The Press: Sean, right now you&amp;#39;re two votes short of",4115.811,3.504
passing repeal and replace in the Senate because,4119.315,2.235
you&amp;#39;ve got four Republican senators who are saying,4121.55,2.803
they can&amp;#39;t support the bill because of rolling,4124.353,2.436
back the Medicaid expansion.,4126.789,1.735
What do you say to those senators who are very,4128.524,1.902
"concerned that people will lose coverage, that this",4130.426,2.502
does not provide enough stability for those people,4132.928,1.602
who rely on Medicaid for their health care?,4134.53,3.403
"Mr. Spicer: Well, there are two things John.",4137.933,1.268
One is we&amp;#39;re at day one.,4139.201,1.769
We&amp;#39;ve got to -- we&amp;#39;re going to go through,4140.97,1.401
the House first.,4142.371,0.934
"So we&amp;#39;ve got a little bit of time, and I think, as",4143.305,2.403
"we go through that process, these senators,",4145.708,2.002
and not just the additional two but I think,4147.71,2.903
and hope that we&amp;#39;ll get additional ones that,4150.613,1.701
"recognize that those people -- you know, as",4152.314,2.403
I&amp;#39;ve said over and over again here it&amp;#39;s -- if we,4154.717,2.769
"do nothing, they&amp;#39;re going to be in a very, very",4157.486,2.469
worse scenario than they are now.,4159.955,2.336
"More and more people -- if you&amp;#39;re on Medicaid, which",4162.291,4.204
"serves so many low-income Americans, they -- as I&amp;#39;ve",4166.495,3.537
"mentioned, they have a card, and that card does",4170.032,2.035
not allow them to go to doctor after doctor who,4172.067,2.436
"are saying, &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re not going to take Medicaid or",4174.503,1.402
"Tricare any longer.&amp;quot; So, I would ask those senators:",4175.905,3.269
&amp;quot;What are you doing to help us work on a bill,4179.174,2.203
"that will get them insured again,&amp;quot; because for too",4181.377,2.435
"many Americans they&amp;#39;ve got a card, but they don&amp;#39;t",4183.812,2.169
"have insurance, and I think that&amp;#39;s a very, very",4185.981,2.169
big thing to -- a distinction to make.,4188.15,3.537
It&amp;#39;s -- they&amp;#39;re the ones who have the,4191.687,2.269
problem right now.,4193.956,1.435
"They&amp;#39;ve got a Medicaid card and nowhere to go,",4195.391,3.336
and what we need to do is to make sure that low,4198.727,1.936
"income Americans, veterans, small business",4200.663,2.602
"owners, individuals who desperately need health",4203.265,3.604
care have options and affordability.,4206.869,2.636
The Press: One other piece of this: you can bring,4209.505,2.669
down the cost of the insurance itself through,4212.174,1.268
"new inefficiencies in the system, selling across",4213.442,4.338
"state lines, but the biggest driver of the",4217.78,2.369
increase in health insurance cost is the,4220.149,1.802
skyrocketing cost of medicine.,4221.951,2.636
Mr. Spicer: Right.,4224.587,0.5
The Press: What in this overall plan do you,4225.087,2.803
propose to do to either cap the rise or,4227.89,3.336
even bring it down?,4231.226,1.068
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think you -- the secretary",4232.294,2.336
"mentioned this, but I mean the cost of",4234.63,0.934
prescription drugs is a --,4235.564,1.368
The Press: That&amp;#39;s one small --,4236.932,0.901
"Mr. Spicer: No, it&amp;#39;s not.",4237.833,0.601
It&amp;#39;s a big factor.,4238.434,1.501
I think that --,4239.935,0.501
"The Press: When you are paying $50,000 out of",4240.436,2.802
pocket to get a stent --,4243.238,1.869
"Mr. Spicer: Right, but again --",4245.107,0.534
"The Press: -- I mean, it&amp;#39;s getting out of control.",4245.641,1.101
"Mr. Spicer: But again, what&amp;#39;s the",4246.742,0.601
biggest thing missing --,4247.343,0.667
The Press: A lot of people believe it&amp;#39;s getting,4248.01,0.567
out of control so...,4248.577,0.567
"Mr. Spicer: Fair enough, fair enough.",4249.144,0.568
The Press: Drugs is one part of it (inaudible),4249.712,0.867
the other part.,4250.579,0.434
"Mr. Spicer: No, no.",4251.013,0.601
The Press: (inaudible),4251.614,0.6
Mr. Spicer: When you talk about procedures or drugs,4252.214,2.97
the biggest thing that&amp;#39;s missing in this whole,4255.184,1.334
equation is competition.,4256.518,2.236
"There&amp;#39;s no -- I mean, we&amp;#39;re down to one plan",4258.754,2.536
in many places.,4261.29,0.934
There&amp;#39;s nothing for these places to compete.,4262.224,2.236
The Press: There&amp;#39;s plenty of competition,4264.46,1.134
between hospitals.,4265.594,0.467
"Mr. Spicer: No, there&amp;#39;s not.",4266.061,0.734
"I mean, that&amp;#39;s fine, but if they know they&amp;#39;re going",4266.795,1.135
"to get the same reimbursement rate, if",4267.93,1.301
"they know that there&amp;#39;s no other options, that plans",4269.231,1.969
"aren&amp;#39;t trying to get people, then that&amp;#39;s",4271.2,2.135
a big difference.,4273.335,0.801
Right now there&amp;#39;s a lack of competition in the,4274.136,1.802
"industry, and I think one of The President&amp;#39;s -- I",4275.938,2.335
"get it may be one part of that, but, you&amp;#39;re right.",4278.273,4.171
"The allover medicine, procedures and such;",4282.444,2.736
there&amp;#39;s a reason he met with drug executives and,4285.18,2.169
talked about getting those costs down; that there is,4287.349,2.403
"a multifaceted approach, and how do we instill",4289.752,2.502
competition?,4292.254,0.601
"How do we drive down costs, but, you&amp;#39;re right?",4292.855,2.002
"We&amp;#39;ve got to do more to get the cost of that down,",4294.857,3.236
"of the procedures, to allow additional options;",4298.093,2.67
"everything that -- it&amp;#39;s the same way that, again,",4300.763,2.235
"think about your insurance, right?",4302.998,2.069
One of the things that was driving up costs in the,4305.067,1.902
past was people were exercising the option of,4306.969,2.836
going to an emergency room over and over again for,4309.805,2.269
"their primary care, and what happened is that you",4312.074,2.869
"saw all of these, you know, &amp;quot;clinics&amp;quot; pop up",4314.943,4.238
from around and insurance carriers actually made it,4319.181,4.705
"cheaper, in terms of co-pays, to go see that",4323.886,2.969
than an emergency room driving people to,4326.855,2.403
somewhere that didn&amp;#39;t continue to drive up,4329.258,1.568
"costs, clog insurance.",4330.826,1.435
That competition alone started saving the plans,4332.261,3.17
money and helping to keep costs down.,4335.431,1.301
We&amp;#39;ve got to instill more aspects of competition in,4336.732,2.869
medicine.,4339.601,0.568
Jennifer.,4340.169,0.5
"The Press: Sean, will you give us an update on the",4340.669,2.069
effort to roll back regulations?,4342.738,1.835
"Has the task force, regulatory and reform task",4344.573,3.403
"forces identified any regulations to roll back,",4347.976,2.303
and have any actually been repealed?,4350.279,1.668
Mr. Spicer: I think that they have had their work,4351.947,2.669
cut out for them.,4354.616,0.568
They&amp;#39;ve started.,4355.184,0.534
As the President has met with the different,4355.718,3.37
"industries and companies, corporations,",4359.088,3.703
associations; that is a constant subject of,4362.791,2.736
"discussion, which is those regulatory aspects of our",4365.527,3.938
economy that are keeping companies from growing and,4369.465,3.003
"expanding and hiring, and so I know that the",4372.468,2.636
domestic policy team and others have been working,4375.104,1.935
"on that, and if I can get further updates on",4377.039,3.236
specific legislation or to specific regulatory,4380.275,3.537
"action, I&amp;#39;ll get back to you.",4383.812,0.868
Hallie.,4384.68,1.101
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",4385.781,0.5
Two topics for you and (inaudible) trying to get,4386.281,2.336
some clarity on something that my colleagues have,4388.617,1.602
tried to follow up on as well.,4390.219,1.201
You&amp;#39;ve said that -- you stated that the President,4391.42,3.603
"stands by his tweets Saturday morning, that",4395.023,1.769
President Obama ordered this wiretap.,4396.792,1.435
You&amp;#39;ve also said that the administration wants,4398.227,1.368
Congress -- and let me just be clear.,4399.595,2.335
He said he found out this information.,4401.93,1.702
You&amp;#39;ve also said that the President wants Congress,4403.632,1.735
to investigate.,4405.367,1.402
"Some members of Congress, by the way, have asked the",4406.769,1.768
White House and asked The President to come forward,4408.537,1.702
with that information.,4410.239,1.101
"So, bottom line, why would The President want",4411.34,2.169
Congress to investigate for information,4413.509,2.235
he already has?,4415.744,1.268
Mr. Spicer: I think there&amp;#39;s a separation of,4417.012,1.502
powers aspect here.,4418.514,0.9
As I mentioned to Jonathan that we think it&amp;#39;s --,4419.414,2.37
The Press: What about resources and time?,4421.784,1.434
Why waste that?,4423.218,0.634
"Mr. Spicer: Well, it&amp;#39;s not a question of waste it.",4423.852,1.268
It&amp;#39;s a question of appropriateness.,4425.12,1.602
"The Press: But if the President has the info,",4426.722,1.802
and I guess what I&amp;#39;m trying to get to is if,4428.524,1.167
he&amp;#39;s sitting on this information that he found,4429.691,1.302
"out, he&amp;#39;s now directing or asking or recommending",4430.993,3.37
that the intelligence committees look into this.,4434.363,1.701
And you&amp;#39;ve talked about they have resources and,4436.064,1.202
"staff, which they do.",4437.266,1.001
Mr. Spicer: Right.,4438.267,0.367
The Press: But why expend those resources and staff,4438.634,1.735
if The President found out this information,4440.369,1.368
and has it?,4441.737,0.567
Mr. Spicer: I think there&amp;#39;s a difference,4442.304,1.835
between directing the Department of Justice,4444.139,1.802
"which may be involved in an ongoing investigation,",4445.941,3.437
"and asking Congress, as a separate body, to look",4449.378,3.904
"into something, and add credibility to the look.",4453.282,3.303
It adds an element that wouldn&amp;#39;t necessarily be,4456.585,3.136
"there if we were directing the Department of Justice,",4459.721,2.837
for example.,4462.558,0.533
"But, again, I think we&amp;#39;ve made it very clear how he",4463.091,2.603
"wants this done and where we go from there, so.",4465.694,1.568
The Press: Second question then.,4467.262,0.868
Millions of Americans are working on their tax,4468.13,3.37
returns right now.,4471.5,0.901
Will the President commit to releasing his tax,4472.401,1.802
"returns for this year, and is he still under audit",4474.203,1.935
for his past returns?,4476.138,1.001
Mr. Spicer: My understanding is he&amp;#39;s,4477.139,1.001
still under audit and I&amp;#39;ll follow up on the question. Yeah.,4478.14,1.735
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",4479.875,0.567
"Question and quick follow up, how do you react to --",4480.442,3.804
how do you understand what we&amp;#39;ve seen on the growing,4484.246,4.738
number of cases at the Canadian border of,4488.984,2.436
"Canadians, born and raised in Canada, with valid",4491.42,2.002
passports being stopped at the border and told just,4493.422,3.537
to go back?,4496.959,1.568
They won&amp;#39;t let them come in the U.S.,4498.527,2.869
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not aware of that.,4501.396,0.801
I think that&amp;#39;s something that probably should be,4502.197,1.835
addressed to the Department of,4504.032,1.068
Homeland Security.,4505.1,0.934
The Press: Do you think that there might be a,4506.034,1.101
misunderstanding of the messages,4507.135,1.368
sent to immigration --,4508.503,0.835
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know.,4509.338,0.467
I think it&amp;#39;s a good question that is probably,4509.805,1.902
best directed toward the Department of,4511.707,1.468
Homeland Security.,4513.175,0.701
Dr. Swan.,4513.876,1.301
The Press.,4515.177,0.901
Thank you.,4516.078,1.368
Is the White House going to keep its promise to,4517.446,2.669
"withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, and our",4520.115,2.536
understanding is that there are some divisions,4522.651,4.571
of opinion.,4527.222,0.434
Rex Tillerson wants to stay in.,4527.656,1.902
Steve Bannon wants to get out.,4529.558,1.935
What&amp;#39;s going on?,4531.493,0.968
Will you keep the promise?,4532.461,1.067
"If not, why not?",4533.528,1.302
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, I think that&amp;#39;s something I&amp;#39;d be",4534.83,1.034
glad to follow up with you and everyone.,4535.864,1.568
I don&amp;#39;t have anything on that right now.,4537.432,2.303
I&amp;#39;m aware of the discussion of the,4539.735,1.268
(inaudible).,4541.003,0.767
"If I can, I&amp;#39;ll get back to you.",4541.77,1.201
Mike.,4542.971,0.367
"The Press: I have an unrelated question, but I",4543.338,2.036
also want to follow up on something Alexis --,4545.374,1.701
Mr. Spicer: Unrelated questions are my favorite.,4547.075,0.935
(laughter),4548.01,1.134
The Press: -- had asked.,4549.144,0.534
She talked about the communications strategy.,4549.678,2.402
Will The President play a public role in,4552.08,2.837
selling this bill?,4554.917,1.034
Will he speak to the public about it?,4555.951,1.335
Will he answer questions about it?,4557.286,1.201
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s a good question.,4558.487,2.269
I think that we are going to have a very,4560.756,1.434
comprehensive strategy.,4562.19,1.068
"As I mentioned, just a few minutes from now, the",4563.258,2.269
President is going to engage with members of the,4565.527,3.203
House Whip team to talk to them.,4568.73,3.27
I understand that.,4572,0.935
"But I know, and I understand that.",4572.935,2.869
This is step one Mike.,4575.804,1.135
There&amp;#39;s a lot of time.,4576.939,1.101
"As I mentioned, we expect to be dealing with this",4578.04,2.035
for the next several weeks.,4580.075,1.468
There will be plenty of opportunities for The,4581.543,0.968
"President to speak about that, to engage with the",4582.511,2.102
