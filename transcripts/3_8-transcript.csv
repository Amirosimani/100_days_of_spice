Mr. Spicer: Good morning.,1.601,1.034
"First off, I want to acknowledge, as the",2.635,1.836
"President did this morning, that today is",4.471,1.768
International Women&amp;#39;s Day.,6.239,1.535
It&amp;#39;s also Women&amp;#39;s History Month.,7.774,1.468
We&amp;#39;re going to be holding several events throughout,9.242,2.436
the month here at the White House to honor and,11.678,2.135
celebrate women and how their vital contributions,13.813,2.736
"have and continue to be to our society, our economy,",16.549,3.704
our family and our businesses.,20.253,1.668
The President tweeted this morning about the surge in,21.921,1.902
hiring in the two months that he&amp;#39;s been in office.,23.823,3.17
LinkedIn&amp;#39;s workforce reports say January and,26.993,2.369
February were the strongest consecutive,29.362,1.602
months for hiring in over a year and a half.,30.964,2.869
A new report from ADP and Moody&amp;#39;s showed strong,33.833,3.237
private job growth that is far exceeding,37.07,2.169
market expectations.,39.239,1.568
"And just this morning, Samsung confirmed that",40.807,2.169
it&amp;#39;s planning a &amp;quot;major investment&amp;quot; in U.S.,42.976,2.602
"production facilities, directly citing the",45.578,2.136
President&amp;#39;s election as an influence in,47.714,1.635
their decision.,49.349,1.201
The initial investment is expected to reach,50.55,1.835
around $300 million.,52.385,2.636
We keep seeing that the wave of optimism in growth,55.021,2.536
in the wake of the President&amp;#39;s pledges to,57.557,2.035
help American businesses continues to produce real,59.592,2.736
results for people throughout our nation.,62.328,2.203
Yesterday I forgot to -- there are a couple of,64.531,4.07
"things that I didn&amp;#39;t get to yesterday, so let me",68.601,1.502
mention a couple of those.,70.103,2.002
"Yesterday afternoon, the Secretary of Veterans",72.105,1.568
"Affairs, Dr. David Shulkin, and senior White",73.673,2.636
House staff met with several veteran service,76.309,2.436
organizations -- included in what is commonly,78.745,2.202
referred to as the Big Six -- to discuss the,80.947,2.87
President&amp;#39;s commitment to helping our veterans and,83.817,2.502
modernizing our VA.,86.319,1.335
The meeting represented another step in fulfilling,87.654,2.669
the President&amp;#39;s promise to the men and women who have,90.323,2.836
served our nation so honorably.,93.159,2.036
I know the President looks forward to personally,95.195,2.002
following up on that meeting with the VSOs.,97.197,3.37
"Also last night, the President named several",100.567,2.002
individuals whom he intends to nominate or,102.569,2.202
appoint to key administration posts:,104.771,2.002
"Courtney Simmons Elwood, General Counsel of the",106.773,2.602
"Central Intelligence Agency; Noel Francisco,",109.375,2.97
Solicitor General at the Department of Justice;,112.345,2.169
"Jeffrey Rosen, Deputy Secretary of",114.514,2.836
Transportation; John J.,117.35,1.869
"Sullivan, General Counsel for the Department of",119.219,2.435
"Defense; Ajit Pai, member of the Federal",121.654,2.703
"Communications Commission; and Tony Sayegh, Jr., the",124.357,3.17
Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs at the,127.527,2.703
Department of Treasury.,130.23,0.867
Expect further announcements as the,131.097,2.403
week goes on.,133.5,1.234
"Now, on to the events of the day.",134.734,1.502
"This morning, after receiving his daily",136.236,2.068
"intelligence briefing, the President met with Laurene",138.304,2.469
"Powell Jobs, the founder and president of Emerson",140.773,2.77
"Collective, an organization dedicated to",143.543,2.436
removing the barriers that unfortunately prevent some,145.979,2.469
in the world from achieving their,148.448,1.601
full potential.,150.049,1.335
"They discussed education and immigration policy,",151.384,2.703
which are two of the areas that,154.087,1.334
Emerson Collective focuses on.,155.421,2.503
"Then the President held a strategic affairs lunch,",157.924,2.035
focused on infrastructure with leaders in,159.959,2.503
the private sector.,162.462,1.234
Infrastructure used to be a point of American pride.,163.696,2.77
"But now, an overbearing, ineffective regular system",166.466,3.37
can keep projects in limbo for years.,169.836,2.836
The President has already started removing the,172.672,1.969
regulatory roadblocks that have been killing projects,174.641,2.669
before they&amp;#39;ve even begun through his executive,177.31,2.302
"actions, streamlining the permitting process and",179.612,2.636
calling for each agency throughout the government,182.248,2.803
to identify regulations that cause undue burden.,185.051,3.303
"As the President has said many times, strong",188.354,2.369
public-private partnerships will also be,190.723,1.936
"key to revitalizing our country&amp;#39;s ruined roads,",192.659,3.336
crumbling bridges and outdated airports.,195.995,3.17
The government has wasted too much of the taxpayers&amp;#39;,199.165,2.236
money on inefficient and misguided projects.,201.401,3.37
By looking at infrastructure from a,204.771,1.501
"businessperson&amp;#39;s perspective, as the",206.272,2.002
"President and these executives do, we can",208.274,2.569
restore respect for the taxpayer dollar and make,210.843,3.07
the best investment.,213.913,1.702
The President was particularly pleased to be,215.615,1.601
holding this meeting now that Secretary of,217.216,1.502
"Transportation Chao, EPA Administrator Pruitt, and",218.718,3.337
Energy Secretary Perry are all confirmed and,222.055,2.402
getting to work.,224.457,1.235
"In attendance at the lunch, as I mentioned,",225.692,1.835
"were Secretary Chao, Secretary Perry,",227.527,2.502
"Administrator Pruitt, and then Richard LeFrak, CEO",230.029,3.17

"the Nature Conservancy; Tyler Duvall, the partner",245.578,2.736
of McKinsey; and Elon Musk of SpaceX.,248.314,3.304
"Later this afternoon, the President will meet with",251.618,1.735
Congressman Elijah Cummings to discuss rising,253.353,2.469
prescription drugs prices.,255.822,2.135
I know the President is looking forward to,257.957,1.368
continuing the dialogue that they started a few,259.325,1.835
weeks ago on the phone.,261.16,1.502
"At 4:00 o&amp;#39;clock, the President will meet with",262.662,5.372
"Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, Senator Murkowski,",268.034,1.101
and Senator Sullivan of Alaska.,269.135,0.767
They&amp;#39;re expected to discuss the priorities of,269.902,1.469
"the Department of Interior, especially as it",271.371,2.902
pertains to the government-owned,274.273,1.369
lands in Alaska.,275.642,2.002
"This evening, the President will meet with",277.644,1.368
conservative leaders about health care.,279.012,2.002
We&amp;#39;ll have more details and participants on that,281.014,2.068
meeting a little bit later this afternoon.,283.082,2.303
The President and the Vice President continue to,285.385,1.568
reiterate their support for the House bill on,286.953,2.836
"Obamacare repeal and replace, and look forward",289.789,2.502
to working with Congress to institute a new,292.291,2.636
healthcare system.,294.927,1.302
"Tonight, the President will have dinner with",296.229,1.334
Senator and Mrs. Cruz.,297.563,1.469
"And finally, a couple of additional administration",299.032,2.202
announcements.,301.234,1.201
"Today, the President and the First Lady announced",302.435,2.269
the initial details for the 139th White House,304.704,3.537
"Easter Egg Roll taking place on Monday,",308.241,2.502
April 17th.,310.743,1.402
They are honored to continue the traditions of,312.145,1.701
the past while creating new ones that will play a,313.846,2.269
lasting role in the fabric of our nation&amp;#39;s history.,316.115,2.97
Tickets to the Easter Egg Roll are free to the,319.085,1.802
public and will be allotted through an,320.887,1.334
online lottery.,322.221,1.268
Further details on the lottery and information on,323.489,2.736
that day will be released later this month.,326.225,2.436
Keep an eye on WhiteHouse.gov for,328.661,1.735
updates on that.,330.396,1.302
I&amp;#39;m also pleased to announce -- and a little,331.698,2.435
bit proud -- that Taoiseach Kenny of Ireland,334.133,3.003
will be visiting the White House for the traditional,337.136,1.735
St. Patrick&amp;#39;s Day visit on March 16th.,338.871,2.603
"We&amp;#39;ll have further details on that visit, as well as",341.474,2.135
the other foreign leader visits later this week.,343.609,2.57
"With that, some questions.",346.179,1.835
David Smith of The Guardian.,348.014,2.836
"The Press: Hi, Sean.",350.85,1.001
Can I ask about the President&amp;#39;s state,351.851,2.703
visit to the UK?,354.554,1.902
Is there timing for that?,356.456,1.301
And what was your reaction to some members of,357.757,3.37
Parliament in Britain saying the President is,361.127,2.569
not welcome?,363.696,1.468
They actually used words like &amp;quot;racist&amp;quot; and,365.164,2.136
&amp;quot;sexist.&amp;quot; Has that led him to reconsider?,367.3,3.67
"Mr. Spicer: The President, as you know, accepted Her",370.97,3.103
Majesty&amp;#39;s invitation when,374.073,2.002
the Prime Minister was here.,376.075,1.201
He looks forward to going over and visiting the,377.276,3.904
United Kingdom.,381.18,1.268
"As we have details to share with you further, we",382.448,3.037
"will, but there is nothing further at this time. Caitlin.",385.485,3.203
The Press: Does the White House have a reaction to,388.688,2.836
the Iranian vessels coming within 150 yards of a Navy,391.524,2.569
ship over the weekend?,394.093,1.168
Aren&amp;#39;t they on notice?,395.261,2.102
And will you offer anything beyond a,397.363,1.435
verbal reaction?,398.798,0.901
And then I have a follow-up question.,399.699,1.301
Mr. Spicer: Okay.,401,1.335
The USNS ship that was in close proximity is,402.335,3.136
obviously something that the President has been,405.471,1.535
made aware of.,407.006,1.702
The President has been very clear that this,408.708,1.535
provocative action is something that,410.243,1.968
won&amp;#39;t be tolerated.,412.211,1.702
"With that, I would refer you to the Department of",413.913,1.902
"Defense, who is monitoring that situation and will",415.815,4.037
talk about the appropriate actions they may take.,419.852,1.869
And your next one?,421.721,0.667
"The Press: And then, secondly, does he have any",422.388,1.835
plans to revamp the H-1B visa program by the,424.223,2.336
April 1 deadline?,426.559,2.769
Mr. Spicer: I think we&amp;#39;ve talked before about,429.328,1.268
immigration as a whole.,430.596,0.568
I think there is the legal part of immigration and,431.164,2.969
then the illegal part of immigration.,434.133,1.602
The President&amp;#39;s actions that he&amp;#39;s taken in terms,435.735,2.736
of his executive order and other revamping of,438.471,3.103
immigration policy have focused on our border,441.574,2.402
"security, keeping our country safe,",443.976,1.669
our people safe.,445.645,1.768
"And then, obviously, whether it&amp;#39;s H-1B visas or",447.413,2.97
the other one -- spousal visas -- other areas of,450.383,3.47
"student visas, I think there is a natural desire",453.853,3.27
to have a full look at --,457.123,1.168
a comprehensive look at that.,458.291,1.434
He discussed the RAYS Act yesterday with Senators,459.725,3.404
Perdue and Cotton.,463.129,2.035
We&amp;#39;ll have more on that coming forward.,465.164,1.935
"But I think as the readout mentioned, he was very",467.099,2.636
supportive of their efforts with respect to,469.735,2.636
how we view legal immigration.,472.371,1.969
He mentioned it in his joint address that we&amp;#39;re,474.34,1.668
one of only a handful of countries that doesn&amp;#39;t use,476.008,2.436
"a merit-based system of immigration, and that is",478.444,2.669
something that we need to look at in its totality. Hunter.,481.113,3.437
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",484.55,0.934
I had two quick questions.,485.484,1.969
Are you aware of any women who work at the White,487.453,3.504
House who are participating in the,490.957,1.735
strikes today?,492.692,1.034
"And also, more generally, what is the",493.726,2.569
administration&amp;#39;s reaction to this protest?,496.295,2.703
And do you think it&amp;#39;s an effective way -- skipping,498.998,2.202
work is an effective way for women to demonstrate,501.2,2.202
their power and significance?,503.402,1.502
"Mr. Spicer: On the first part, I am not aware of",504.904,3.136
any that are not here.,508.04,2.436
I think everyone that I&amp;#39;m aware of has shown up and,510.476,4.638
is working really hard to advance the,515.114,1.168
President&amp;#39;s agenda.,516.282,1.702
They&amp;#39;re committed to moving this,517.984,1.368
country forward.,519.352,0.8
For those of us who have joined the President,520.152,2.803
"throughout government, I think -- but obviously, as",522.955,3.337
"the President stated today, we want to",526.292,2.135
recognize the contributions that women,528.427,1.669
"make to our businesses, to our families, to our",530.096,2.369
"economy, to our society.",532.465,2.469
And it&amp;#39;s a free country.,534.934,1.301
People have the right to express themselves.,536.235,2.169
"But I think that we should, on a daily basis",538.404,2.002
-- not just one day a year but 365 days a year --,540.406,4.004
appreciate the contributions that women,544.41,1.335
make in all of those categories.,545.745,1.368
"So it shouldn&amp;#39;t be a daily thing, and hopefully we",547.113,3.303
can help fix that a little bit more.,550.416,1.368
"The Press: Thanks a lot, Sean.",551.784,1.902
There seems to be this groundswell of,553.686,2.202
conservative opposition to the healthcare bill that,555.888,3.27
was offered up by leadership in the,559.158,2.603
House of Representatives.,561.761,1.735
You mentioned the President is going to be,563.496,1.368
meeting this evening with conservatives.,564.864,1.768
What is his message to those individuals?,566.632,2.603
Are they members of the Freedom Caucus?,569.235,2.469
Will Senator Rand Paul be there?,571.704,2.402
And can you give a sense about what the President,574.106,2.236
intends to do to turn around that opposition,576.342,3.003
that was quite apparent yesterday?,579.345,2.169
Mr. Spicer: So a few things on that.,581.514,2.035
"One, as I mentioned, we&amp;#39;ll have a list of",583.549,1.568
participants later.,585.117,1.936
"Two, I think that there has been a lot of -- from",587.053,3.37
business and conservative groups have been very,590.423,3.637
"supportive of this, whether it&amp;#39;s Americans for",594.06,1.434
"Tax Reform, Americans&amp;#39; Taxpayers Union, the",595.494,2.369
"Medical Device Manufacturing Association,",597.863,1.969
the U.S.,599.832,0.667
"Chamber of Commerce, AdvaMed, One Nation",600.499,2.536
"Health, Consumer Health Products Association, the",603.035,2.569
"Association of -- AMAC, the National Association",605.604,3.237
"of Wholesale Distributors, the American Legislative",608.841,3.403
"Exchange Council, and others.",612.244,1.469
There&amp;#39;s been tremendous support for this.,613.713,2.102
"We&amp;#39;ve had people throughout Washington, D.C",615.815,2.602
going to different associations and groups,618.417,1.835
throughout the day the last couple days talking,620.252,2.203
about the benefits of this.,622.455,0.901
And we&amp;#39;re going to continue to do outreach.,623.356,2.769
"He met, as you know, yesterday with the House",626.125,1.768
Whip team expressing his unwavering support for the,627.893,3.604
bill and the process that it&amp;#39;s about to encounter.,631.497,1.902
He&amp;#39;ll mention -- he&amp;#39;ll work with these,633.399,1.902
individuals tonight.,635.301,1.268
And we&amp;#39;re going to have a full-court press.,636.569,2.202
Our team throughout the administration on local,638.771,2.903
radio and local television to get that message right,641.674,3.136
to the American people to talk about both the things,644.81,3.003
that we talked about yesterday -- why we have a,647.813,1.902
crisis right now in healthcare and why,649.715,1.602
"Obamacare is failing, but then secondly why the",651.317,3.537
solution that the President has worked on,654.854,1.468
with the House is the right one to bring down,656.322,1.601
costs and to reinstitute choice.,657.923,2.069
So that message is going to continue to get,659.992,2.369
delivered both today and for the next several weeks,662.361,3.57
until it passes the House and the Senate and comes,665.931,2.069
back to his desk.,668,1.135
"But again, one of the important messages that I",669.135,2.569
think those on the conservative side need to,671.704,2.536
"understand is, right now, there is an",674.24,4.738
uneven playing field.,678.978,1.201
"If you get your insurance through Medicaid,",680.179,3.337
"Medicare, through the government, or an",683.516,1.902
"employer-based healthcare, you are untaxed, your",685.418,2.636
employer is untaxed.,688.054,1.201
"It is those self-employed individuals, those small",689.255,3.103
businesses that are paying the penalty for this.,692.358,2.302
"And that&amp;#39;s what I think we have to remember, is that",694.66,1.969
we talk so often on the conservative side and on,696.629,2.836
the Republican side about the importance of,699.465,1.902
"entrepreneurship, the importance of small",701.367,2.135
"businesses to our economy, and yet they&amp;#39;re the ones",703.502,2.469
who suffer right now with an inequity in,705.971,2.67
the tax system.,708.641,0.934
And I think that by leveling that playing,709.575,1.668
"field, and by giving them more options and driving",711.243,2.403
"down cost, we&amp;#39;re actually doing a very conservative",713.646,3.336
thing here by removing the mandate of a,716.982,3.137
government-mandated &amp;quot;you must buy this program or,720.119,3.704
"you will pay a penalty,&amp;quot; and eliminating choice.",723.823,3.003
We are enacting I think very strong conservative,726.826,2.669
values in healthcare that give all Americans more,729.495,3.604
choice at a lower cost.,733.099,1.234
So I think that should be a very positive message. John.,734.333,3.203
"The Press: Yes, thank you.",737.536,1.635
As a brand new federal employee I&amp;#39;m,739.171,2.269
sure you&amp;#39;re aware --,741.44,0.668
Mr. Spicer: current -- welcome back.,742.108,1.634
"The Press: Yes, well, at the moment.",743.742,2.002
I&amp;#39;m sure you and your family are aware that,745.744,1.869
Office of Personnel Management offers a very,747.613,2.302
comprehensive healthcare program called the Federal,749.915,3.204
Employee Health Benefit Program.,753.119,1.034
Mr. Spicer: Yes.,754.153,0.801
"The Press: You, anyone in this building, on the",754.954,1.535
"Hill, their staff, their family, their friends --",756.489,1.868
"not their friends, their family -- well, maybe who",758.357,3.07
knows -- very generous.,761.427,1.201
It&amp;#39;s state of the art.,762.628,2.069
The individuals involved in the healthcare,764.697,3.103
"situation right now, the debate, no matter how it",767.8,3.503
"plays out, can they really have the kind of sympathy",771.303,3.571
and empathy for individuals who may not,774.874,1.701
benefit nearly as much when they&amp;#39;re negotiating,776.575,2.703
"this -- all these plans, Sean?",779.278,3.737
Mr. Spicer: In what respect?,783.015,1.101
"The Press: Well, I mean, you&amp;#39;re fine.",784.116,0.901
You&amp;#39;re covered.,785.017,1.068
"Mr. Spicer: Sure, but it&amp;#39;s unfortunate -- first of",786.085,2.235
"all, I&amp;#39;m not fine.",788.32,1.302
"Because I think because of Obamacare, premiums on",789.622,2.035
everybody have gone up.,791.657,2.035
"Regardless of what you pay, federal employees",793.692,3.137
make a contribution to their,796.829,0.834
healthcare plan as well.,797.663,1.568
And I think that the -- all premiums have,799.231,1.902
increased over the last -- whether you&amp;#39;re in an,801.133,1.835
employer-based system or not.,802.968,1.936
So one of the big issues with Obamacare was in,804.904,4.237
order to fix a problem that faced 15 to 20,809.141,3.037
"million people, is that the entire system got",812.178,2.836
"shattered, and prices on",815.014,2.002
everybody got ratcheted up.,817.016,1.535
People who were on Medicaid suddenly lost,818.551,2.135
"their ability -- so the issue was, is that in an",820.686,2.369
attempt to solve a problem that affected a very,823.055,3.103
"specified and defined group of people, we",826.158,2.503
affected the entire healthcare market.,828.661,3.003
So whether or not you get it from an employee or not,831.664,2.502
"-- an employer or not -- but to your question,",834.166,2.436
that&amp;#39;s part of the issue.,836.602,1.234
The Press: But --,837.836,1.068
"Mr. Spicer: Hold on, hold on.",838.904,0.567
"Here&amp;#39;s the issue -- you&amp;#39;re right, you&amp;#39;re",839.471,0.735
absolutely right.,840.206,0.633
"Right now, if you&amp;#39;re a federal employee, and a",840.839,2.87
"lot of cases in state, you get to open a book and you",843.709,1.435
"get to look at what plan matters to you, what plan",845.144,3.203
is best for you or your family -- how much do you,848.347,2.87
"want to pay, how much coverage do you want to",851.217,1.468
"have, what&amp;#39;s the co-pay you&amp;#39;re willing to -- what",852.685,2.002
services or benefits do you want as,854.687,2.035
part of your plan. Absolutely.,856.722,2.336
"But the issue is, for so many Americans, they don&amp;#39;t",859.058,1.468
have that choice.,860.526,1.234
"For a third of the counties in this country,",861.76,2.536
"they&amp;#39;ve got one choice, one.",864.296,2.937
"And in a lot of states they&amp;#39;ve got none, or the",867.233,1.701
"exchanges are becoming fewer and fewer, the",868.934,2.303
"number of doctors and plans that take Medicaid,",871.237,2.702
fewer and fewer.,873.939,1.168
"So to your point, I think actually we&amp;#39;re in a unique",875.107,2.936
"place, because we get to understand what the",878.043,2.469
average American should get -- that we shouldn&amp;#39;t,880.512,2.103
be limited to a specified number of people.,882.615,1.801
The Press: I appreciate your argument.,884.416,2.469
Very well taken.,886.885,0.668
Mr. Spicer: Thank you.,887.553,0.534
"The Press: However, I&amp;#39;m going to compare a GS-5 or",888.087,2.269
a GS-9 to a senator or a secretary of one,890.356,3.069
of the agencies.,893.425,1.035
I mean the safety net on those individuals gives,894.46,2.702
"them a certain cushion, then they&amp;#39;re negotiating.",897.162,2.503
But do they really have that kind of compassion or,899.665,2.936
"that kind of empathy for the people who, in fact,",902.601,1.902
may be thrown off the healthcare?,904.503,1.869
Mr. Spicer: I think that just because somebody has,906.372,2.269
healthcare doesn&amp;#39;t mean that they can&amp;#39;t empathize,908.641,2.268
with somebody who doesn&amp;#39;t.,910.909,2.303
We all have family and friends,913.212,2.002
that are suffering.,915.214,0.667
"I mean, that&amp;#39;s like saying because I have a job I",915.881,1.535
can&amp;#39;t be empathetic to somebody who,917.416,1.168
doesn&amp;#39;t have a job.,918.584,1.902
We all have family or friends.,920.486,1.001
It&amp;#39;s the same thing when we watch a friend or a,921.487,2.169
family member suffer through a terminal,923.656,1.334
"disease, because we have suffered through it",924.99,2.036
doesn&amp;#39;t mean that we can&amp;#39;t have compassion towards,927.026,2.435
that person or be concerned on how much that,929.461,3.804
bill is costing them.,933.265,1.001
"I mean, that&amp;#39;s actually in some ways -- depending on",934.266,5.406
the relationship you have with that person -- you,939.672,2.135
can even feel worse.,941.807,0.901
You can feel guilty about how much you have and how,942.708,2.536
you&amp;#39;re not able to help that person.,945.244,1.701
I think in many cases that&amp;#39;s what drives us is,946.945,2.503
to know that there are options available to some,949.448,1.702
Americans and not others.,951.15,1.268
The Press: I appreciate your response.,952.418,0.934
Mr. Spicer: Thank you. John.,953.352,2.669
"The Press: Sean, will you confirm that there is a",956.021,0.901
criminal investigation into this alleged theft of,956.922,6.106
cyber tools from the CIA by WikiLeaks?,963.028,4.371
What can the White House tell us about the,967.399,2.603
"situation, particularly the fact that it seems",970.002,1.702
like there&amp;#39;s another leak for the intelligence,971.704,3.069
community that&amp;#39;s on the scale of Edward Snowden?,974.773,3.47
And can you assure the American people that none,978.243,2.103
of these tools have ever been used against them?,980.346,2.469
"Mr. Spicer: Well, there&amp;#39;s a couple things in that.",982.815,2.202
"Number one, for obvious reasons it is our policy",985.017,3.17
as a government not to confirm the authenticity,988.187,3.503
of any kind of disclosure or hack.,991.69,2.202
That would be highly inappropriate for us.,993.892,3.537
But all of these occurred under the last,997.429,3.27
administration -- that is important.,1000.699,1.702
All of these alleged issues.,1002.401,3.27
And I think it&amp;#39;s interesting to have it,1005.671,2.069
asked this way about the damage that could have,1007.74,3.203
occurred or what tools could be used in light of,1010.943,2.302
what&amp;#39;s been going on recently.,1013.245,1.368
We&amp;#39;ve had your own network&amp;#39;s correspondent,1014.613,2.77
James Rosen had his phones -- multiple phones tapped.,1017.383,6.239
Was that appropriate back then?,1023.622,1.735
I think there&amp;#39;s a lot of concern out there about,1025.357,2.069
alleged leaks.,1027.426,0.934
There&amp;#39;s two steps to this.,1028.36,2.002
And I think what you saw over the last week in,1032.097,3.971
terms of -- this should be a major concern to people,1036.068,2.836
in terms of the leaks that are coming out and the,1038.904,2.102
desire to get to the bottom of them -- whether,1041.006,1.769
or not -- not specifically with respect to the,1042.775,3.97
"disclosure that you&amp;#39;re referring to, but I think",1046.745,2.469
the idea that we are having these ongoing,1049.214,2.97
disclosures of national security and classified,1052.184,2.269
information should be something that everybody,1054.453,2.97
is outraged by in this country.,1057.423,1.267
This is the kind of disclosure that undermines,1058.69,2.303
"our country, our security, and our well-being.",1060.993,2.903
"And you&amp;#39;ve seen over the last two years, depending",1063.896,4.371
"on the leak, it depends on the outrage.",1068.267,2.302
It&amp;#39;s interesting how whenever -- whether the,1070.569,2.903
"leak occurred under the last administration, you",1073.472,2.502
had member after member talking about disclosures,1075.974,4.705
"that occurred during that last administration,",1080.679,3.37
whether it was members of Congress -- Elijah,1084.049,2.102
Cummings expressed concern during the last thing --,1086.151,3.037
last administration in terms of the Americans,1089.188,3.036
"that were -- when it dealt with Hillary Clinton,",1092.224,2.336
there was complete outrage about the leaks that,1094.56,2.369
occurred; members calling for investigations,1096.929,1.801
to the leaks.,1098.73,1.569
It&amp;#39;s interesting how there is sort of a double,1100.299,1.601
"standard with when the leaks occur, how much",1101.9,2.303
outrage there is.,1104.203,1.401
And so I do think it&amp;#39;s important.,1105.604,1.902
While I don&amp;#39;t want to get into confirming or denying,1107.506,2.269
"this particular thing, I think it is interesting",1109.775,2.135
how different subjects are approached.,1114.046,2.369
"This one everyone is immediately rushing to,",1116.415,2.402
and there should be a lot more coverage of this.,1118.817,1.669
This alleged leak should concern every single,1120.486,3.536
American in terms of the impact it has on our,1124.022,2.002
national security.,1126.024,1.402
The Press: Can I ask something unrelated?,1127.426,1.568
"Mr. Spicer: Of course, you can.",1128.994,1.101
The Press: Robin Shahini has been imprisoned in,1130.095,2.102
Iran since last October for collaborating with a,1132.197,3.103
hostile government -- that government being the,1135.3,2.403
United States of America.,1137.703,1.635
"He&amp;#39;s on a hunger strike, apparently his",1139.338,1.434
health is suffering.,1140.772,1.335
Is the President aware of Mr. Shahini&amp;#39;s plight and,1142.107,3.036
that of three other Americans who are,1145.143,1.335
being held in Iran?,1146.478,1.101
"And what, if anything, might the President be",1147.579,3.103
doing about it?,1150.682,0.434
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, so obviously we&amp;#39;re",1151.116,0.768
aware of the situation.,1151.884,1.901
"In that particular case, I would refer you to the",1153.785,1.268
State Department.,1155.053,0.701
The Press: I wanted to go back to an,1155.754,1.568
earlier question.,1157.322,1.435
What is the President personally going to be,1158.757,1.502
doing in order to sell this healthcare bill?,1160.259,2.168
And what&amp;#39;s he going to do to convince reticent,1162.427,1.502
"lawmakers to come along -- people like Rand Paul, who",1163.929,2.169
don&amp;#39;t like it?,1166.098,1.802
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I mean, we&amp;#39;re on day two.",1167.9,2.869
"As I mentioned, we&amp;#39;ve been out and local -- talk",1170.769,3.07
radio and local markets.,1173.839,2.335
The President yesterday met with the,1176.174,1.502
House deputy whips.,1177.676,1.134
"Today, he&amp;#39;s having a series of additional",1178.81,2.436
"meetings with conservative groups, with others.",1181.246,2.936
He&amp;#39;s already talked to insurance agents.,1184.182,1.302
"I mean, we&amp;#39;ve talked about the lead up to this with",1185.484,2.202
"the insurance executives, with companies, with",1187.686,2.169
various members of the House and the Senate,1189.855,1.702
from both parties.,1191.557,0.8
"He met with governors, attorneys general, I think",1192.357,2.336
there&amp;#39;s a group of lieutenant,1194.693,0.934
governors coming in.,1195.627,2.002
We&amp;#39;re going to be aggressively going after,1197.629,4.571
-- talking about the solution that we have for,1202.2,2.136
"healthcare, both the need to repeal the current",1204.336,3.837
Obamacare system and the need to replace it with,1208.173,2.369
something that gives patients the choices and,1210.542,3.337
costs that they need.,1213.879,1.134
"As I mentioned yesterday, and I can&amp;#39;t overstate",1215.013,2.269
"this, there&amp;#39;s a difference between having a",1217.282,1.335
card and having care.,1218.617,2.269
Being told you have coverage and not being,1220.886,2.135
"able to use it is no good, and that&amp;#39;s the thing that",1223.021,3.404
I think is really important.,1226.425,2.002
"When we get asked the question, so often, how",1229.962,2.002
"many people are going to be covered, that&amp;#39;s not the",1231.964,2.535
question that should be asked -- how many people,1234.499,1.368
are going to get the care they need?,1235.867,1.469
"Having coverage with a high deductible and, in",1237.336,4.17
some cases -- or not having a plan that allows,1241.506,2.002
"you to get the coverage you need or afford it,",1243.508,3.737
isn&amp;#39;t real coverage.,1247.245,1.268
It&amp;#39;s a card.,1248.513,1.235
And I think that&amp;#39;s the big difference in the approach,1249.748,1.835
that we&amp;#39;re taking here.,1251.583,0.667
It&amp;#39;s how do we get people the affordable care they,1252.25,3.204
need; that there&amp;#39;s more choice; that more doctors,1255.454,2.269
are coming into the system instead of leaving.,1257.723,1.968
"And that is a big, big difference in the approach",1259.691,2.169
that&amp;#39;s happening now.,1261.86,1.201
The Press: Will he be going on the road to try,1263.061,0.801
to sell it?,1263.862,0.801
Mr. Spicer: I think you will see a lot of travel,1264.663,1.401
and a lot of activity by the President and all of,1266.064,2.836
the administration.,1268.9,1.001
And it&amp;#39;s not just going to be the President.,1269.901,1.335
"It&amp;#39;s going to be the secretary, the directors,",1271.236,2.403
key administration staff.,1273.639,1.835
The Vice President has been actively engaged in,1275.474,2.802
"meeting on the Hill, on talk radio, on local",1278.276,3.571
"radio, on local television.",1281.847,1.868
You&amp;#39;ve seen a flurry of meetings with outside,1283.715,2.87
"interests, with op-eds explaining the problem and",1286.585,3.437
engaging groups and associations that have an,1290.022,5.038
"interest in this, and industry leaders.",1295.06,3.236
"But this is going to be a very, very aggressive,",1298.296,2.203
comprehensive approach to making sure that every,1300.499,2.569
American understands that there is a major problem,1303.068,3.57
and that we are here to fix it. Cecilia.,1306.638,2.836
"The Press: Just on WikiLeaks, I want to go",1309.474,0.901
back to that -- two parts.,1310.375,0.834
Is the President outraged by this?,1311.209,2.336
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I mean, again, I don&amp;#39;t want to --",1313.545,4.004
the allegations -- he has been very clear about the,1317.549,2.903
concern that he has for leaks. This is --,1320.452,2.636
The Press: This one specifically --,1323.088,0.867
"Mr. Spicer: Well, again, Cecilia, if I -- I think",1323.955,2.103
he is very concerned about the allegations that are,1326.058,3.103
out there in terms of what may or may not happen.,1329.161,2.536
"It is an allegation, it is something that we are not",1331.697,2.902
going to confirm at this time.,1334.599,1.769
But as you can imagine from the President&amp;#39;s,1336.368,1.668
"previous comments, he is extremely concerned about",1338.036,2.369
"this, about these allegations, about this --",1340.405,3.037
about the potential that something -- if this were,1343.442,4.337
true -- would have on our national security.,1348.547,2.035
"And make no mistake about it, I think the President",1350.582,2.269
has talked before that anybody who leaks,1352.851,2.336
classified information will be held to the,1355.187,2.302
highest degree of law.,1357.489,1.235
We will go after people,1358.724,1.001
who leak classified information.,1359.725,1.401
We will prosecute them to,1361.126,1.301
the full extent of the law.,1362.427,2.069
Playing with our nation&amp;#39;s national security is not,1364.496,2.369
something that should be taken lightly under,1366.865,1.535
this administration.,1368.4,0.767
The Press: Quick follow-up.,1369.167,0.568
When it came to the campaign and Hillary,1369.735,2.902
"Clinton, the President said, &amp;quot;I love WikiLeaks.&amp;quot;",1372.637,2.77
Does he still feel that way today?,1375.407,1.501
Mr. Spicer: There is a big difference between,1376.908,2.336
disclosing Podesta -- John Podesta&amp;#39;s gmail accounts,1379.244,4.204
"about a back and forth, and his undermining of",1383.448,1.869
"Hillary Clinton, and his thoughts on her on a",1385.317,2.736
"personal nature, and the",1388.053,1.268
leaking of classified information.,1389.321,1.535
"There is a massive, massive difference between",1390.856,2.569
those two things.,1393.425,1.401
"And I think it is, again, the interest and the",1394.826,2.469
outrage that occurred last year by a lot of Democrats,1397.295,3.904
when it came to leaks is interesting that we&amp;#39;re,1401.666,1.802
hearing not as much outrage now when it comes,1403.468,2.603
to some of our issues of national security. April.,1406.071,3.103
"The Press: Sean, a couple questions.",1409.174,2.035
"One, you said Congressman Cummings -- you affirmed",1411.209,3.37
Congressman Cummings is meeting with President,1414.579,2.303
Trump today.,1416.882,1.134
Mr. Spicer: Yes.,1418.016,1.101
"The Press: In the last press conference, his solo",1419.117,1.535
"press conference the President had, he talked",1420.652,1.568
about Senator Schumer telling Elijah Cummings,1422.22,3.504
not to come.,1425.724,1.001
What happened to smooth this over?,1426.725,2.169
And what is the conversation going,1428.894,1.334
to be about?,1430.228,0.968
Is it just going to solely be on the high cost of,1431.196,2.402
prescription drugs?,1433.598,1.068
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think that the nature of the",1434.666,3.203
meeting stems from the conversation they had on,1437.869,1.835
"the phone, which was on prescription drugs.",1439.704,3.504
And then I&amp;#39;m sure that if Congressman Cummings or,1443.208,5.205
"the President brings up another subject,",1448.413,1.602
it will go there.,1450.015,0.867
I&amp;#39;m not -- we&amp;#39;ll try to have some sort of readout,1450.882,1.969
"afterwards, depending on how that goes.",1452.851,4.304
But the nature of it is an area where they agree.,1457.155,2.202
"And if you remember, one of the things that they",1459.357,1.435
talked about on the phone was that there were,1460.792,2.403
probably several more areas that they would,1463.195,2.869
"agree on, and find that they would agree on,",1466.064,3.237
throughout a conversation.,1469.301,1.001
And I hope that that conversation does exactly,1470.302,2.903
what they said that it would in terms of getting,1473.205,4.471
to those areas of common agreement where they can,1477.676,2.002
work together to help solve additional problems,1479.678,2.068
that our country faces.,1481.746,1.035
The Press: So you don&amp;#39;t have any knowledge of what,1482.781,3.17
happened to smooth that over for him to come in --,1485.951,2.102
Mr. Spicer: I know our teams were in touch with,1488.053,1.468
-- his office immediately followed.,1489.521,2.302
"And as you know, there were a couple times when",1491.823,2.102
the meetings had been -- tried to be scheduled and,1493.925,2.569
just didn&amp;#39;t work out.,1496.494,0.868
"And luckily, he was able to -- The Press: He&amp;#39;s one",1497.362,2.97
member of the 49 of the CBC.,1500.332,3.703
"Right after that press conference, the White",1504.035,1.368
House reached out to the Congressional Black,1505.403,1.936
"Caucus, to Cedric Richmond, the head",1507.339,2.269
of the caucus.,1509.608,1.935
Where is that meeting?,1511.543,1.835
Where does that meeting land?,1513.378,2.002
Is it happening?,1515.38,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: I know that we&amp;#39;ve reached out, and",1516.715,1.601
"we&amp;#39;re looking for a date on that, as well.",1518.316,1.368
So we&amp;#39;re pleased that this one was able to come,1519.684,3.07
"together, and then we&amp;#39;ll get to the next one.",1522.754,2.202
The Press: My last question.,1524.956,0.601
Mr. Spicer: Yes.,1525.557,0.534
The Press: Yesterday there was a compare-and-contrast,1526.091,2.269
"with visuals, show and tell if you will --",1528.36,3.77
"Mr. Spicer: Yes, I saw that --",1532.13,1.001
"The Press: Yes, you were -- yes.",1533.131,1.702
And you compared and contrasted about how,1534.833,3.837
you&amp;#39;re going about it and how the Obama,1538.67,2.102
administration went about Obamacare.,1540.772,2.903
One difference that they&amp;#39;ve made note of --,1543.675,3.103
and I want to get your response to this -- is the,1546.778,1.869
fact that you may have this and said that you&amp;#39;re,1548.647,2.302
doing this versus what they&amp;#39;re doing -- the one,1550.949,2.836
thing they say that you did not do that they did:,1553.785,3.303
had their bill scored by CBO.,1557.088,1.969
And you did not score it by CBO.,1559.057,1.335
Mr. Spicer: Sure.,1560.392,0.667
It is being scored.,1561.059,0.667
"Look, I know -- look, with all due respect to them,",1561.726,2.937
this the same group that said -- who passed it and,1564.663,2.469
then told us we could read it.,1567.132,2.202
This bill is online for every American to go to,1569.334,2.97
ReadTheBill.gop.,1572.304,1.801
It&amp;#39;s on the Speaker&amp;#39;s website.,1574.105,1.302
We link to it on several,1575.407,1.668
accounts that we&amp;#39;ve tweeted.,1577.075,0.901
The Press: But it was scored before they went,1577.976,1.601
before the Congress.,1579.577,0.701
Mr. Spicer: I understand that.,1580.278,2.002
"And again, if that&amp;#39;s the complaint, this is the",1582.28,0.768
"same group that didn&amp;#39;t let anybody read it, that",1583.048,1.601
jammed it through with no bipartisan support.,1584.649,2.67
This President has reached out to both sides of the,1587.319,1.801
"aisle, had governors here, had senators here",1589.12,2.236
to get their input.,1591.356,1.301
There is no contrast between what we did,1592.657,2.236
and what they did.,1594.893,1.001
This was a full effort to reach out to the members,1595.894,1.968
in the House and the Senate.,1597.862,1.202
It&amp;#39;s going through regular order in the House.,1599.064,2.569
Every member of the House and the Senate will be,1601.633,1.902
able to have their opportunity to have,1603.535,1.668
"amendments offered through -- well, through the",1605.203,1.568
committee process and on the floor.,1606.771,1.969
So the idea that they can compare the date that they,1608.74,3.27
got it scored is pretty reaching deep on this,1612.01,1.935
because there has been an opportunity for members to,1613.945,2.069
have their input on this and to talk about their,1616.014,3.27
"concerns, to give their input on it -- especially",1619.284,2.469
"the governors, who were left on the sideline last",1621.753,2.536
time and who have such an important role in,1624.289,2.135
administering healthcare when it comes to Medicaid.,1626.424,2.469
The idea that anyone talks about when the score was,1628.893,2.436
issued -- there will be a score in all good time.,1631.329,2.269
"But the other thing is, let&amp;#39;s be honest, the irony",1633.598,2.403
of the score is that the CBO was way,1636.001,2.869
off the last time.,1638.87,1.135
I don&amp;#39;t think that we&amp;#39;re waiting to -- that that&amp;#39;s,1640.005,3.636
a big issue to us right now.,1643.641,2.036
"The Press: Doesn&amp;#39;t cost matter, though, before you",1645.677,0.734
"-- Mr. Spicer: Of course, cost matters.",1646.411,1.201
But look at how off they were last time.,1647.612,1.335
"If you&amp;#39;re looking at the CBO for accuracy, you&amp;#39;re",1648.947,2.035
looking in the wrong place.,1650.982,1.035
"They were way, way off last time in every aspect",1652.017,4.237
of how they scored and,1656.254,1.034
projected Obamacare in terms of --,1657.288,1.335
The Press: But you have no numbers --,1658.623,0.701
Mr. Spicer: But neither did they.,1659.324,1.902
"Last time, if you look at the number of people that",1661.226,1.368
"they projected would be on Obamacare, they are",1662.594,2.002
off by millions.,1664.596,1.368
So the idea that we&amp;#39;re waiting for a score -- it,1665.964,2.436
will be scored.,1668.4,1.234
But the idea that that&amp;#39;s any kind of authority,1669.634,1.969
based on the track record that occurred last time is,1671.603,1.802
a little far-fetched. Jessica.,1673.405,2.268
"The Press: Two questions on the wall, Sean.",1675.673,2.436
"As you know, the bids for prototypes went out today.",1678.109,3.203
"And I just was curious about the timing of that,",1681.312,3.738
how much pressure there was to get that,1685.05,1.568
going quickly.,1686.618,1.535
"And then secondly, is there guidance from the",1688.153,1.902
White House about what kinds of vendors can build,1690.055,2.502
"the wall, especially can international",1692.557,2.469
vendors build the wall?,1695.026,1.869
Mr. Spicer: I think that process is working through,1696.895,3.17
"-- as the President has talked about before, we",1700.065,2.802
were trying to move ahead with existing,1702.867,2.336
funds that DHS has.,1705.203,1.768
And then we&amp;#39;ll continue to create a timeline to ask,1706.971,3.737
Congress for that funding.,1710.708,2.47
We&amp;#39;re working with Congress on that.,1713.178,2.669
And then I don&amp;#39;t think it will be any surprise to,1715.847,1.969
know that the President is going to favor American,1717.816,2.302
workers and American companies when it comes to,1720.118,2.102
an American project.,1722.22,0.868
That shouldn&amp;#39;t be any kind of surprise. Blake.,1723.088,2.002
"The Press: Sean, it&amp;#39;s looking increasing likely",1725.09,1.634
that the Federal Reserve next week will hike,1726.724,2.436
interest rates.,1729.16,1.302
Two brief questions.,1730.462,0.7
"One, how does the President feel about that?",1731.162,1.568
"And secondly, does he have the full confidence in",1733.264,1.902
"Janet Yellen, who he described during the",1735.6,1.835
campaign as &amp;quot;too political&amp;quot; to lead the,1737.902,0.501
Federal Reserve and set monetary policy?,1739.27,1.235
Mr. Spicer: Let me get back to you on that one.,1741.072,1.001
I don&amp;#39;t have any comment on the Federal Reserve.,1742.474,1.401
I&amp;#39;ll look at the team.,1744.542,0.868
"What I will say is that, as I mentioned at the",1745.71,2.603
"outset, when you look at the hiring and the jobs",1748.713,3.003
"and the manufacturing and the pace, the consumer",1751.95,1.234
confidence and the CEO indexes that are going --,1753.451,2.336
"that have already come out in the first two months,",1756.02,1.702
"we see a resurgence, an optimism in the economy by",1757.989,2.936
"job creators to want to hire here, who want to",1761.826,1.902
"manufacture here, who want to grow here.",1764.095,1.568
And I think that our economy is clearly,1765.93,3.27
on the upswing.,1769.2,1.568
"And I think you see statement after statement,",1770.768,1.635
company after company coming out and sharing in,1772.67,3.037
the President&amp;#39;s vision for moving the country forward,1776.074,2.269
and for renewing the optimism and building and,1779.01,3.704
being part of an American resurgence in terms,1782.947,2.069
of our economy.,1785.25,0.634
"The Press: Just to be clear, the no comment was",1785.884,1.201
on Mrs. Yellen or on this thoughts of a rate hike?,1787.385,2.369
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;ll get back to you on both.,1789.754,0.934
How is that?,1790.989,0.534
"Yeah, go ahead.",1791.523,0.834
"The Press: Sean, along with April&amp;#39;s last question",1792.924,1.134
about the difference between this,1794.325,0.868
administration and the previous one and how to,1795.493,2.169
"approach this issue, one thing that the Obama",1797.662,2.536
administration did do was get key stakeholders at,1800.198,2.536
"the table -- AARP, American Medical Association.",1802.734,2.969
Both of those organizations have come,1805.703,2.736
out today strongly opposed to this proposal.,1808.439,1.535
"What&amp;#39;s your message, particularly with",1809.974,1.235
respect to the AARP?,1811.209,1.835
"Mr. Spicer: Well, they got a really good deal last",1813.044,1.668
time when it came to prescription drugs in,1814.712,1.936
particular.,1816.648,1.434
I think -- this is a patient-centric bill.,1818.082,2.636
It&amp;#39;s about patients.,1820.718,1.368
It&amp;#39;s about people.,1822.086,1.035
It&amp;#39;s about the Americans who were left behind.,1823.121,1.701
Look at what those deals got people last time.,1824.822,3.27
"I mean, for all those people that are on",1828.092,1.335
"Medicaid, in particular, they don&amp;#39;t",1829.427,1.769
have choices anymore.,1831.196,1.735
So I would argue that the President has put the,1832.931,2.202
American people first and has put patients first.,1835.133,3.103
So you can talk about -- we&amp;#39;re glad to have,1838.236,1.835
"support, make no mistake about it.",1840.071,2.769
But I think that the support that this,1842.84,1.902
administration and I think the House is focused on is,1844.742,2.937
getting every American their buy-in,1847.679,2.335
and their support.,1850.014,0.634
"Obviously, look, I&amp;#39;m not going to -- we would love",1850.648,3.003
to have every group on board.,1853.651,0.801
But this isn&amp;#39;t going to be -- every single deal we,1855.019,2.303
"heard about it getting through, &amp;quot;the Cornhusker",1857.622,1.969
"Kickback,&amp;quot; this and that.",1860.325,1.268
"Over and over again, it was one deal after another",1861.593,2.135
to get to -- to buy votes to get it,1864.229,1.468
through the Senate.,1865.964,1.835
So if you want line up how many special interests got,1867.799,1.835
"paid off last time versus now, they&amp;#39;ll probably",1869.968,2.902
win hands down.,1873.104,0.934
The Press: Sean --,1874.038,0.634
Mr. Spicer: This isn&amp;#39;t -- hold on --,1874.672,1.302
but this isn&amp;#39;t about trying to figure out,1875.974,1.434
how many special interests in Washington we,1877.408,1.669
can get paid off.,1879.077,2.469
It&amp;#39;s about making sure that patients get the best,1881.546,2.102
deal that lowers prices and brings back costs.,1883.648,2.035
"But again, I think -- what I&amp;#39;m trying to figure out",1885.683,2.87
is at some point you&amp;#39;re defending,1888.553,1.435
the indefensible.,1889.988,1.368
Nancy Pelosi put out three criteria for how they,1891.356,2.235
judge Obamacare.,1893.591,1.468
"And by their own standards, they",1895.059,1.202
fail on all three.,1896.261,1.568
Costs are up.,1897.829,0.734
Choices are down.,1898.563,1.601
There is no other way to judge that.,1900.164,2.803
"By every account, every single premium by every",1902.967,3.27
standard is up.,1906.237,1.502
Choices are down across the country.,1907.739,1.568
So there is a horrible deal that the American,1910.008,1.635
people got bought -- got sold.,1911.976,2.102
And what we&amp;#39;re trying to do is put patients back,1914.078,1.235
first in line.,1915.713,1.035
The Press: But so the AARP is specifically talking,1916.748,1.768
about patients in their 50s and 60s.,1918.516,1.969
The AARP describes this as an &amp;quot;age tax&amp;quot; that will,1920.485,2.435
disproportionately affect people who right now are,1923.354,3.17
"low-income, are benefitting from subsidies",1926.524,2.503
under Obamacare and could stand -- according to the,1929.027,2.035
AARP&amp;#39;s estimate -- to take a hit of thousands of,1931.062,2.402
dollars in their premium payments this year when,1933.464,2.136
the subsidies go away and the tax credits go away.,1935.933,1.569
What&amp;#39;s your message to those people who voted for,1937.869,1.535
the President?,1939.771,0.767
Mr. Spicer: I think that -- right.,1940.538,1.034
And the message from the President is that we want,1941.572,1.869
you to get more choice and a lower cost.,1943.441,0.534
"And I think that, as we work this bill through,",1944.709,2.269
through daylight -- not jam it through in the,1947.979,2.469
middle of the night -- that they are going to see,1950.915,1.635
as more and more people will that this is a deal,1953.618,2.202
for the American people that&amp;#39;s going to put,1956.087,1.201
"patients first, lower their costs, and give them",1957.288,1.735
more choices.,1959.257,0.867
"But again, I don&amp;#39;t -- there is probably not a",1960.124,1.735
"person out there, either through themselves or a",1962.56,2.369
loved one or a friend or a colleague that has seen,1965.129,3.604
choices go down and premiums go up [sic].,1968.9,1.635
So what people are dealing with now,1970.702,2.102
is not acceptable.,1972.804,1.701
And I think the idea that anyone defending the,1974.505,1.335
current status quo -- and even in some of the,1976.007,2.002
"statements of some of the groups, they admit that",1978.176,2.369
there&amp;#39;s a problem right now.,1980.712,1.301
"And so my advice to those people is,",1982.013,1.601
join the process.,1983.781,1.168
"Share your idea, share your thought, let the",1984.949,1.969
process work its will so that it is a bill,1986.918,1.802
that has input.,1988.886,2.203
But the bill -- the way it was done last time is not,1991.089,1.534
something that&amp;#39;s acceptable. Shannon.,1992.857,2.269
"The Press: Is the President worried, though,",1995.126,1.335
that every major doctors group -- the American,1996.627,1.802
"Medical Association, the American Academy of",1998.596,1.869
"Pediatrics, the American College of Physicians --",2000.631,1.535
have all come out and said they have,2002.333,1.602
serious concerns?,2004.135,1.268
For all the talk of doctors and patients and,2005.403,1.935
"choice, the doctors groups are all so far unanimously",2007.505,2.603
coming and saying they&amp;#39;re not supportive of this.,2010.274,1.735
Is that concerning to the President?,2012.21,1.168
"Mr. Spicer: No, I think when you look at a lot of",2013.578,1.234
doctors versus the associations here in,2014.812,2.87
"Washington, we have had tremendous input from",2017.682,2.736
doctors themselves.,2020.418,1.401
"Dr. Price, himself a doctor, is the one",2021.819,3.604
who crafted this.,2025.423,1.401
So you have a doctor in charge of the,2026.824,2.436
administration&amp;#39;s effort to work with Congress.,2029.26,2.936
You&amp;#39;ve got several physicians and other,2032.196,1.202
medical professionals in Congress that are talking,2033.398,2.602
"about the experiences they have -- in fact, many of",2036,1.568
them ran for Congress because of the concerns,2037.568,2.169
they saw in their own industry.,2039.737,2.169
So while I have respect for some of the work that,2041.906,3.67
"some of these Washington, D.C.-based associations",2045.576,2.036
"do, at the end of the day this is about patients and",2047.612,2.536
about the input from doctors who are on the,2050.148,1.935
front line of seeing patients and talking about,2052.083,1.735
the care that they&amp;#39;re able to give or not,2053.818,1.902
to give to people. Anita.,2055.72,1.568
The Press: Do you mind if I follow up on something,2057.288,1.535
else you said?,2058.823,0.934
"Mr. Spicer: I do -- I don&amp;#39;t, sorry.",2059.757,1.735
The Press: You&amp;#39;ve talked about people,2061.492,1.535
having a card.,2063.027,0.868
"You&amp;#39;ve got a card, but it&amp;#39;s a $2,000 deductible",2063.895,2.636
and there&amp;#39;s only 10 doctors in your town that,2066.531,1.534
"will see you, let&amp;#39;s say.",2068.065,1.669
But that&amp;#39;s better than nothing if you get cancer,2069.734,2.769
or hit by a car.,2072.503,1.135
"So maybe this makes access -- right, but it is better",2073.638,2.369
than no insurance.,2076.34,1.669
"So if this expands access to people and choice, but",2078.276,3.436
it reduces the number of people who actually have,2081.879,3.337
health insurance --,2085.783,0.434
Mr. Spicer: But I don&amp;#39;t think --,2086.217,0.901
The Press: -- so can it do both?,2087.118,0.801
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, of course it can.",2087.919,0.967
"And it will do both, by ensuring that more people",2088.886,2.536
-- right now you&amp;#39;ve got more people paying the,2091.422,2.102
"penalty and saying, I don&amp;#39;t want healthcare, I&amp;#39;m",2093.524,2.236
going to pay the penalty because costs,2095.76,2.235
are too high.,2098.229,0.901
"And was it probably five, six, seven years ago,",2099.13,2.269
"before Obamacare went into place, a single",2101.632,2.069
"individual, young individual person on the",2104.669,2.502
open market could get a premium -- a plan with a,2107.672,3.236
"premium of 100, 150 bucks a month.",2111.342,2.569
It&amp;#39;s in the high 300s now.,2113.911,2.202
And I think that there&amp;#39;s a big difference.,2116.113,1.035
You&amp;#39;re not -- for young people just entering the,2117.482,1.501
"workplace, for example, your example -- they go",2119.25,2.669
"get into an accident, right now you&amp;#39;ve got a lot",2122.153,1.702
of individuals that get off their parents&amp;#39;,2124.121,1.202
"healthcare and say, I&amp;#39;m healthy, I have no desire",2125.523,2.235
"to go get healthcare, it&amp;#39;s another few hundred",2128.025,1.869
dollars a month that I don&amp;#39;t have or that I&amp;#39;d,2130.294,1.635
rather spend on something else.,2132.196,0.701
"If we can get that cost down, it makes a lot more",2133.13,2.503
sense -- and get them plans that are tailored to,2135.833,2.236
"them, 27-, 28-year-old individuals don&amp;#39;t need",2138.069,3.804
care that&amp;#39;s for folks -- that talks about certain,2141.873,3.703
things that -- a plan that has certain things that,2145.576,2.336
are towards the end of life.,2147.912,2.135
"But right now, you&amp;#39;ve got one-size-fits-all,",2150.047,2.036
"government-run, government-mandated plans",2152.083,2.436
that offer people a suite of medical services that,2154.519,4.137
"they do not need, because there&amp;#39;s no choice, and",2158.656,2.97
it&amp;#39;s a government-mandated system.,2161.626,1.434
I think offering more choice and more,2163.06,1.368
competition allows people to pick a plan that is,2164.428,3.337
more tailored to your needs.,2167.765,0.934
And this goes back a second ago to what John,2168.699,1.302
"was asking, that if you can actually pick a plan",2170.001,4.07
and across state lines find one that suits you as,2174.071,3.037
an individual -- as opposed to maybe there&amp;#39;s a,2177.108,2.736
"family plan that&amp;#39;s more comprehensive, it has",2179.844,2.836
dental and vision and all the things that your kids,2182.68,2.569
are going to need because of all the things you,2185.616,1.335
anticipate -- that&amp;#39;s a plan that a young family,2187.585,3.637
might need versus an older person that&amp;#39;s single or a,2191.856,3.27
young person that&amp;#39;s just entering the workforce.,2195.326,1.201
"But right now there&amp;#39;s no competition,",2196.694,1.935
there&amp;#39;s no choice.,2198.629,1.168
So it&amp;#39;s not an either/or situation.,2199.797,1.835
We&amp;#39;re facing a situation where more and more people,2201.632,2.236
are getting less and less and paying more and more,2204.035,1.801
"for it, and that&amp;#39;s the wrong way to go. Mara.",2205.836,1.869
The Press: Anita.,2207.705,0.667
You actually -- Anita.,2208.372,2.069
Mr. Spicer: My apologies.,2210.441,1.068
"Anita, then Mara.",2211.509,1.034
"The Press: Switching gears completely, the military",2212.543,4.405
have recently conducted some kind of exercise at,2216.948,3.903
"the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, and it was",2220.851,2.937
preparing for a migrant crisis.,2223.788,2.669
And there is a DHS migrant center there.,2226.457,2.236
And I wondered if the administration has,2228.693,1.368
"considered, and what you all think about using that",2230.595,3.436
facility for immigrants.,2234.432,2.068
Has that come up?,2237.468,0.501
"Mr. Spicer: That particular exercise, to",2238.402,2.369
"the best of my knowledge, is a rather regular",2241.105,1.535
"exercise that occurs, as do many of the exercises",2243.107,2.269
that the military prepares for on a whole host of,2245.876,2.403
contingency operations.,2248.546,1.234
So that is a routine military operation.,2249.78,3.704
"The Press: Is there any consideration, though?",2254.251,0.701
Mr. Spicer: It is a routine military,2255.219,2.369
"operation, as several of them do with our partners",2257.588,4.438
throughout the world where we plan for random,2262.026,1.868
contingencies that may or may not happen.,2263.894,1.902
That&amp;#39;s the job of the military -- to practice,2265.796,1.936
for contingencies that may or may not happen on a,2267.732,2.202
whole host of issues.,2269.934,2.502
But to try to ascertain --,2272.436,0.868
"The Press: Okay, so are",2273.304,1.101
you all considering using the facility,2274.405,3.47
for immigrants?,2277.875,0.934
Mr. Spicer: There is nothing to,2278.809,0.701
consider it for.,2279.51,0.934
I think we&amp;#39;re fine right now.,2280.444,1.869
There is nothing that we would need to use it for.,2282.313,2.235
"But again, I mean, I think part of the goal of",2284.548,2.269
preparing the military going through various,2286.817,2.102
exercises is on a whole host of issues -- on,2288.919,3.003
"refugees, they prepare for natural disasters.",2291.922,2.937
"We&amp;#39;re not anticipating a natural disaster, but we",2294.859,3.837
prepare for them.,2298.696,2.569
"At the White House, when we were coming in as an",2301.265,2.77
"administration, I think we briefed during the",2304.035,3.203
transition period -- we did what&amp;#39;s called a,2307.238,2.402
"right-seat, left-seat operation with the",2309.64,1.502
outgoing administration.,2311.142,1.167
So we sat down and talked about cyberattacks and,2312.309,2.97
"natural disasters, and the whole-of-government",2315.279,2.736
response in some of these things.,2318.015,2.169
"It doesn&amp;#39;t mean that we anticipate them, it",2320.184,1.568
"doesn&amp;#39;t mean that we want them, it means that we&amp;#39;re",2321.752,1.769
going to prepare for them in the same way that many,2323.521,2.602
organizations do fire drills.,2326.123,2.603
It&amp;#39;s not that you anticipate or expect a,2328.726,1.802
"fire, but you prepare for them, as many families do.",2330.528,2.536
"Preparedness is the key to executing well, and I",2333.064,2.068
think that&amp;#39;s what all we&amp;#39;re doing.,2335.132,1.168
"The Press: And secondarily, the",2336.3,2.469
Louisville media is reporting that President,2338.769,2.369
Trump will be there on Saturday.,2341.138,2.002
Can you confirm that?,2343.14,1.135
And is this about healthcare?,2344.275,1.735
"As you just said, he was going to make the rounds.",2346.01,2.002
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, I&amp;#39;ve seen that report.",2348.012,1.768
We have nothing to announce with respect to,2349.78,1.635
the President&amp;#39;s schedule at this time.,2351.415,1.468
"But, as I mentioned earlier to I think it was",2352.883,2.303
"Shannon, that we will have -- or is it Jill, I can&amp;#39;t",2355.186,4.571
-- somewhere in this area -- we will have an update,2359.757,4.638
on the President&amp;#39;s schedule later this week.,2364.395,2.169
But I do anticipate the President to be very,2366.564,2.269
active in his support for,2368.833,3.503
the repeal-and-replace effort.,2372.336,2.169
And so this is what you should expect.,2374.505,3.103
Now Mara.,2377.608,1.101
The Press: The CBO score is supposed to come out,2378.709,2.603
"next week, and you just called into question",2381.312,1.868
their credibility.,2383.18,1.101
Mr. Spicer: I didn&amp;#39;t call into question -- just so,2384.281,1.302
"we&amp;#39;re clear, I&amp;#39;m just --",2385.583,1.301
The Press: It&amp;#39;s true.,2386.884,0.868
"Mr. Spicer: Thanks, Matt, I appreciate it,",2387.752,1.267
I can answer.,2389.019,1.135
Their record is what I&amp;#39;m calling into question to,2390.154,1.501
-- when you look at the number of people and the,2391.655,2.203
"costs on what they scored, the last Obamacare bill",2393.858,4.304
"on, it&amp;#39;s way off.",2398.162,1.935
"That&amp;#39;s a fact, that&amp;#39;s not anything more than that.",2400.097,3.871
"The Press: Well, people base their votes on what",2403.968,1.868
they think is going to happen to the cost and the,2405.836,2.436
coverage -- if they lose coverage.,2408.272,1.668
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s right.,2409.94,1.101
The Press: Is there any analytic organization that,2411.041,3.304
you would accept a score from?,2414.345,2.602
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think that there&amp;#39;s -- yeah, I",2416.947,1.602
mean OMB will probably put out a score on -- The,2418.549,2.836
"Press: If not the CBO, is there some organization --",2421.385,0.768
so OMB is the --,2422.153,0.433
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, I&amp;#39;m",2422.586,1.068
"not saying -- but, Mara, hold on.",2423.654,1.135
"All I&amp;#39;m saying is, look at what the CBO&amp;#39;s record",2424.789,1.735
is on Obamacare.,2426.524,1.768
It&amp;#39;s vastly off.,2428.292,1.101
I think they projected 20 million people to be on,2429.393,2.136
Obamacare this year; I believe the number is 12.,2431.529,1.067
They&amp;#39;re way off in terms of the millions.,2432.596,3.437
So it&amp;#39;s not a question of whether I&amp;#39;m questioning,2436.033,2.503
anything -- anyone that can actually do basic math,2438.536,4.271
can understand that their projections for Obamacare,2442.807,2.435
"the last time were way, way off the mark.",2445.242,3.07
"And so my only point is, is that I think when they",2448.312,2.302
"come out with this score, we need to understand the",2450.614,2.002
track record when it comes to healthcare.,2452.616,1.936
The Press: -- the track record?,2454.552,1.101
Is there any scoring organization that you,2455.653,2.269
think has a good track record?,2457.922,1.134
Mr. Spicer: There&amp;#39;s probably a lot.,2459.056,1.135
And I think members have to look at a lot of things,2460.191,1.234
to cast their vote on.,2461.425,1.135
They&amp;#39;re going to have to look at the totality of,2462.56,3.203
"the bill, the support of their constituents, the",2465.763,4.704
current state of things.,2470.467,1.068
"I think that there&amp;#39;s no question -- look, when you",2471.535,2.436
look at the trajectory of the cost right now in,2473.971,2.169
"terms of premiums, you can either say -- and not just",2476.14,3.503
"the premiums, but Obamacare is going to",2479.643,2.369
collapse on its own weight very soon.,2482.012,2.203
And the President made it very clear in his press,2484.215,2.636
"conference and a lot of previous statements, the",2486.851,1.801
politically easy thing to do is just let it collapse,2488.652,3.037
and let Democrats come back to the table.,2491.689,1.968
"I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s the right thing, and the",2493.657,1.502
President has made it clear he doesn&amp;#39;t think,2495.159,1.234
that&amp;#39;s the right thing.,2496.393,1.068
This is an opportunity for him to show the American,2497.461,3.504
people that the right thing to do is to care,2500.965,1.635
about their healthcare options and the cost that,2502.6,1.801
they&amp;#39;re paying.,2504.401,1.135
The Press: And just one last thing.,2505.536,1.134
He mentioned deductibles before and how they&amp;#39;re,2506.67,1.936
going up under Obamacare.,2508.606,1.101
Are you promising people that their deductibles,2509.707,1.635
will come down under this plan?,2511.342,2.002
Mr. Spicer: Everything that we have been led to,2513.344,2.035
"believe about how this is -- yes, this will",2515.379,2.069
drive costs down.,2517.448,1.168
"When you talk about opening up pooling, when",2518.616,2.502
you talk about driving costs down because you can,2521.118,2.302
"buy it over state lines, everything that has driven",2523.42,1.235
"up costs, all of those market forces that will",2524.655,4.705
"come in, and I think every leading economist that has",2529.36,3.503
looked at this says it will drive costs down.,2532.863,1.668
John Gizzi.,2534.531,1.102
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",2535.633,1.067
"The premier argument by Democrats, notably former",2536.7,5.072
"President Obama today, is that enactment of the act",2541.772,5.072
that was illustrated yesterday would lead to,2546.844,5.238
many people losing their healthcare.,2552.082,4.338
"You certainly heard that from Democrats, but also",2556.42,3.67
several of the Republican governors who were here,2560.09,1.168
"for the National Governors Association, including",2561.258,2.67
strong allies of the President -- Governor,2563.928,2.669
"Bentley of Alabama, Governor Hutchinson of",2566.597,2.803
Arkansas voiced the same concern.,2569.4,3.103
They did not want any plan that would lead to anyone,2572.503,3.136
losing their present healthcare.,2575.639,2.503
What does the administration say to what,2578.142,3.737
is the leading argument against a new plan?,2581.879,3.904
And then I have a follow-up question.,2585.783,1.401
Mr. Spicer: Of course.,2587.184,1.135
I would say that any governor that is concerned,2588.319,2.202
about people losing care right now should join us.,2590.521,3.737
"They are losing their care right now, they are losing",2594.258,2.069
"their options, and they are paying too much.",2596.327,2.268
"So the answer is that, if you&amp;#39;re concerned about",2598.595,2.87
"those principles, then you should be concerned with",2601.465,2.536
"what is happening right now, and you should be",2604.001,2.102
concerned and want to join in this administration and,2606.103,2.736
work with this Congress.,2608.839,1.768
"And again, the big difference that&amp;#39;s here is,",2610.607,3.037
"instead of us jamming a bill down Congress, and",2613.644,1.935
now allowing the American people to read it until it,2615.579,2.035
"is passed, as was done with Obamacare with",2617.614,2.57
"then-Speaker Pelosi, is that this bill is out in",2620.184,2.469
the open for every single person in the,2622.653,1.835
world to read.,2624.488,1.201
It is open for people to let their member of,2625.689,2.836
"Congress share their thoughts, share their",2628.525,2.069
"ideas, and it&amp;#39;s done out in the open.",2630.594,2.603
I think that is a vastly different approach with,2633.197,2.536
"how this is going about than the last time, and",2635.733,1.801
that makes a big difference,2637.534,1.135
with the approach.,2638.669,2.436
And it gives people an opportunity through the,2641.105,2.802
"process, what they call regular order, to have",2643.907,2.169
input on this.,2646.076,1.035
"And if it can be made better, then great.",2647.111,1.835
"But I think this time, we recognized that there&amp;#39;s a",2648.946,2.602
lot of work that needs to get done on behalf of the,2651.548,1.802
patients that are having trouble getting care. Alexis.,2653.35,3.871
"The Press: Oh, wait.",2657.221,1.001
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sorry.,2658.222,1.001
The Press: My follow-up question is a follow-up,2659.223,1.468
question about the wall.,2660.691,2.202
During the recent Governors Association,2662.893,3.937
"meeting, Governor Graco Ramirez, who is the",2666.83,3.938
Chairman of Mexico&amp;#39;s Association of Federated,2670.768,3.27
"Governors, warned that continued discussion about",2674.038,3.57
the wall and the President&amp;#39;s talk of,2677.608,2.402
building it might very well lead to the election,2680.01,3.804
"of Mr. Lopez Obrador as the President of Mexico,",2683.814,3.87
"and he is considered the most anti-American, most",2687.684,3.471
hostile-to-America of any of the candidates.,2691.155,2.736
Are there any concerns that come up in the,2693.891,1.935
"discussion of the wall, namely the impact on",2695.826,2.569
Mexican politics?,2698.395,1.402
Mr. Spicer: No.,2699.797,1.067
(Laughter.),2700.864,1.769
That was pretty good.,2702.633,1.435
The President&amp;#39;s number-one concern is the safety,2704.068,3.069
of our country.,2707.137,1.702
Number two is the jobs that are impacted by this,2708.839,3.103
and the ability of Americans to get the wage,2711.942,2.703
that they deserve.,2714.645,1.968
"But again, this is a national security issue,",2716.613,2.069
"something that, frankly, when he&amp;#39;s discussed this",2718.682,2.503
"with President Peña Nieto of Mexico, that -- there",2721.185,3.703
"is a shared concern about drug cartels, drug",2724.888,4.038
"trafficking, arms sales over the border.",2728.926,3.336
There is a shared concern for the respect of the,2732.262,3.17
"border, because it means a lot to both sides.",2735.432,3.337
So this is something that we care about from a,2738.769,3.17
"national security standpoint, and then",2741.939,2.002
obviously the President is concerned on it both -- as,2743.941,2.002
well as on an economic standpoint. Alexis.,2745.943,1.935
The Press: I want to follow up on what John was,2747.878,1.835
just -- your answer was that if the healthcare,2749.713,2.302
"bill could be made better, the President is",2752.015,2.136
interested in that.,2754.151,1.001
"So could I just clarify, when he meets with the",2755.152,2.569
congressional conservatives this evening,2757.721,1.935
"who have misgivings about the legislation, is he",2759.656,5.506
intending to talk to them about what they would like,2765.162,2.336
"to change, and is he open to making those changes?",2767.498,3.37
"Is that what he -- is that the mode he&amp;#39;s in, rather",2770.868,2.369
than a sell mode?,2773.237,1.334
He&amp;#39;s in a listening mode?,2774.571,1.835
Mr. Spicer: I think he&amp;#39;s in a -- very much,2776.406,1.135
of a sell mode.,2777.541,1.835
The President and his team have worked very,2779.376,2.236
hard on this.,2781.612,1.034
They&amp;#39;re very proud of the effort and the product,2782.646,2.736
that they have produced in consultation with the,2785.382,2.069
House and the Senate.,2787.451,1.001
"But obviously, it&amp;#39;s going through the process.",2788.452,3.303
And so if somebody has an idea -- and that could be,2791.755,2.903
on the administration&amp;#39;s side -- that we believe,2794.658,3.504
that after a consultation with individuals or,2798.162,1.835
"groups, that there&amp;#39;s a way to improve upon this --",2799.997,2.802
but that&amp;#39;s the beauty of going through the,2802.799,1.335
process that we are.,2804.134,0.968
"But make no mistake, the President is very proud of",2805.102,2.269
the product that we have produced.,2807.371,1.468
We are out in full sell mode all around the,2808.839,2.669
country talking about how we think this is the best,2811.508,2.569
way to solve the problem that the American people,2814.077,2.736
"face, and why we believe that the solutions that we",2816.813,4.338
"put forward in this bill are the right ones, and",2821.151,3.47
that will benefit them.,2824.621,1.435
Go ahead.,2826.056,1.034
The Press: And can I follow up and say --,2827.09,1.001
before the President meets with Chancellor Merkel,2828.091,3.904
"next week, is it possible that we could see the",2831.995,2.303
President for a more general multi-question,2834.298,3.169
news conference?,2837.467,0.935
He&amp;#39;s been a little press-shy this week.,2838.402,2.402
And from North Korea to healthcare selling to CIA,2840.804,4.638
"leaks, we&amp;#39;d love to talk to him.",2845.442,1.802
Could we see him for a news conference?,2847.244,1.568
"Mr. Spicer: I will ask, Alexis.",2848.812,1.001
(Laughter.),2849.813,1.068
The Press: Would you ask him that?,2850.881,1.101
(Laughter.),2851.982,0.934
Mr. Spicer: I there anyone else?,2852.916,1.201
I would be glad to ask -- show of hands.,2854.117,2.203
(Laughter.),2856.32,2.369
"Okay, thank you, I appreciate it.",2858.689,1.368
"I would be glad to ask the President, share your",2860.057,3.003
"request with him, and I&amp;#39;ll see what we can do",2863.06,1.701
on his schedule.,2864.761,1.001
But as you can -- he is very busy these days.,2865.762,3.504
"He has done a lot of sprays, he will continue",2869.266,2.769
to interact with you guys.,2872.035,1.068
But I will be glad to make your request known. Katie.,2873.103,4.505
"The Press: Sean, yesterday Secretary Price said that",2877.608,3.47
"the bill that you guys have introduced, both the",2881.078,1.968
"repeal and the replace, are starting points.",2883.046,2.57
And on Capitol Hill there was a lot of talk of the,2885.616,3.603
starting point being a nonstarter.,2889.219,3.537
So it seems like there&amp;#39;s negotiations that,2892.756,1.401
need to be made.,2894.157,1.001
Does the President have any non-negotiables in his,2895.158,1.335
"bill that he will not take out, even at the request",2896.493,2.035
of conservatives?,2898.528,1.669
"Mr. Spicer: Well, Katie, I mean, I think, as I was",2900.197,2.736
"just saying to Alexis, that it is a",2902.933,3.103
starting point.,2906.036,1.602
It&amp;#39;s going through regular order in the House.,2907.638,1.935
And so part of that process as it goes through,2909.573,2.069
"the committee markup hearing, both in Ways and",2911.642,1.868
Means and House Energy and Commerce Committee -- that,2913.51,2.636
by its very nature allows for input through both of,2916.146,4.404
those committees and then ultimately on the floor,2920.55,2.403
"before it moves over to the Senate, and the Senate",2922.953,1.468
goes through a similar process.,2924.421,1.034
"So I think, frankly, we&amp;#39;re just acknowledging the",2925.455,2.002
reality of where the process is.,2927.457,2.837
"But we&amp;#39;re proud of the process, we&amp;#39;re proud of",2930.294,3.136
"the input that we&amp;#39;ve received from governors,",2933.43,2.269
"from senators, from individuals,",2935.699,1.401
"associations, companies.",2937.1,1.669
And we feel very proud of the work that is,2938.769,2.002
"encapsulated in this bill, and the results",2940.771,3.537
that it will yield.,2944.308,1.501
"And so that being said, I think the President",2945.809,2.102
"understands, as a businessman, that if",2947.911,2.002
someone&amp;#39;s got a really good idea that he&amp;#39;s going,2949.913,2.169
to listen to it.,2952.082,0.934
And if he can be part of the process to help make,2953.016,1.869
"something better, there&amp;#39;s nothing that&amp;#39;s going to",2954.885,2.102
preclude that.,2956.987,0.801
We have been very open to listening to people.,2957.788,1.868
We&amp;#39;re very proud of that.,2959.656,1.301
"We&amp;#39;re going to go out, as I said, in full sell mode.",2960.957,1.969
"But if there&amp;#39;s an idea that comes across, we&amp;#39;re",2962.926,2.569
going to entertain that to make it clear. Hallie.,2965.495,2.603
"The Press: Sean, two topics here.",2968.098,1.335
"First on healthcare, then I&amp;#39;ll have a",2969.433,2.002
follow-up on that.,2971.435,1.034
"In the past, you and others have accused",2972.469,1.335
Democrats of rushing through the original,2973.804,1.501
healthcare law.,2975.305,1.001
"Now, there are some Republicans, including",2976.306,1.668
"today, who say this is simply moving too fast.",2977.974,2.803
Is the President willing to accept a delayed,2980.777,2.036
timeline if it pushes repeal and replace into,2982.813,2.769
later in the year?,2985.582,1.168
Mr. Spicer: Going through the process can&amp;#39;t be,2986.75,2.402
"delayed -- I mean, by its very nature.",2989.152,1.235
We&amp;#39;re going through the committee process.,2990.387,2.069
There are two House committees --,2992.456,2.969
The Press: But you said the timeline is being -- maybe,2995.425,1.335
Easter break -- after that --,2996.76,1.234
"Mr. Spicer: But again,",2997.994,1.469
"that&amp;#39;s subject -- right, but again, I would argue",2999.463,2.936
it&amp;#39;s subject to how the House does its will and,3002.399,0.934
then how the Senate does.,3003.333,1.301
I think obviously we would like this to move forward.,3004.634,1.569
There&amp;#39;s a lot of stuff in the queue.,3006.203,1.835
We&amp;#39;ve talked about tax reform.,3008.038,1.635
This bill is attached to the FY17 budget,3009.673,3.203
"reconciliation, and I know that, for a lot of",3012.876,2.369
"Americans, that means nothing in terms of the",3015.245,2.836
phrase and the nomenclature that,3018.081,1.669
surrounds how Congress does it.,3019.75,1.735
But it&amp;#39;s important to recognize that that,3021.485,1.701
vehicle allows Congress to do certain things and not,3023.186,3.737
others with a 50-vote -- with a majority,3026.923,3.17
vote in the Senate.,3030.093,1.135
That&amp;#39;s important.,3031.228,1.535
"There are certain things you can do through that,",3032.763,1.534
"that you can&amp;#39;t do through other vehicles, and that",3034.297,3.17
will take a 60 vote and -- that you can,3037.467,2.67
do administratively.,3040.137,0.834
So it&amp;#39;s actually -- if you heard Dr. Price talk,3040.971,2.769
"yesterday about the three phases, it&amp;#39;s actually",3043.74,2.87
"multi-phased, it&amp;#39;s going through regular order.",3046.61,3.069
But there is simply no contrast between how we,3049.679,2.269
are approaching this and how Democrats,3051.948,1.802
approached it last time.,3053.75,1.135
"Number one, there&amp;#39;s actually been input from",3054.885,2.302
"across the aisle, both from the governors who",3057.187,2.436
"were here, attorneys general, outside groups,",3059.623,3.503
House and Senate Democrats have been able to provide,3063.126,4.371
"input to both staff, to the senior administration",3067.497,2.536
officials and to the President.,3070.033,1.101
"And then secondly, it&amp;#39;s actually going",3071.134,2.269
through the process.,3073.403,1.135
"So while we can predict a timeline, ultimately, it&amp;#39;s",3074.538,2.602
going to be up to the House and then the Senate,3077.14,1.935
to determine how fast it goes.,3079.075,0.901
"But there are members on each of those committees,",3079.976,2.57
"and then, ultimately, every member on the floor",3082.546,1.868
that has the ability to give input.,3084.414,1.735
The Press: Just one other question.,3086.149,0.934
I&amp;#39;m just curious about this meeting with Senator,3087.083,1.001
Cruz tonight.,3088.084,0.801
He has come out and expressed some skepticism,3088.885,1.769
on the bill as it stands now.,3090.654,2.302
Presumably that will be part of the topic of,3092.956,1.635
"conversation, but as you mentioned, Heidi Cruz is",3094.591,1.902
"coming too, and I&amp;#39;m wondering if the President",3096.493,1.435
has any plans to apologize to her for the,3097.928,1.835
insinuations he made on the campaign trail.,3099.763,1.768
Mr. Spicer: I think they&amp;#39;re looking,3101.531,1.101
forward to a great dinner.,3102.632,0.868
He had dinner with the Rubios a couple of days,3103.5,4.338
"ago, maybe a week ago.",3107.838,1.301
He had lunch yesterday with Senator Graham.,3109.139,2.336
"As I stated weeks ago, the President is going to",3111.475,3.069
continue to have outreach to members of,3114.544,1.902
Congress of both parties.,3116.446,1.502
He&amp;#39;s meeting with,3117.948,1.334
Congressman Cummings today.,3119.282,2.67
This is a President who wants to engage with,3121.952,2.636
"members of both sides of the aisle in both Houses,",3124.588,3.67
"but also groups, business leaders, union leaders,",3128.258,3.804
"the AFL-CIO head, Richard Trumka,",3132.062,4.07
was here yesterday.,3136.132,0.801
This is a President that&amp;#39;s going to engage with,3136.933,2.036
everybody that can help join in proposing ideas,3138.969,3.737
and thoughts and opinions on how to move the,3142.706,1.802
country forward.,3144.508,0.767
So he looks forward to dinner tonight with,3145.275,1.835
"Senator and Mrs. Cruz, as he has",3147.11,1.769
with several others.,3148.879,1.067
And I think you&amp;#39;re going to see more -- a,3149.946,1.735
continuation of this kind of effort to reach out and,3151.681,2.069
get people&amp;#39;s ideas. Margaret.,3153.75,2.035
"The Press: And then -- I apologize, I have a second",3155.785,1.202
"topic, which is, does the President believe the CIA",3156.987,2.435
has been compromised in any way?,3159.422,2.069
"Mr. Spicer: With respect to the disclosure, is that",3161.491,1.335
what you&amp;#39;re -- The Press: yeah.,3162.826,1.435
"Mr. Spicer: Again, I&amp;#39;m not going to -- it&amp;#39;s U.S.",3164.261,1.868
government policy not to confirm this.,3166.129,1.502
"I think he has obviously been very concerned, as I",3167.631,4.137
"stated, about the disclosure of national",3171.768,2.536
security on any level.,3174.304,1.034
It undermines our country&amp;#39;s national security.,3175.338,2.403
"And I think that -- I just will say, I think there&amp;#39;s",3177.741,4.037
also been a big double standard when it comes to,3181.778,1.668
disclosures of classified information and the,3183.446,4.672
outrage that exists when one side has it,3188.118,3.603
happens versus another.,3191.721,1.468
The Press: What do you mean?,3193.189,0.868
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think that there has been a lot",3194.057,2.736
of disclosures about national security that,3196.793,2.803
occurred last cycle when there was potential that,3199.596,3.136
the FBI had leaked certain information.,3202.732,3.003
The members of Congress on the other side of the,3205.735,2.67
"aisle, Hillary Clinton, and others talked about",3208.405,2.135
how there was so much concern about classified,3210.54,3.937
information -- we&amp;#39;re seeing such silence and,3214.477,2.136
"outrage from the media, from others with the",3216.613,2.536
current disclosures now with things that may or,3219.149,3.069
may not have happened towards the 2016 election,3222.218,1.569
when it comes to this side.,3223.787,1.368
So I think there&amp;#39;s a vast difference when it comes,3225.155,1.468
to how the disclosures are approached. Yeah.,3226.623,2.369
"The Press: Sean, on North Korea, what is President",3228.992,4.304
"Trump&amp;#39;s position toward North Korea, and what is",3233.296,3.604
his decision for the North Korean policy?,3236.9,4.905
Mr. Spicer: On the which --,3241.805,1.301
The Press: North Korean policy.,3243.106,1.368
Mr. Spicer: On the politics?,3244.474,0.968
"The Press: No, policy.",3245.442,1.468
The Press: Policies.,3246.91,0.901
"Mr. Spicer: Oh, policies.",3247.811,0.867
"Well, I mean, we&amp;#39;re very troubled by the launch of",3248.678,4.505
missiles that have occurred from North Korea.,3253.183,1.501
I think that&amp;#39;s why the THAAD missile system that,3254.684,2.436
we&amp;#39;ve started to deploy into South Korea is,3257.12,2.736
so important.,3259.856,0.734
We&amp;#39;re continuing to work with the government of,3260.59,2.069
South Korea to make sure that they have the,3262.659,4.805
defenses necessary to protect themselves.,3267.464,3.103
The deployment of a THAAD system is critical to,3270.567,3.036
"their protection, as witnessed by this",3273.603,3.504
weekend&amp;#39;s ballistic missile test.,3277.107,0.834
China and the United States in particular both,3277.941,3.103
understand the threat that North Korea poses,3281.044,1.201
to the region.,3282.245,2.736
And I think that there&amp;#39;s areas of concern that we,3284.981,1.769
can work together to protect the country. Trey.,3286.75,2.402
The Press: You had called on me.,3289.152,1.168
The Press: Today was International Women&amp;#39;s Day.,3290.32,1.968
There&amp;#39;s a lot of concern about access to,3292.288,2.169
healthcare for women.,3294.457,1.502
Will the President commit to reaching out to female,3295.959,2.836
Democratic lawmakers as the next two phases of,3298.795,3.003
this healthcare bill continue?,3301.798,2.603
"And additionally, what is the President&amp;#39;s stance on",3304.401,2.135
access to birth control,3306.536,1.168
for women across the country?,3307.704,1.768
Mr. Spicer: I think that question was asked and,3309.472,1.902
answered by Secretary Price yesterday.,3311.374,1.802
"With respect to women&amp;#39;s health, the President has",3313.176,4.104
also made it clear that he intends to have a,3317.28,1.969
substantial increase in funding towards women,3319.249,3.069
community centers that,3322.318,1.869
fund women&amp;#39;s health services.,3324.187,3.07
And that will be reflected in his budget.,3327.257,1.401
Margaret.,3328.658,1.635
The Press: Thank you.,3330.293,0.734
Mr. Spicer: Sorry.,3331.027,0.668
"The Press: Sean, is the President the target of a",3331.695,1.434
counter-intelligence investigation?,3333.129,2.77
Mr. Spicer: I think that&amp;#39;s what we need to find out.,3335.899,3.57
There&amp;#39;s obviously a lot of concern.,3339.469,1.401
"I mean, I mentioned to John there was",3340.87,2.002
considerable concern last cycle when a reporter was,3342.872,2.536
the target of one.,3345.408,2.936
But part of the reason that we have asked the,3348.344,1.135
House and the Senate to look into this is,3349.479,1.868
because of that.,3351.347,1.369
And I think it was interesting.,3352.716,3.87
"I think if you look at last week, all of a sudden",3356.586,3.036
these stories that keep coming out about the,3359.622,1.869
"President and his links to Russia, it has continued",3361.491,3.47
"to be the same old, same old, played over",3364.961,2.236
and over again.,3367.197,0.3
The President has made clear he has no interest,3367.497,1.168
"in Russia, and yet a lot of these stories that come",3368.665,2.936
"out with respect to that are, frankly, fake.",3371.601,2.97
They are a series of fake allegations that at the,3374.571,2.536
"bottom note, &amp;quot;While there&amp;#39;s no evidence to",3377.107,2.068
"substantiate any of this,&amp;quot; it&amp;#39;s the same unnamed",3379.175,2.136
"sources, &amp;quot;associates&amp;quot; that we get tagged with, and",3381.311,4.171
yet there is no evidence that continues,3385.482,2.235
to be shown.,3387.717,0.601
And every single person that gets briefed on this,3388.318,2.803
"shows that -- whether it&amp;#39;s Senator Cotton, Chairman",3391.121,2.802
"Nunes, who has done a phenomenal job of trying",3393.923,2.636
to get to the bottom of this.,3396.559,1.135
"But it&amp;#39;s interesting, I think the double standard",3397.694,2.169
that exists between the concern about getting to,3399.863,2.869
the bottom of the allegations that -- with,3402.732,1.735
"respect to the President, that there are so many",3404.467,4.104
other issues.,3408.571,1.068
When you talk about --   ,3409.639,1.735
The Press: So he doesn&amp;#39;t know,3411.374,0.601
whether he is the target of a probing?,3411.975,1.268
Mr. Spicer: But I think that&amp;#39;s one of the issues,3413.243,1.902
that we have asked the Senate and,3415.145,1.334
House to look into.,3416.479,0.567
I can tell you with respect to the other,3417.046,1.635
"instances, you look at former DNI Clapper&amp;#39;s",3418.681,2.77
"comments, he literally said, the DNI -- he said,",3421.451,2.436
"&amp;quot;The DNI, which includes the NSA, FBI and CIA, did",3423.887,4.371
not find any evidence of collusion between the,3428.258,1.801
Trump campaign and Russian agents.&amp;quot;,3430.059,1.902
"Senators Rubio, Cotton, Burr, Chairman Nunes --",3431.961,3.838
all of the people who have been briefed on this,3435.799,1.701
situation have come to the same conclusion.,3437.5,2.236
And it is interesting how many times this fake,3439.736,3.703
narrative gets repeated over and over and over,3443.439,2.603
"again, and yet no evidence has ever been suggested",3446.042,4.004
that shows the President has anything to do with,3450.046,2.202
any of the things that are written.,3452.248,1.101
It&amp;#39;s a recycled story over and over and over again.,3453.349,3.237
"And I think that there&amp;#39;s a bit of -- it&amp;#39;s amazing,",3456.586,5.372
"the President goes out last week, does this joint",3461.958,1.368
"session, and then literally 24 hours,",3463.326,3.237
stories start getting recycled about potential,3466.563,2.736
issues that come up that literally continue to,3469.299,2.269
"offer no fact, nothing but the unsubstantiated rumors",3471.568,3.57
over and over again.,3475.138,0.867
"And yet, what is ignored is when you have someone",3476.005,2.903
like former DNI Clapper go out and literally say that,3478.908,2.87
they &amp;quot;did not find any evidence of collusion,3481.778,3.27
between the Trump campaign and [Russian] agents.&amp;quot;,3485.048,1.535
"You have Rubio, Cotton, Nunes all say the same",3486.583,3.37
thing that they&amp;#39;ve been briefed that there&amp;#39;s,3489.953,1.501
nothing -- and yet this fake narrative --,3491.454,2.102
"The Press: Sorry, just want to make sure that",3493.556,0.768
I&amp;#39;m understanding you.,3494.324,0.467
Are you saying that there is a possibility he is the,3494.791,2.569
target of a counter-intelligence probe,3497.36,2.002
involving Russia?,3499.362,0.901
Because you just connected those two things.,3500.263,1.668
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, no.",3501.931,0.467
I think what I&amp;#39;m saying is that there is a difference,3502.398,1.735
between that narrative and then the narrative that,3504.133,2.737
has been perpetuated over and over again.,3506.87,2.002
The concern that the President has and why he,3508.872,2.302
asked the Senate and House intelligence committees to,3511.174,1.768
look into this is to get to the bottom of what may,3512.942,4.071
or may not have occurred during the 2016 election.,3517.013,2.536
"But the interesting -- Margaret, is that when you",3519.549,1.968
look at every single person that&amp;#39;s been,3521.517,1.702
"briefed, they&amp;#39;ve all come to the same conclusion --",3523.219,3.27
that nothing happened during the 2016 election,3526.489,2.469
tying him to Russia.,3528.958,2.503
And yet the fake narrative continues over and over,3531.461,2.803
"and over again, and the idea that it has to -- it",3534.264,2.836
"continues to be recycled without any substance,",3537.1,2.769
"without any evidence, needs to stop. Yes.",3539.869,2.669
The Press: The President said he was tapped.,3542.538,1.635
The Press: He said his wires were tapped.,3544.173,1.402
The Press: He said this as a fact.,3545.575,2.936
"Mr. Spicer: I understand that, and that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re --",3548.511,1.235
The Press: So you&amp;#39;re saying he doesn&amp;#39;t know,3549.746,0.967
whether he was wiretapped?,3550.713,0.868
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, no, that&amp;#39;s not what I said was --",3551.581,1.134
"The Press: Well, he doesn&amp;#39;t know he&amp;#39;s the",3552.715,1.702
target of an investigation.,3554.417,2.069
The Press: That his wires were tapped.,3556.486,0.801
"Mr. Spicer: Hold on, one at a time.",3557.287,0.967
I said that the President made clear on Sunday that,3558.254,3.27
he has asked the House and the Senate intelligence,3561.524,1.769
committees to use their resources and their,3563.293,2.469
processes to examine the facts and come to,3565.762,2.335
a conclusion. Chris.,3568.097,1.836
The Press: Since you&amp;#39;re talking about whether,3569.933,2.602
"things are true or not, let me ask you --",3572.535,1.635
"following up on something yesterday, you seemed to",3574.17,3.337
acknowledge that the President was wrong when,3577.507,1.735
he tweeted that 122 prisoners released by the,3579.242,2.436
Obama administration from Gitmo had returned,3581.678,2.469
to the battlefield.,3584.147,0.867
"In fact, it was mostly by the Bush administration.",3585.014,5.072
"Will he retract, or even apologize for that, given",3590.086,2.97
that he also called it a &amp;quot;terrible decision&amp;quot; by the,3593.056,2.669
"Obama administration, and given that",3595.725,2.736
that was incorrect?,3598.461,1.301
That there still has been no proof either of his,3599.762,2.77
tweets about widespread voter fraud,3602.532,2.969
or the wiretapping?,3605.501,1.635
Does the President have a credibility problem?,3607.136,2.336
"Mr. Spicer: No, look, I said yesterday -- I think",3609.472,1.368
Trey asked the question -- that the President meant,3610.84,2.836
the total number of people.,3613.676,2.836
The Press: But he said the Obama administration.,3616.512,1.902
"Mr. Spicer: I understand that, I&amp;#39;m",3618.414,1.702
actually explaining it.,3620.116,1.468
That&amp;#39;s why you asked the question.,3621.584,1.001
He meant that the total number of people released,3622.585,4.705
from Gitmo was 122.,3627.29,3.036
"What the President -- but just to be clear, there&amp;#39;s",3630.326,2.302
"a big difference -- under the Bush administration,",3632.628,1.836
most of those were court ordered.,3634.464,1.868
The Obama administration took great steps -- they,3636.332,1.869
"talked about -- it was a campaign promise, frankly,",3638.201,2.402
from day one to close Gitmo.,3640.603,2.603
This President is very clear that he understands,3643.206,2.002
the nature of the threat that the people in Gitmo,3645.208,2.803
"pose to our nation, and the recidivism rate that",3648.011,3.169
there are among people that we have released.,3651.18,2.269
That is a concern that he shares.,3653.449,1.669
The reason the Bush administration did it was,3655.118,1.835
in many cases they were under court order.,3656.953,1.635
The Obama administration made it actually a,3658.588,1.902
priority to let people go and to actively desire to,3660.49,3.937
close that camp and to release more and more of,3664.427,3.103
"those people, especially in the waning days.",3667.53,2.169
There is a huge contrast between the posture and,3669.699,4.104
the policy of the last two administrations on how,3673.803,3.136
they were dealing with Gitmo.,3676.939,1.402
This administration understands and the,3678.341,2.135
President has been very clear that he understands,3680.476,2.102
the people that are kept in Gitmo pose a danger to,3682.578,4.672
our country and to the rest of the world.,3687.25,2.636
"There&amp;#39;s a big, big difference between the",3689.886,1.368
posture of those two.,3691.254,1.301
The Press: Do you acknowledge that,3692.555,0.567
the tweet was wrong?,3693.122,1.068
Mr. Spicer: I just said it.,3694.19,0.767
I said that the tweet -- he meant that it was --,3694.957,1.802
the totality of the people.,3696.759,2.069
"That&amp;#39;s what I said to Trey yesterday, I&amp;#39;ll say it",3698.828,1.735
again to you today.,3700.563,1.301
Dave Boyer.,3701.864,1.101
The Press: So can I just follow up on something,3702.965,1.135
"else you said, Sean?",3704.1,0.934
"A totally different topic, because you said that",3705.034,1.869
"you&amp;#39;re in full -- you&amp;#39;re in sell mode, completely",3706.903,5.205
in sell mode.,3712.108,1.668
And I wonder if the President sees this as a,3713.776,3.17
"test of his ability to make a deal, something",3716.946,1.969
"that he really talked about, something that",3718.915,1.935
voters responded to on the campaign trail.,3720.85,3.604
"Is this essentially, does he feel, on him that this",3724.454,2.869
is him going to show the American people that he,3727.323,2.87
can get this deal done?,3730.193,1.635
"Mr. Spicer: Well, he gets -- he is a dealmaker.",3731.828,1.901
He&amp;#39;s a negotiator.,3733.729,1.502
He&amp;#39;s a world-class business leader.,3735.231,2.202
And he&amp;#39;s been highly successful at it.,3737.433,1.368
"So if anybody can get a deal on something, it&amp;#39;s",3738.801,2.069
going to be Donald Trump.,3740.87,1.401
That&amp;#39;s part of the reason I think that the American,3742.271,2.236
"people -- what they saw in him, that there was so",3744.507,1.868
much broken with Washington that when it,3746.375,1.902
came to the big problems -- whether it was,3748.277,1.635
domestically or internationally -- that if,3749.912,1.936
"somebody could come in and work across party lines,",3751.848,2.869
work with another country to get a deal that was in,3754.717,2.403
"the country&amp;#39;s best interest, he",3757.12,1.334
had that skillset.,3758.454,1.068
"And that&amp;#39;s why they, frankly,",3759.522,1.201
elected him President.,3760.723,0.768
So I think he feels very good about the product,3761.491,2.902
that we&amp;#39;ve put out.,3764.393,1.068
We are in sell mode.,3765.461,1.101
We want to get this done.,3766.562,1.502
But the President has an open mind.,3768.064,1.401
He enjoys meeting with people and hearing ideas,3769.465,1.702
"about how to make this country better, how to",3771.167,1.935
"create jobs, how to create a better healthcare",3773.102,1.902
"system, how to create better schools.",3775.004,1.802
And if there&amp;#39;s someone that comes up with a,3776.806,1.535
better idea that will help lower costs and increase,3778.341,3.904
"access, he&amp;#39;s certainly going to listen to it.",3782.245,2.302
Dave Boyer.,3784.547,0.901
"The Press: Sean, yesterday in the President&amp;#39;s meeting",3785.448,3.77
with the deputy whips he was talking about,3789.218,1.735
his tax cut plan.,3790.953,1.769
He said it&amp;#39;s going to be the biggest since Ronald,3792.722,1.435
"Reagan, maybe even bigger.",3794.157,1.801
"He said, &amp;quot;I know exactly what we&amp;#39;re looking at,",3795.958,2.469
most of us know exactly the plan.&amp;quot;,3798.427,1.769
So my first question is really easy.,3800.196,2.002
Tell us about the plan.,3802.198,1.568
Mr. Spicer: What the plan is?,3803.766,1.168
The Press: The tax cut plan.,3804.934,0.834
"Mr. Spicer: Well, again, I&amp;#39;m going to wait until --",3805.768,1.001
"thank you, I appreciate the layup, Dave.",3806.769,1.535
(Laughter.),3808.304,2.169
But I&amp;#39;ll leave it to him to work,3810.473,1.535
with Congress.,3812.008,0.467
"When we&amp;#39;re ready to roll it out, we will",3812.475,1.735
do just that.,3814.21,1.768
"We&amp;#39;re not there yet, so let&amp;#39;s go on with the",3815.978,3.304
next hopefully --,3819.282,1.001
"The Press: Secondly, building on",3820.283,2.402
"these jobs numbers today that look very positive,",3822.685,3.637
obviously there&amp;#39;s a lot of CEOs out there who are,3826.322,1.902
excited about the possibility of a tax cut,3828.224,1.935
"plan, and yet the President has also",3830.159,2.97
expressed a lot of concern about the national debt.,3833.129,2.969
If you&amp;#39;re going to get a tax cut on the level of,3836.098,3.737
"Ronald Reagan, a historic-sized tax cut,",3839.835,2.703
"how are you going to do that, balance the needs",3842.538,2.102
for continued job growth with the concerns,3844.64,3.203
about the debt?,3847.843,0.935
Mr. Spicer: Because I think that one of the best,3848.778,3.236
ways to get the national debt down is to,3852.014,2.77
grow the economy.,3854.784,1.301
"The more the economy is growing, the more we can",3856.085,2.269
"get it at three, four, five percent, the more the",3858.354,2.97
deficit goes down.,3861.324,1.401
That&amp;#39;s just the best way to tackle the deficit is,3862.725,2.803
"to grow the economy, put people back to work,",3865.528,2.169
create a deeper manufacturing base.,3867.697,1.601
"I mean, that is -- between that and some of the",3869.298,3.103
efforts that the President has put in to make,3872.401,1.669
"government more efficient and effective, and save",3874.07,3.937
"money at that level, those are the two things that I",3878.007,2.402
think combine to get the deficit down. Jennifer.,3880.409,3.971
"Mr. Spicer: Hi, Sean.",3884.38,2.169
"Of the more than 13,000 Syrian refugees who are in",3886.549,3.537
"this country, less than 150 of them are Christian,",3890.086,4.07
"Shia, or Yazidis -- the same groups that the U.S.",3894.156,2.303
government acknowledges are literally being at,3896.459,2.803
risk of being wiped off the map.,3899.262,1.701
"So I wonder, now that Secretary Tillerson has",3900.963,2.102
had time to settle in and as you review the refugee,3903.065,3.704
"program, immigration policy, is this something",3906.769,2.87
that&amp;#39;s being discussed?,3909.639,1.234
Is this a priority to give these groups some relief?,3910.873,2.069
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think that you know that when we",3912.942,3.236
"talked the first time about the executive order,",3916.178,2.136
it was something that we acknowledged.,3918.314,1.835
There is definitely an area where -- in the,3920.149,3.67
"executive order that we just passed, one of the",3923.819,3.27
areas that we talked about was -- and I&amp;#39;d have to go,3927.089,3.337
"back and look at the exact phraseology, but we",3930.426,1.735
"recognize that certain groups, and they can be",3932.161,2.469
"religious in nature, are being persecuted, and I",3934.63,2.77
think that that&amp;#39;s going to be a factor on how we look,3937.4,2.669
at that program.,3940.069,1.168
"It&amp;#39;s something that the President, as you",3941.237,1.001
"mentioned, he&amp;#39;s talked about in the past.",3942.238,1.935
It&amp;#39;s something that Secretary Tillerson has,3944.173,1.668
acknowledged.,3945.841,0.668
And that&amp;#39;s not just refugees coming into this,3946.509,1.668
"country, but I think one of the reasons that we",3948.177,1.435
need safe havens in Syria is to make sure that,3949.612,2.769
"groups and individuals, whether they be part of a",3952.381,3.07
group or religion who are being persecuted have a,3955.451,3.203
degree of safety that they can count on.,3958.654,3.937
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",3962.591,0.534
"Appreciate it -- Mr. Spicer: No, no.",3963.125,1.969
"The Press: Mike, Maria.",3965.094,1.435
"The Press: Right here, thank you.",3966.529,0.6
"Mr. Spicer: It&amp;#39;s International Women&amp;#39;s Day, Mike.",3967.129,1.368
The Press: Exactly.,3968.497,0.935
Thank you so much.,3969.432,2.035
So the President is on the record saying that he,3971.467,2.469
supports some sort of legalization for many of,3973.936,3.637
the undocumented people in the country.,3977.573,2.903
And you know there&amp;#39;s a DREAMer that was caught in,3980.476,2.102
"the raids in Seattle, Washington.",3982.578,2.469
We don&amp;#39;t know if he is going to be,3985.047,0.734
released or not.,3985.781,1.068
Does the President want to or plan to meet with,3986.849,4.304
DREAMers to talk about what&amp;#39;s on his mind about,3991.153,2.77
gathering ideas for some sort of legalization?,3993.923,3.87
"And if so, when would that meeting occur?",3997.793,2.736
"Mr. Spicer: The President, I think, has talked about",4000.529,3.804
"how he wants to tackle this holistically, and",4004.333,3.637
"back to Chris&amp;#39;s question a second ago, I think he has",4007.97,2.302
made clear that if there&amp;#39;s someone who has the,4010.272,3.537
"ability to strike a deal, to get people in a room",4013.809,2.836
"and acknowledge well, we have to stay true to our",4016.645,2.103
"principles, that we can get a deal on a way to fix",4018.748,3.87
"our broken immigration problem, it is him.",4022.618,2.169
We are not at that phase yet.,4024.787,1.702
This is something that he has talked to senators,4026.489,1.434
"about, and I think that, as we continue to move",4027.923,4.738
"forward, obviously, the focus now is on Obamacare,",4032.661,2.336
repealing and replacing it with this program.,4034.997,3.37
But it is something that we&amp;#39;re going to continue to,4038.367,1.502
"move forward with, and as a comprehensive thing --",4039.869,2.502
"not just the illegal issue, but the visa issue,",4042.371,4.471
how we deal with the other folks that are,4046.842,1.835
in this country.,4048.677,1.435
"But stay tuned, we&amp;#39;ve got more to go on this.",4050.112,2.236
We&amp;#39;ll go further.,4052.348,1.435
What&amp;#39;s that?,4053.783,0.834
The Press: No meeting on the works with DREAMers?,4054.617,1.535
Mr. Spicer: There is nothing on the schedule,4056.152,1.768
at this point.,4057.92,0.434
The Press: I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;re aware of reports that the,4058.354,2.169
President had ordered the Pentagon to step up the,4060.523,4.471
attacks on al Qaeda in Yemen.,4064.994,3.17
Does this mark a new strategy rather?,4068.164,4.404
And does the President delegate now to the,4072.568,2.569
Pentagon attacks on either ISIS or al Qaeda?,4075.137,4.838
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think the President talked about",4079.975,2.403
"this a lot during the campaign, about giving the",4082.378,2.502
authority and trusting the generals and the,4084.88,4.104
decision-makers of his national security team,4088.984,3.771
"with executing what they need to, to prosecute the",4092.755,3.403
war on terror and the war against radical,4096.158,2.536
Islamic terrorism.,4098.694,1.135
So it&amp;#39;s not a question of delegating authority.,4099.829,2.502
There are certain things -- and we addressed this,4102.331,1.201
in the briefing in previous weeks -- but,4103.532,2.069
there&amp;#39;s a big difference.,4105.601,1.201
"He&amp;#39;s not delegating the authority, but making sure",4106.802,2.436
that they have the ability and the timeliness to act,4109.238,3.07
in an appropriate manner to prosecute the case and,4112.308,4.671
to go after terrorists in a way that they probably,4116.979,2.436
weren&amp;#39;t last time.,4119.415,1.902
"So I mean, there is a big difference between the",4121.317,1.501
approach of this President and the last,4122.818,1.802
administration in terms of giving the generals and,4124.62,3.804
the leaders in the national security team and,4128.424,2.135
the Defense Department the tools and authority they,4130.559,2.236
need to prosecute the case against ISIS. Sarah.,4132.795,3.47
"Gabby, sorry.",4136.265,1.268
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",4137.533,1.168
You&amp;#39;ll get it one day.,4138.701,0.767
Mr. Spicer: I know.,4139.468,0.434
You guys switch.,4139.902,1.234
The Press: Israel&amp;#39;s defense minister said,4141.136,2.002
yesterday that U.S.,4143.138,1.602
officials had sent a direct warning to Prime,4144.74,2.102
Minister Netanyahu against annexing parts,4146.842,4.004
of the West Bank.,4150.846,1.435
I wanted to know if that was at the request of,4152.281,1.768
President Trump.,4154.049,1.168
"And then also, if you could tell us where the",4155.217,2.102
White House is in terms of reaching a deal with,4157.319,2.403
Israel on what they consider permissible,4159.722,2.102
settlement construction.,4161.824,2.536
"Mr. Spicer: Well, as you know, yesterday, the",4164.36,1.268
President spoke with Prime Minister Netanyahu.,4165.628,1.201
That conversation largely had to deal with areas of,4166.829,4.304
regional security.,4171.133,2.536
I don&amp;#39;t have anything further to readout on,4173.669,1.501
"that, and I know that when they met here at the White",4175.17,2.103
"House, there was discussion of settlements,",4177.273,4.104
and the President was very clear about what his,4181.377,2.969
desires and his wishes were.,4184.346,1.569
I think as we continue to follow up with Israel in,4185.915,1.935
"the coming weeks, we will have more on that.",4187.85,3.503
The Press: Thank you.,4191.353,0.968
Ronica Cleary with Fox 5.,4192.321,1.134
I have a follow-up question to actually his,4193.455,1.535
asking about the thousands of women who have chosen,4194.99,3.07
"to strike today, and you saying that it",4198.06,1.935
is a free country.,4199.995,1.268
"But at Channel 5, we&amp;#39;ve reported quite a bit on",4201.263,2.436
the schools and the districts that are closing,4203.699,3.036
because so many women chose to strike today.,4206.735,3.103
"So it is a free country, but what would be the",4209.838,3.304
"President&amp;#39;s reaction to, if you will, what is more",4213.142,2.903
important; the students being at school today or,4216.045,3.136
the woman&amp;#39;s right to strike and kind of make a,4219.181,3.337
"statement, if you will, on this day?",4222.518,2.302
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, thanks, Ronica.",4224.82,0.901
I think it&amp;#39;s an important question.,4225.721,1.201
"I mean, you&amp;#39;ve -- I know, locally, this affects a",4226.922,2.069
lot of individuals throughout Northern,4228.991,1.768
Virginia and Maryland and the District.,4230.759,2.236
"So look, I think -- I haven&amp;#39;t talked to the",4232.995,3.77
President specifically about this.,4236.765,1.335
"Obviously, as I mentioned, people have a right to",4238.1,1.869
"express themselves under our First Amendment, as",4239.969,4.604
the President is doing today by making sure that,4244.573,2.636
we appropriately salute the contributions that,4247.209,2.803
women make to this country.,4250.012,1.401
But there&amp;#39;s clearly an impact in the case of,4251.413,1.936
"schools -- localities throughout the country,",4253.349,3.169
"here in the greater Washington, D.C. area.",4256.518,1.836
But I think that that concern is best utilized,4258.354,3.603
by parents through their local school boards and,4261.957,2.336
"through their city councils and mayors,",4264.293,2.936
whether or not they found it appropriate for,4267.229,3.27
that to occur.,4270.499,1.768
"I have not spoken to the President about this, but",4272.267,1.736
I think there&amp;#39;s a balance.,4274.003,0.867
And I think that -- I would hope that we should,4274.87,3.437
use this opportunity to recognize the role of,4278.307,4.204
"women in the workplace, in the family, and throughout",4282.511,2.703
society for the contributions that they,4285.214,2.302
continue to make and have made in the past in making,4287.516,3.003
the country as great as it has.,4290.519,1.335
"So with that, one last thing, just to clarify.",4291.854,2.402
"I think Jill asked this, but I just want to be",4294.256,1.835
"really clear on one point, which is, there is no",4296.091,2.836
reason that we should -- that we have to think that,4298.927,2.803
the President is the target of any,4301.73,1.435
investigation whatsoever.,4303.165,2.169
"I&amp;#39;m sorry, that was Margaret.",4305.334,0.934
I apologize.,4306.268,2.403
The Press: Specifically counterintelligence.,4308.671,0.9
"Mr. Spicer: Right, and there is no reason to",4309.571,1.368
believe that he is the target of,4310.939,2.036
any investigation.,4312.975,2.235
"I think that&amp;#39;s a very important point to make,",4315.21,2.236
and so -- ,4317.446,1.501
The Press: So retract your previous --,4318.947,0.868
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, no.",4319.815,0.534
It doesn&amp;#39;t -- what I&amp;#39;m saying is -- hold on.,4320.349,2.269
The one question dealt with whether or not the,4322.618,2.536
"tweet dealt with wiretaps during the thing, the",4325.154,2.302
other is an investigation.,4327.456,1.535
"They are two separate issues, and there is no",4328.991,2.936
reason to believe that there is any type of,4331.927,2.002
investigation with respect,4333.929,2.202
to the Department of Justice.,4336.131,1.135
"Thank you, guys.",4337.266,0.967
I&amp;#39;ll see you tomorrow.,4338.233,1.335
Thank you. See you guys --,4339.568,1.001
The Press: -- leaks?,4340.569,1.635
Mr. Spicer: Not that -- I can&amp;#39;t comment.,4342.204,1.001
"Thank you, guys.",4343.205,0.367
