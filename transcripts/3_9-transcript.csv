"Mr. Spicer: Good morning, everyone.",2.936,1.568
The Press: Afternoon.,4.504,0.601
Mr. Spicer: Thank you.,5.105,0.5
Appreciate the --,5.605,1.935
John Roberts fact-checking from the seat.,7.54,2.036
(Laughter.),9.576,2.235
Good morning -- good afternoon.,11.811,1.502
(Laughter.),13.313,0.7
"It&amp;#39;s not my fault, it&amp;#39;s on the paper.",14.013,2.269
After receiving his daily intelligence briefing this,17.584,1.768
"morning, the President led a National Economic",19.352,2.369
Council listening session with CEOs of small,21.721,3.003
and community banks.,24.724,1.502
"Since 2008, the number of small banks has",26.226,2.302
declined 30 percent.,28.528,2.436
The dramatic increase in regulation following the,30.964,2.335
financial crisis has been a major driving force in,33.299,3.204
the decline of these banks.,36.503,1.835
"Dodd-Frank alone has resulted in 22,000 pages",38.338,3.403
of new regulations.,41.741,1.702
While large banks can hire armies of compliance,43.443,2.169
officers whose sole purpose it is to ensure,45.612,2.836
"they meet the ever-growing number of regulations, it",48.448,2.869
increases the cost of doing business for,51.317,1.802
"community banks, leading some not to engage in some",53.119,3.003
"forms of lending, or simply due to the time and",56.122,3.137
costs involved.,59.259,1.268
Our community banks are key funding sources for,60.527,2.102
"small-business owners, entrepreneurs, farmers and",62.629,3.136
"ranchers across the country, many of whom",65.765,2.369
can&amp;#39;t qualify for traditional loans.,68.134,2.77
They provide approximately half of all loans to,70.904,2.102
small businesses.,73.006,1.268
By reforming the regulatory system so that,74.274,2.102
"it is efficient, effective, and",76.376,1.902
"appropriately tailored, we will stop treating these",78.278,2.702
critical institutions in our communities the same,80.98,2.603
as banks that have exponentially more in,83.583,2.536
"assets, enabling them to engage even more with",86.119,3.003
small businesses and entrepreneurs that,89.122,2.336
stimulate local economies.,91.458,2.002
The banks participating in this listening session are,93.46,2.068
members of the American Bankers Association and,95.528,2.269
the Independent Community Bankers of America.,97.797,2.736
A full participant list is available to those,100.533,2.269
who are interested.,102.802,1.201
Yesterday I noted the continued signs of good,104.003,2.436
"news in our economy in terms of hiring, and the",106.439,2.603
morning reports showed that consumer comfort has,109.042,2.602
risen to the highest level in a decade.,111.644,2.303
I&amp;#39;m sure last night you also saw the report that,113.947,2.168
illegal southwest border crossings are down by an,116.115,2.703
"extraordinary 40 percent, a significant deviation",118.818,3.07
even when you consider the seasonal trends.,121.888,2.436
These measures reflect that both the economy and,124.324,2.002
the border are already responding to the,126.326,2.269
"President&amp;#39;s agenda, even while we&amp;#39;re still in the",128.595,1.935
beginning stages of putting his,130.53,1.969
policies in place.,132.499,1.568
The country and the world are clearly ready and,134.067,2.002
waiting for the change that the President,136.069,1.902
campaigned on and is already delivering.,137.971,2.869
"Right now, the President is holding a legislative",140.84,1.769
affairs lunch with OMB Director Mulvaney and key,142.609,2.669
members of Congress on his plans for the federal,145.278,1.969
budget and repeal and replace that,147.247,3.036
we&amp;#39;ve talked about.,150.283,1.134
This is just the latest opportunity to continue,151.417,1.969
the dialogue between the President and members on,153.386,2.302
Capitol Hill on turning his ambitious,155.688,2.169
agenda into action.,157.857,2.169
The strong relationship between President and,160.026,2.302
congressional leaders will be key as the budget,162.328,1.869
process moves along.,164.197,1.735
"As Director Mulvaney has been saying, our budget",165.932,2.569
"blueprint will be released in mid-March, and the",168.501,2.369
President is working collaboratively with both,170.87,2.403
his Cabinet and Congress to create a budget that,173.273,2.669
keeps the President&amp;#39;s promises to secure the,175.942,2.102
country and make the most efficient use of,178.044,2.503
taxpayer money.,180.547,1.401
In attendance at the meeting from Capitol Hill,181.948,1.835
"are Senator Crapo, the Chairman of the Senate",183.783,2.169
"Banking Committee, Chairman Cochran; the",185.952,2.903

"Committee; Senator Mike Enzi, the Chairman of the",190.69,2.269

Freedom Caucus; and,210.376,1.368
Congressman Rokita of Indiana.,211.744,2.136
"Later this afternoon, the President will meet with",213.88,2.636
former Secretary of Commerce Pete Peterson.,216.516,2.536
Then the President has a meeting with Secretary of,219.052,1.868
Homeland Security Kelly and the Director of the,220.92,2.336
"CIA, Mike Pompeo.",223.256,1.134
"And finally, the President will make remarks to the",224.39,2.536
"Senate Youth Program around 4:00 today, a",226.926,2.536
tradition that began with President Kennedy and has,229.462,2.302
continued through every administration.,231.764,2.403
The President is honored to be speaking to this,234.167,1.735
distinguished group of young men and women who,235.902,2.269
are interested in pursuing careers in public service.,238.171,3.17
"I also want to mention that right about now, the",241.341,1.601
Vice President is giving the keynote remarks at the,242.942,2.703
Latino Coalition&amp;#39;s Policy Summit.,245.645,3.17
His remarks focus on the particularly negative,248.815,1.902
"impact of Obamacare on small businesses, many of",250.717,3.103
"who have been unable to hire more workers, or were",253.82,2.402
forced to scale down their operation due to high,256.222,3.036
taxes and burdensome requirements that were,259.258,2.036
imposed by the law.,261.294,1.902
The President is dedicated to improving the,263.196,1.701
"healthcare system for every American, including",264.897,2.536
small businesses owners who have especially been,267.433,2.203
suffered -- have had to suffer through complying,269.636,2.435
with thousands of pages of regulations and rules.,272.071,3.137
That&amp;#39;s exactly why he&amp;#39;s working with Congress to,275.208,2.769
"enact the American Health Care Act, which he was",277.977,2.269
glad to wake up this morning and see approved,280.246,1.668
by the House Ways and Means Committee.,281.914,1.769
"Also today, the President was pleased to see his",283.683,2.002
"Ambassador to Israel, David Friedman,",285.685,2.102
voted out of committee.,287.787,1.368
"We had hoped to see Seema Verma, who would be",289.155,2.769
confirmed as the administrator this week as,291.924,2.036
the administrator of Health Centers for,293.96,3.704
Medicare and Medicaid Services at the Department,297.664,2.802
of Health and Human Services.,300.466,2.069
"Unfortunately, Senate Democrats continue to",302.535,2.002
unnecessarily delay her confirmation.,304.537,2.469
At this critical time when we&amp;#39;re talking about,307.006,1.802
"healthcare, it&amp;#39;s ironic that they refuse to",308.808,2.102
consider someone with such amazing expertise,310.91,2.503
in this area.,313.413,1.268
Seema Burma has worked for over 20 years in,314.681,2.535
healthcare policy.,317.216,1.669
She has redesigned Medicaid programs in,318.885,1.701
"several states, including Indiana, Iowa,",320.586,2.57
Ohio and Kentucky.,323.156,1.801
"She&amp;#39;s worked with governors&amp;#39; offices, state",324.957,1.702
"Medicaid agencies, state health departments, state",326.659,2.903
"departments of insurance, as well as private",329.562,2.169
companies and foundations.,331.731,1.535
She&amp;#39;s unquestionably and uniquely qualified for her,333.266,2.669
"position, and especially now that health reform is",335.935,2.536
"at the top of the President&amp;#39;s agenda, it&amp;#39;s",338.471,2.069
time to get her in place.,340.54,2.502
This delay by Senate Democrats at this critical,343.042,1.635
time is unacceptable.,345.078,2.402
"On a scheduling note for the weekend, the Vice",347.48,1.969
President announced yesterday that he&amp;#39;ll be in,349.449,1.668
"Louisville, Kentucky on",351.117,1.168
Saturday with Governor Bevin.,352.285,2.102
The Vice President&amp;#39;s Office will have further,354.387,1.435
details for you on that trip as we get closer.,355.822,3.303
"Finally, I want to take a moment to acknowledge that",359.125,1.835
today is the 10-year anniversary of the,360.96,2.469
disappearance of Former FBI Agent Robert Levinson,363.429,4.305
"from Kish Island, Iran.",367.734,1.801
The Trump administration remains unwavering in our,369.535,2.236
commitment to locate Mr.,371.771,1.501
Levinson and bring him home.,373.272,1.869
"The Levinson family has suffered far too long, and",375.141,2.803
we will not rest until his case is resolved.,377.944,3.303
"And with that, I&amp;#39;ll take your questions.",381.247,2.302
Hallie Jackson.,383.549,1.769
"The Press: I got a couple of topics for you,",385.318,1.368
if you don&amp;#39;t mind.,386.686,0.834
Mr. Spicer: Of course.,387.52,0.534
The Press: Julian Assange says the CIA has lost,388.054,1.668
control of its entire cyber weapons arsenal.,389.722,2.97
Does the President agree?,392.692,1.601
"Mr. Spicer: I think, as we&amp;#39;ve commented before,",394.293,2.303
there&amp;#39;s grave concern that the President has about,396.596,3.003
the release of national security and classified,399.599,2.836
information that threatens and undermines our,402.435,2.369
nation&amp;#39;s security.,404.804,1.234
"Obviously, he believes that the systems at the",406.038,2.303
CIA are outdated and need to be updated.,408.341,3.637
"We are not commenting on the current situation,",411.978,3.203
as is U.S.,415.181,1.668
"government policy, but I think the situation",416.849,4.104
"technology-wise at the CIA, the President has",420.953,2.002
"acknowledged, needs to be updated.",422.955,1.735
The CIA put out a statement regarding the,424.69,1.535
"current situation, and I would refer you to that.",426.225,2.836
The Press: Follow-ups on that.,429.061,0.568
Is he going to talk about that with,429.629,1.067
Mike Pompeo today?,430.696,2.169
Mr. Spicer: He gets a daily briefing from the,432.865,1.302
"director, and I&amp;#39;m not privy to the contents of",434.167,3.069
"his discussion, but obviously issues of",437.236,2.269
"national security, including that, are",439.505,1.402
probably something that gets discussed.,440.907,3.403
The Press: And then some Republicans have said,444.31,1.335
Julian Assange should be imprisoned.,445.645,1.935
Does the President agree?,447.58,0.3
Mr. Spicer: I think the U.S.,447.88,1.402
government has had a position on Julian Assange,449.282,1.768
"is -- a position in the past, and I don&amp;#39;t see",451.05,2.136
anything that has changed that.,453.186,0.967
He has compromised in the past -- and undermined our,454.153,3.537
"national security, and I think I&amp;#39;ll leave it up to",457.69,1.902
the Department of Justice to further comment on,459.592,4.104
their disposition of him. John.,463.696,1.101
The Press: Second topic was on healthcare.,464.797,1.368
Mr. Spicer: Second topics?,466.165,0.768
The Press: Second of two topics.,466.933,1.401
"Mr. Spicer: It&amp;#39;s like an interview, not a",468.334,0.567
press briefing.,468.901,1.669
The Press: The President tweeted just a little bit,470.57,2.302
ago that he believes that healthcare is,472.872,1.268
coming along great.,474.14,0.901
We&amp;#39;ve also been watching Paul Ryan deliver a pretty,475.041,2.035
lengthy PowerPoint presentation --,477.076,2.236
Mr. Spicer: Very good PowerPoint.,479.312,0.734
The Press: -- seeming aimed at convincing,480.046,1.368
Republicans to get onboard this plan.,481.414,1.501
Isn&amp;#39;t that a sign that healthcare is not actually,482.915,1.702
coming along great?,484.617,0.901
Mr. Spicer: I think anybody who has been in,485.518,1.902
Washington for a few days or longer recognizes that,487.42,4.037
any major piece of legislation takes a,491.457,2.87
lot of explanation.,494.327,0.867
The President has been very committed to talking,495.194,3.27
to members of Congress.,498.464,0.734
He had another meeting last night.,499.198,1.568
"Something as complicated as this, that deals with",500.766,2.236
"one-fifth of our economy, that was a major takeover",503.002,2.603
"of our healthcare system, isn&amp;#39;t a simple thing.",505.605,3.003
"It&amp;#39;s a major, complicated piece of legislation",508.608,2.969
that&amp;#39;s got three prongs to it.,511.577,1.869
And this is the first one -- the reconciliation,513.446,2.803
piece that starts to chip away at finally,516.249,2.469
repealing Obamacare.,518.718,1.501
"When they passed Obamacare, they rushed it",520.219,2.77
so quick they gave the then-Secretary of Health,522.989,3.103
and Human Services great authority to enact,526.092,2.469
certain aspects of it.,528.561,1.001
"We now -- that would be our phase two, is having",529.562,1.968
Secretary Price go through the pieces of Obamacare,531.53,3.871
"that he has been given the authority to, when they",535.401,2.469
"passed it, to help unwind",537.87,1.668
a lot of the things they did.,539.538,0.801
And then phase three is stuff that has to be done,540.339,2.002
through other pieces of legislation that does,542.341,2.102
stuff like allow people to sell insurance across,544.443,2.369
state lines; that allows small businesses to pool.,546.812,2.203
So there&amp;#39;s a lot of facets to getting this pushed,549.015,4.07
"through, and I think that one of the things that",553.085,2.436
we&amp;#39;ve been able to do quite effectively is talk,555.521,2.569
"to members, especially in the House, but the Vice",558.09,2.803
President has been very active on both sides of,560.893,2.603
both chambers to communicate how this is a,563.496,3.603
comprehensive strategy in three prongs to repeal and,567.099,3.404
replace it with something more effective.,570.503,1.802
"The Press: -- for example, roll back Medicaid",572.305,1.801
expansion freezing until 2018?,574.106,1.402
Would he support that?,575.508,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Look, Hallie, I think this is going to",576.175,1.535
through the process of -- it&amp;#39;s working its way,577.71,3.103
"through Ways and Means today, there&amp;#39;s a mark-up",580.813,2.102
"in the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and I",582.915,3.537
think that&amp;#39;s where we are going to continue to see,586.452,1.935
"action -- in the House, and then when it goes to",588.387,2.836
the Senate the President will continue to engage,591.223,1.936
very actively with the House and the Senate,593.159,1.935
to get this done.,595.094,0.901
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",595.995,6.306
New York City First Lady Chirlane McCray said in a,602.301,2.436
statement that Donald Trump should keep his,604.737,1.935
"hands off women&amp;#39;s bodies, women&amp;#39;s healthcare, and",606.672,2.403
"Planned Parenthood, which has done just fine without",609.075,2.068
President Trump&amp;#39;s advice.,611.143,1.368
I wanted to know what the response from the White,612.511,1.769
House was on this.,614.28,0.934
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I mean, with respect to Planned",615.214,1.902
"Parenthood specifically, the President has been",617.116,3.437
very clear that he&amp;#39;s pro-life.,620.553,1.601
We&amp;#39;ve worked with them to talk about making sure,622.154,4.605
that there&amp;#39;s a difference between taxpayer funding,626.759,2.569
of abortion and women&amp;#39;s health services.,629.328,3.404
"We have, and the President has committed to making",632.732,2.369
sure that funds for women health community centers,635.101,2.469
is going to be reflected by a substantial,637.57,2.836
increase in his budget.,640.406,0.867
"He&amp;#39;s committed to doing that, and he&amp;#39;s trying to",641.273,2.369
figure out a way to make sure that the focus of,643.642,2.37
taxpayer money is spread towards community centers,646.012,2.869
"that provide vital health services to women, and",648.881,2.636
that we&amp;#39;re not using,651.517,0.767
taxpayer funds for abortion.,652.284,1.502
John Roberts.,653.786,1.435
The Press: I just want to follow on Hallie --,655.221,1.635
Mr. Spicer: Which one?,656.856,1.301
The Press: In an unrelated topic.,658.157,0.801
(Laughter.),658.958,1.168
Just so you&amp;#39;re prepared.,660.126,1.401
"On healthcare, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas today",661.527,2.536
"sent a series of tweets in which he basically said,",664.063,3.003
"this is dead on arrival in the Senate, go back to the",667.066,1.768
"drawing board, adding that it is absurd for the",668.834,2.703
committees to be voting on something that hasn&amp;#39;t even,671.537,2.102
been scored yet.,673.639,0.968
What does the President think of what Senator,674.607,2.536
Cotton said today?,677.143,1.268
Does he plan on having a conversation with him?,678.411,2.268
"Mr. Spicer: Well, we&amp;#39;re going to engage.",680.679,1.902
"He has talked to Senator Cotton, and will continue",682.581,2.336
to talk to any senator that has questions or,684.917,3.17
concerns or ideas.,688.087,1.702
It went through the Ways and Means,689.789,1.334
Committee last night.,691.123,0.935
I think they started at something like 10:15,692.058,2.469
yesterday morning.,694.527,1.868
It is an 18 --,696.395,0.567
The Press: Has he talked --,696.962,1.168
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t believe he has talked to,698.13,0.567
Senator Cotton.,698.697,0.468
He&amp;#39;s meeting with members right now.,699.165,1.401
"As I just mentioned, he had dinner last night",700.566,2.035
with Senator Cruz.,702.601,0.801
"He&amp;#39;s continuing to work both sides of the aisle,",703.402,2.202
both chambers.,705.604,1.035
"As I mentioned yesterday, I think you&amp;#39;re going to",706.639,1.368
"see a very aggressive, a very robust push.",708.007,3.603
We continue to have the team out talking to local,711.61,2.903
"media, local radio, op-eds placed, talking",714.513,2.069
to local leaders.,716.582,1.468
We believe that the more we talk about the,718.05,2.703
"comprehensive, three-prong approach that we have to",720.753,3.537
doing a lot of the things that conservatives have,724.29,2.402
"talked about -- to bring back cost containment, to",726.692,3.437
get people to be more patient-centered in the,730.129,2.235
"healthcare decisions they make, allow more choices",732.364,2.369
-- it&amp;#39;s going to bring people on board.,734.733,1.335
"But the thing that&amp;#39;s really interesting, John,",736.068,2.036
"about the current approach is that, no matter where",738.104,2.702
"you are, especially on the conservative side, you",740.806,3.437
cannot possibly believe that the current,744.243,2.336
healthcare system is an effective program.,746.579,3.303
It is a monstrosity.,749.882,1.335
It is a government gone wrong.,751.217,3.436
"And I think -- The Press: I hear that, but --",754.653,1.669
Mr. Spicer: And I think that we will continue to,756.322,2.736
engage with him and other members of the House and,759.058,1.802
"Senate that have ideas, but it&amp;#39;s going to continue",760.86,2.135
to work its way through the process.,762.995,1.335
"As I mentioned, it went through the House Ways",764.33,1.635
and Means Committee.,765.965,0.7
It&amp;#39;s currently going through the House Energy,766.665,1.635
and Commerce Committee.,768.3,1.135
"When the House passes it, and it goes over to the",769.435,1.635
"Senate, I&amp;#39;m sure Senator Cotton and other senators",771.07,2.869
will have an opportunity to have their say.,773.939,2.603
That&amp;#39;s part of the process.,776.542,1.802
"We welcome his ideas and his thoughts, as we do",778.344,2.202
with other senators.,780.546,0.667
But the President has continued to do tremendous,781.213,2.336
"outreach, and our staff has continued to do that.",783.549,2.769
"Mick Mulvaney has been on the Hill, Vice President",786.318,2.136
"Pence has maintained a very aggressive schedule,",788.454,2.569
"as well as other members of the administration, and",791.023,1.568
we&amp;#39;re going to get this thing passed with all of,792.591,2.202
their input and ideas.,794.793,0.968
The Press: Was the President aware that,795.761,3.904
Lieutenant General Michael Flynn was acting as a,799.665,2.603
foreign agent when he appointed him to be the,802.268,3.436
national security advisor?,805.704,0.668
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t believe that,806.372,1.768
that was known.,808.14,1.402
I would refer you to General Flynn and the,809.542,2.469
Department of Justice in terms of the filings that,812.011,1.935
have been made.,813.946,0.634
"The Press: Had the President have known that,",814.58,1.702
would he have appointed him?,816.282,1.034
"Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know, John.",817.316,0.801
That&amp;#39;s a hypothetical that I&amp;#39;m not prepared to ask.,818.117,1.968
I don&amp;#39;t know what he discussed prior to being,820.085,4.538
"appointed in terms of his background, his resume,",824.623,1.402
his client base.,826.025,1.635
I don&amp;#39;t know any of that.,827.66,1.368
"I know that, from what I have read, that he has",829.028,1.902
filed the appropriate forms with the Department,831.63,1.502
"of Justice, and I think you should ask him and",833.132,3.703
subsequently them if you have any questions about,836.835,2.236
this specific filing.,839.071,0.901
Jon Karl.,839.972,0.534
"The Press: Sean, just following up on Senator",840.506,1.835
"Cotton, he told me just a short while ago that he",842.341,3.003
believes that this bill might actually make things,845.344,3.737
worse than the current Obamacare.,849.081,3.07
What do you say to Senator Cotton?,852.151,2.269
"Mr. Spicer: I respectfully disagree, and I hope we",854.42,3.904
have an opportunity for the team to continue to,858.324,2.335
not only talk to him about what we&amp;#39;re trying to do,860.659,3.37
"and how we&amp;#39;re trying to do it, but that we&amp;#39;d love",864.029,1.669
to hear his ideas.,865.698,0.867
"I mean, this isn&amp;#39;t -- as I mentioned the last couple",866.565,2.269
days -- we&amp;#39;re not jamming this down people&amp;#39;s throat.,868.834,1.902
We&amp;#39;re welcoming ideas and thoughts.,870.736,2.369
We think this is a great vehicle to restore a,873.105,4.104
patient-centered healthcare bill to drive,877.209,2.97
"down costs, and I think Senator Cotton clearly",880.179,2.502
recognizes that the current version of,882.681,2.303
healthcare that is out there right now,884.984,1.501
is not sustainable.,886.485,1.668
And so we welcome his input into this process.,888.153,3.871
We think that the work that we&amp;#39;ve done prior to,892.024,2.869
putting this together with the House is something,894.893,2.57
"that reflects a lot of the best ideas, and we would",897.463,2.235
continue to welcome his input on this.,899.698,1.969
The Press: Are you open to major changes --,901.667,3.236
"Mr. Spicer: Hold on, Charlie.",904.903,0.534
It&amp;#39;s not -- I&amp;#39;m not open --,905.437,0.734
The Press: Is the White,906.171,0.701
House open to major changes or is it --,906.872,1.368
Mr. Spicer: I think the President has said before,908.24,1.935
he wants to hear members&amp;#39; ideas.,910.175,1.669
He believes that this bill encompasses the best of,911.844,3.003
ideas and the best way forward.,914.847,1.968
"But again, we&amp;#39;re going to let the process work its",916.815,1.702
will through the House and then subsequently,918.517,1.568
through Senate.,920.085,0.668
"And if members have ideas, we want to hear them and",920.753,3.803
want them to be part of it.,924.556,0.735
"This isn&amp;#39;t getting jammed through, and we welcome",925.291,4.137
"that, and that&amp;#39;s why the President continues to",929.428,1.268
meet with folks.,930.696,1.234
He met with individuals yesterday.,931.93,1.602
He going to go meet with them today.,933.532,1.435
He&amp;#39;s going to be hitting the road.,934.967,1.368
"He wants to hear members of Congress, outside",936.335,2.803
"groups, physicians, healthcare providers, patients.",939.138,3.737
But he wants people to have an input in this to,942.875,2.235
make sure that we have the best possible bill that,945.11,2.136
"serves their needs and that don&amp;#39;t look back, like",947.246,3.27
"we do now with Obamacare, and say, I wish was had",950.516,1.802
done this right.,952.318,1.067
"We&amp;#39;ve got a system that, frankly, isn&amp;#39;t working.",953.385,2.102
"And I think that, no matter where you are on",955.487,2.536
"the political spectrum, you have got admit that",958.023,2.436
"either you or a loved one, or a friend, or a",960.459,1.802
"colleague isn&amp;#39;t getting the care they deserve, or",962.261,2.402
isn&amp;#39;t paying what they thought they,964.663,1.335
would be paying.,965.998,0.667
And I think we have to do this right so that we,966.665,1.835
don&amp;#39;t look back the way we do now and regret the way,968.5,2.837
that it was done. Charlie.,971.337,1.501
The Press: Senate and House conservatives said,972.838,2.603
that they want sort of a return to a 2015,975.441,4.337
Obamacare repeal effort.,979.778,1.769
"If that effort landed on the President&amp;#39;s desk,",981.547,2.235
would he sign it?,983.782,1.769
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think the effort that is going",985.551,1.501
through right now is the vehicle that is what,987.052,5.005
people are on board with.,992.057,1.035
I think one of the things that we have to remember,993.092,1.968
"is that the process, this three-pronged process, is",995.06,3.037
done for a particular reason.,998.097,1.968
The reconciliation process -- which I know for most,1000.065,4.338
"people, it sounds like a very arcane,",1004.403,1.802
inside-baseball congressional term -- but,1006.205,2.702
it only allows for certain things to happen in,1008.907,2.403
that repeal process.,1011.31,1.301
And that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;ve been very clear -- and I think,1012.611,2.536
"Paul Ryan laid out, Dr. Price has laid it out,",1015.147,3.036
and Mick Mulvaney is laying it out when he goes,1018.183,1.702
up to the Hill -- that there&amp;#39;s a reason that we,1019.885,2.703
keep talking about it in three prongs.,1022.588,2.002
Because there are only so many things that you are,1024.59,1.902
legally allowed to do through the,1026.492,2.002
reconciliation process.,1028.494,1.534
"When the Democrats jammed this through, they did it",1030.028,3.404
in a way that they did it basically in two steps.,1033.432,3.203
"They jammed it through the reconciliation process,",1036.635,1.935
number one.,1038.57,1.001
"And number two, they gave broad authority to the",1039.571,2.136
Secretary of Health and Human Services so at the,1041.707,1.902
time -- that she could unilaterally do certain,1043.609,2.836
things with healthcare and implement certain things,1046.445,2.436
that we now have to undo in the same way.,1048.881,2.102
"What we&amp;#39;ve done that&amp;#39;s different, though, is",1050.983,1.802
"frankly, add a third prong, which allows for",1052.785,3.136
additional legislative vehicles that will go,1055.921,2.736
"through the House and then to the Senate, that will",1058.657,1.668
allow some of the core conservative principles,1060.325,2.069
"that we&amp;#39;ve talked about for, frankly, decades,",1062.394,2.236
"about allowing more competition, allowing",1064.63,2.369
"people to pool, allowing people to do things that",1066.999,2.836
we think will allow lower prices to come out,1069.835,2.469
of the process.,1072.304,0.934
And I think that&amp;#39;s a big difference in how -- The,1073.238,1.702
Press: So if a repeal lands on the President&amp;#39;s,1074.94,2.169
"desk, he would not sign it?",1077.109,1.601
"Mr. Spicer: It is going to land on his desk, because",1078.71,1.702
we&amp;#39;re going to go through this process.,1080.412,1.335
The Press: I mean repeal without replace.,1081.747,2.069
"Mr. Spicer: Well, again, I think the way that we&amp;#39;re",1083.816,1.901
doing now I think is the right and the responsible,1085.717,1.969
way to do this.,1087.686,0.934
This bill will land on the President&amp;#39;s desk.,1088.62,2.069
He will sign it.,1090.689,1.135
We will repeal Obamacare and we will put into place,1091.824,2.235
a system that will be patient-centered that will,1094.059,2.469
allow the American people to have greater,1096.528,2.002
choice and lower cost. Blake.,1098.53,2.002
"The Press: Sean, with the pushback that you&amp;#39;re",1100.532,2.002
"getting so far with healthcare, do you think",1102.534,3.57
it is realistic to have both healthcare and tax,1106.104,2.703
reform done in 2017?,1108.807,1.835
And I ask you that because Mitch McConnell was asked,1110.642,2.236
"about this day, and he talked about there being",1112.878,2.336
"certain constraints, and that the tax reform",1115.214,2.335
portion of it could be a 2018 item.,1117.549,2.87
Mr. Spicer: I think we feel very confident that,1120.419,1.168
we&amp;#39;re going to get a lot done -- continue to get a,1121.587,2.302
lot done this year.,1123.889,1.368
Tax reform is high on the President&amp;#39;s priority list.,1125.257,2.269
I think it&amp;#39;s high on the,1127.526,1.168
American people&amp;#39;s priority list.,1128.694,1.468
"And especially as April grows closer and closer,",1130.162,2.502
and people look down at their federal tax form and,1132.664,2.57
"realize how much they&amp;#39;re paying, and we see",1135.234,3.336
companies pledging to come back recognizing that,1138.57,3.27
these companies bought into the President&amp;#39;s,1141.84,3.07
vision and agenda to make America more tax and,1144.91,3.57
regulatory friendly so that they would create,1148.48,2.136
"jobs, manufacture more here.",1150.616,2.102
That&amp;#39;s something that he&amp;#39;s committed to.,1152.718,2.803
He understands how important it is.,1155.521,1.434
"Look, the President is uniquely qualified as a",1156.955,2.736
"businessman, a successful businessman, to understand",1159.691,4.605
what a good business climate does to job,1164.296,2.869
creation and to manufacturing.,1167.165,1.469
And I think his commitment isn&amp;#39;t just a campaign,1168.634,2.869
promise; it&amp;#39;s something that he has lived by for,1171.503,3.504
"decades now, understanding that that&amp;#39;s what spurs",1175.007,2.369
"economic growth, that makes one place more",1177.376,2.736
attractive to invest in or to hire more people,1180.112,2.436
or to grow jobs.,1182.548,1.234
"And so for him, this is deeply personal.",1183.782,3.036
And I think that you&amp;#39;re going to see Secretary,1186.818,2.837
Mnuchin and others work on the contours of that in,1189.655,3.436
the next several weeks.,1193.091,0.801
But we intend to maintain to the schedule,1193.892,1.935
that he laid out.,1195.827,1.302
The Press: The August portion is,1197.129,2.102
still the timeline?,1199.231,2.102
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s right. Eamon.,1201.333,1.501
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1202.834,0.935
"On drug prices, Congressman Elijah",1203.769,1.368
Cummings was here yesterday.,1205.137,1.134
He said that the President was enthusiastic about his,1206.271,3.437
deal to cut drug prices.,1209.708,2.269
Is the President enthusiastic about that?,1211.977,1.768
"And if he is, how much pain should drug companies",1213.745,3.17
be prepared to take here?,1216.915,1.201
Mr. Spicer: (Laughter.) Ironic that you&amp;#39;re talking,1218.116,1.502
about drug companies and pain.,1219.618,2.302
Maybe there&amp;#39;s a pill for that.,1221.92,2.803
The Press: Of course.,1224.723,1.068
Mr. Spicer: Yeah.,1225.791,1.101
"I think the President -- as you know, one of the",1226.892,4.204
reasons that he reached out to Elijah Cummings,1231.096,1.635
"initially is because they share that and I think,",1232.731,2.302
"frankly, yesterday came to a lot of other areas where",1235.033,1.969
I think that they can find common ground and,1237.002,1.435
work on issues.,1238.437,1.234
And I know that drug prices is something that,1239.671,4.004
he understands near and dear is helping many,1243.675,3.137
"people get the care that they need, but the rising",1246.812,3.303
cost is something that is -- so I think as we look,1250.115,2.669
"at the vehicle in terms of the specific legislation,",1252.784,2.369
they share a commitment to it.,1255.153,1.535
And I think that there will be continued,1256.688,2.369
follow-ups not just between Congressman,1259.057,1.936
Cummings but others as to what the best piece of,1260.993,2.469
legislation is and how we get that home.,1263.462,2.536
The Press: The Democrats said that they&amp;#39;re going to,1265.998,0.867
drop this bill in two weeks.,1266.865,1.802
Is the President prepared to push the Democrats on,1268.667,2.102
Capitol Hill?,1270.769,0.5
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t -- I think that&amp;#39;s a bigger,1271.269,1.836
conversation that we have to have with House,1273.105,1.768
leadership in terms of some -- maybe it is that,1274.873,3.337
right vehicle.,1278.21,0.667
Maybe Speaker Ryan and Leader McCarthy and,1278.877,4.004
Chairman Brady have other ways to achieve the same,1282.881,2.636
goal or work with Congressman Cummings.,1285.517,2.636
I don&amp;#39;t want to be prescriptive to the House,1288.153,2.936
"as to how they work their will, but I know that the",1291.089,1.735
President has a commitment to that topic and that he,1292.824,2.736
wants to work with Congressman Cummings and,1295.56,2.069
others who share that same commitment.,1297.629,1.368
John Gizzy.,1298.997,1.835
"The Press: Thanks a lot, Sean.",1300.832,0.634
Mr. Spicer: John Gizzy.,1301.466,1.468

(Laughter.),1303.869,1.001
Mr. Spicer: You&amp;#39;re both,1304.87,0.433
good-looking Johns --,1305.303,0.735

"The Press: All right, thanks.",1308.44,0.767
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",1309.207,1.635
Two questions.,1310.842,0.768
"First, a Japanese news service is reporting this",1311.61,3.703
morning that the President will have a meeting with,1315.313,3.504
President Jinping of China in April.,1318.817,2.369
Does this mean that there is a new meeting before,1321.186,3.504
their scheduled meeting at the G20 in July?,1324.69,2.369
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to comment on the,1327.059,2.535
President&amp;#39;s schedule or foreign leaders at,1329.594,1.769
"this time, John.",1331.363,1.268
I think I&amp;#39;ve pretty much gotten that one down.,1332.631,3.103
"So until I have something further for you, I&amp;#39;m just",1335.734,3.303
going to let you get on to your next question.,1339.037,2.102
"The Press: All right, thank you.",1341.139,2.336
Going back to the meeting and to your opening,1343.475,2.069
"statement about the banks, in the last campaign,",1345.544,6.139
candidate Trump campaigned hard on restoring the,1351.683,4.438

work with the Trump administration on,1379.01,2.737

Is there any plans for the President to meet with,1384.916,3.137
Senator Sanders?,1388.053,1.702
And is repeal of Glass-Steagall,1389.755,2.268
on his agenda?,1392.023,1.068
Mr. Spicer: There&amp;#39;s no current schedule to,1393.091,1.502
meet with him.,1394.593,0.567
"I&amp;#39;m sure that, as he has done with several other",1395.16,1.935
"members of Congress from both sides of the aisle,",1397.095,2.77
"that at some point, that will be scheduled.",1399.865,1.568
But we don&amp;#39;t have anything on the books for now.,1401.433,2.569
"But look, he&amp;#39;s shown -- and I think today was",1404.002,1.935
"another -- or yesterday was another example, today",1405.937,2.069
another example of his willingness to reach,1408.006,1.969
"across the aisle, his willingness to look into",1409.975,2.435
both chambers and not just business but labor unions,1412.41,4.071
and other industries where we can find common ground.,1416.481,2.002
And I think if Senator Sanders and others want to,1418.483,2.97
work with the White House on areas of ways that we,1421.453,3.003
"can improve the financial industry, we&amp;#39;re",1424.456,2.302
going to do that.,1426.758,0.667
The Press: Are you still committed to restoring,1427.425,1.936
Glass-Steagall?,1429.361,1.435
Mr. Spicer: Yes. Erin.,1430.796,1.134
"The Press: O infrastructure, can you",1431.93,2.002
"give a sense of timing, where it is on the",1433.932,2.102
"priority list, and if these new reports that say",1436.034,3.237
that the infrastructure in the nation is in really,1439.271,2.636
"bad shape, does that give it new urgency?",1441.907,1.401
Mr. Spicer: I think the President mentioned it in,1443.308,2.035
the joint address.,1445.343,0.734
I think we&amp;#39;re looking at a public partner private --,1446.077,3.07
a public-private partnership as a,1449.147,2.269
funding mechanism.,1451.416,0.801
There is a lot of work being done,1452.217,1.335
behind the scenes.,1453.552,1.534
And I don&amp;#39;t want to put a timeline on that.,1455.086,2.369
"Obviously, as I just mentioned to Blake, we&amp;#39;ve",1457.455,1.569
got -- we&amp;#39;re currently dealing with the repeal,1459.024,2.402
and replace of healthcare.,1461.426,1.368
I think we need to move on to tax reform.,1462.794,1.902
But that is definitely somewhere that is -- we&amp;#39;re,1464.696,2.269
trying to figure out how to move that vehicle.,1466.965,1.969
There will be further discussion of that as we,1468.934,2.869
get closer to the budget as far as where that,1471.803,1.602
fits into the piece.,1473.405,1.568
John Decker.,1474.973,1.401
"The Press: Thanks a lot, Sean.",1476.374,0.601
The President had this meeting last evening here,1476.975,1.735
at the White House with some conservative groups.,1478.71,2.202
"Out of that meeting, can you tell us whether the",1480.912,3.504
"President was successful in twisting arms, getting",1484.416,2.969
these conservative groups to back this particular,1487.385,2.303
healthcare bill?,1489.688,1.001
"And just separately, I see on the President&amp;#39;s",1490.689,1.935
"campaign website that there is an event, a",1492.624,3.804
"campaign-style rally planned in Nashville,",1496.428,2.602
Tennessee for next week.,1499.03,1.769
Can you confirm that?,1500.799,1.134
"And why did you choose Nashville, Tennessee?",1501.933,2.202
There&amp;#39;s a Democratic congressman that,1504.135,1.469
represents Nashville -- it&amp;#39;s Jim Cooper.,1505.604,2.602
Are you hoping to get some,1508.206,1.135
Democrats behind this bill?,1509.341,2.135
"Mr. Spicer: So in the first part of that, you",1511.476,1.668
saw a lot of the statements that came out,1513.144,1.502
last night from some of the various groups.,1514.646,1.768
They were very encouraging.,1516.414,1.802
Their guiding principle is we want to get to yes.,1518.216,2.369
"I think one of the things that&amp;#39;s really interesting,",1520.585,1.568
"and I addressed it earlier, is that there&amp;#39;s a",1522.153,2.703
"lot of members, a lot of interested parties, a lot",1524.856,5.539
of groups that haven&amp;#39;t fully heard the,1530.395,3.337
three-prong approach.,1533.732,0.934
And I think Speaker Ryan did a phenomenal job today,1534.666,2.369
of really laying this out.,1537.035,1.101
Dr. Price has done a good job.,1538.136,1.668
That people need to understand the totality,1539.804,2.57
and the comprehensive nature of this; that there,1542.374,2.402
are three pieces of it.,1544.776,0.968
And I think what happens sometimes is that the,1545.744,2.569
reconciliation piece of this gets lost as defining,1548.313,4.504
the totality of it.,1552.817,1.569
And people need to understand the two other,1554.386,2.135
"pieces that achieve many goals, that healthcare",1556.521,3.337
advocates and conservatives have fought,1559.858,1.902
"for, for a long time that allow great competition,",1561.76,3.136
that allow small businesses to pool those,1564.896,1.702
resources together.,1566.598,1.368
But there&amp;#39;s a lot of things that occur in phase,1567.966,2.836
two and phase three that help bring down cost and,1570.802,2.903
create greater choice.,1573.705,2.035
It&amp;#39;s amazing when you listen in to some of these,1575.74,2.336
"meetings how often people say, I didn&amp;#39;t realize",1578.076,2.469
"that, and I didn&amp;#39;t understand the full scope",1580.545,2.102
and totality of what the plan was.,1582.647,2.636
It&amp;#39;s very encouraging.,1585.283,0.934
And then I think they -- without getting into,1586.217,1.936
"details -- I think in a lot of cases, they&amp;#39;ve",1588.153,1.935
shared some ideas with the President that we might be,1590.088,2.803
able to find some common ground on.,1592.891,1.701
So we&amp;#39;ll take it one step at a time.,1594.592,3.037
Go ahead.,1597.629,0.667
The Press: On the campaign-style rally?,1598.296,1.769
Mr. Spicer: I would refer that question,1600.065,2.469
to the campaign.,1602.534,0.901
I think the President is going to be,1603.435,0.634
traveling next week.,1604.069,1.801
And then -- but there will be -- the details of that,1605.87,4.538
are listed on the campaign site.,1610.408,1.335
There is going to be I think additional travel,1611.743,2.336
announced for next week on the official side.,1614.079,2.168
And as we get closer to either the end of this,1616.247,2.036
"week or the beginning of next week, I&amp;#39;ll try to",1618.283,1.702
have more for you. Katie.,1619.985,0.8
The Press: The President promised to immediately,1620.785,2.536
terminate DACA when he got in office.,1623.321,3.103
It&amp;#39;s been nearly seven weeks tomorrow and he,1626.424,1.802
still hasn&amp;#39;t done it.,1628.226,1.368
Can you definitively say if he&amp;#39;s going to,1629.594,1.902
get rid of DACA?,1631.496,1.268
"And if not, is he giving them legal status?",1632.764,1.969
And what&amp;#39;s the plan for DREAMers?,1634.733,0.8
"Mr. Spicer: I think, Kaitlin, we&amp;#39;ve talked",1635.533,1.869
about the status of that and the -- and how many,1637.402,2.836
steps we have to go through on immigration.,1640.238,1.435
"In the past, I think we&amp;#39;ve made significant headway",1641.673,3.337
in achieving the President&amp;#39;s priorities of,1645.01,2.435
"starting the wall, driving down illegal immigration.",1647.445,1.869
The numbers that came out last night show that even,1649.314,2.469
"when seasonally adjusted, we see a 40 percent dip in",1651.783,2.236
the people crossing our Southern border.,1654.019,1.935
That&amp;#39;s a very promising sign.,1655.954,1.668
"That being said, the executive order, the",1657.622,2.336
second one -- there was a lot of effort put into,1659.958,2.769
making sure that that was rolled out effectively and,1662.727,2.169
achieved the goal of protecting the country,1664.896,2.169
that the President sought out to do initially.,1667.065,2.202
"So we&amp;#39;re continuing to take steps on immigration,",1669.267,3.036
both legal and illegal immigration.,1672.303,2.203
"And as I&amp;#39;ve mentioned in the past, we&amp;#39;ll have more",1674.506,1.968
as we go forward.,1676.474,0.834
The Press: So he does still plan to,1677.308,2.036
get rid of DACA?,1679.344,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I think the President has been very,1680.011,1.568
clear about how he plans to address immigration as,1681.579,3.037
"a whole, both legal and illegal. Katie.",1684.616,2.135
"The Press: Sean, the President is convening",1686.751,2.97
"with conservative groups, but there&amp;#39;s also",1689.721,1.234
opposition on the left.,1690.955,1.469
Does he plan to -- he brought bipartisanship to,1692.424,2.268
"Washington, finally.",1694.692,1.369
(Laughter.),1696.061,1.101
Does the President plan to meet,1697.162,1.101
"with groups like the AMA and AARP, which supported",1698.263,3.436
Obamacare but are not supporting this bill?,1701.699,2.069
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t -- it would be ill-advised for,1703.768,3.103
me to start saying who he is going to -- but I think,1706.871,1.302
that what we&amp;#39;ve shown over the last couple weeks is,1708.173,3.436
the President&amp;#39;s willingness to meet with,1711.609,1.635
"individuals, senators, groups.",1713.244,2.469
"So I don&amp;#39;t want to rule in who is going to meet, or",1715.713,2.269
"out, but I think that I&amp;#39;ve said before with respect",1717.982,2.803
"to members, and I&amp;#39;d say it again with respect to",1720.785,1.935
"groups, that I think if people have ideas that",1722.72,2.903
will help provide a more patient-centered,1725.623,2.47
"healthcare system that drives down cost, the",1728.093,3.003
President and the team here will be willing to,1731.096,1.835
meet with them.,1732.931,0.667
So I don&amp;#39;t want to be prescriptive in terms of,1733.598,2.035
telling them who they have to meet with.,1735.633,1.969
"Their day is pretty busy right now with the Hill,",1737.602,1.835
but I will get back to you on some of the other,1739.437,2.803
groups that they&amp;#39;re going to meet with and,1742.24,1.468
we&amp;#39;ll go from there.,1743.708,1.101
Brian.,1744.809,0.668
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1745.477,1.334
Two quick questions.,1746.811,1.302
"One, this morning at the National Press Club, a",1748.113,2.068
local business in D.C. filed a Superior,1750.181,2.937
Court of suit against the President in regarding,1753.118,3.303
Trump Hotel.,1756.421,1.101
And I don&amp;#39;t expect you to speak to that issue,1757.522,3.236
"specifically, but their feeling less that -- as",1760.758,3.471
much as this administration has,1764.229,1.167
"supported small business, couldn&amp;#39;t he divest himself",1765.396,2.57
from this and support small business,1767.966,1.701
in the district?,1769.667,1.402
First question.,1771.069,1.201
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m really not sure -- how would he -- in,1772.27,3.237
terms of what?,1775.507,0.5
"The Press: Well, there&amp;#39;s 25 small businesses,",1776.007,1.902
"restaurants, in the area, and they&amp;#39;re saying that",1777.909,2.069
the Trump Hotel is taking all that business,1779.978,1.401
away from them.,1781.379,1.568
And couldn&amp;#39;t he walk away from it and help out the,1782.947,1.802
small business in the district?,1784.749,1.301
"Mr. Spicer: Well, as far as the President&amp;#39;s --",1786.05,2.002
obviously the President has made very clear in,1788.052,2.236
that December press conference at Trump Tower,1790.288,2.035
he doesn&amp;#39;t have conflicts and he&amp;#39;s done everything,1792.323,2.536
in accordance with the guidance that was given,1794.859,2.97
and gone well beyond what he ever needed to do.,1797.829,3.637
"But obviously, you can&amp;#39;t -- your name is on certain",1801.466,3.003
things and that&amp;#39;s a very big difference in terms of,1804.469,3.47
some of the properties that he owns.,1807.939,2.469
But he understands the importance of,1810.408,1.335
small business.,1811.743,1.902
That&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re meeting with community banks this,1813.645,1.801
morning to talk about the lending that they need --,1815.446,3.003
"whether it&amp;#39;s small business, entrepreneurs,",1818.449,1.769
"farmers, ranchers throughout the country.",1820.218,2.469
He understands the role of small business in our,1822.687,4.004
"economy and how many jobs they provide, and I think",1826.691,3.337
he&amp;#39;s been a champion of it.,1830.028,1.835
"The Press: Second question was, in his speech before",1831.863,3.637
"Congress last week, he said it&amp;#39;s not too much to",1835.5,3.17
dream that at some point in time our -- and I&amp;#39;m,1838.67,2.836
"paraphrasing -- our feet could be on foreign soil,",1841.506,2.502
and I&amp;#39;m guessing other planets.,1844.008,1.769
"With the NASA budget being released yesterday, I",1845.777,2.369
"believe, is there a major initiative for this",1848.146,2.135
administration for space exploration?,1850.281,4.505
Or are we just talking dreams?,1854.786,1.268
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m going to let Director Mulvaney get,1856.054,3.303
"into the details of the budget next week, or",1859.357,2.936
whenever that -- I&amp;#39;m trying to remember,1862.293,1.368
the calendar here.,1863.661,1.669
But when the Director comes out he&amp;#39;ll talk about,1865.33,3.67
the specific funding levels.,1869,1.368
"As you know, we&amp;#39;re in the middle of this what we",1870.368,1.468
call passback provision where we&amp;#39;ve sent them,1871.836,1.935
from top -- numbers.,1873.771,1.168
They&amp;#39;re sending us back their recommendations and,1874.939,2.703
their observations and edits and questions with,1877.642,3.303
respect to their budget.,1880.945,0.834
So we&amp;#39;re going to take this one step at a time.,1881.779,2.336
The Press: When he said -- Mr. Spicer: Obviously he&amp;#39;s,1884.115,3.47
"very keen on America&amp;#39;s role in space, and I don&amp;#39;t",1887.585,2.936
want to get into specific budget priorities or,1890.521,2.336
numbers until we&amp;#39;re ready to release them. John.,1892.857,2.369
The Press: You called on me.,1895.226,2.269
"Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sorry, April.",1897.495,2.336
The Press: It&amp;#39;s very important.,1899.831,1.435
"Mr. Spicer: I know, I saw the hands.",1901.266,0.734
(Laughter.),1902,1.968
"The Press: So, Sean, just really",1903.968,0.734
"fast, following up on John, we&amp;#39;re seeing the",1904.702,1.702
campaign information for next week in Nashville.,1906.404,4.171
You said something about talk to the campaign --,1910.575,2.235
who&amp;#39;s the campaign?,1912.81,1.101
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;ll try to help get you a name.,1913.911,2.57
There is a campaign infrastructure,1916.481,1.334
still in place.,1917.815,0.701
It would be inappropriate for me to be commenting on,1918.516,3.137
campaign activities from the podium.,1921.653,2.235
"So there&amp;#39;s a website up, same one that was during",1923.888,2.636
"the campaign, and I would suggest that you",1926.524,1.568
utilize that.,1928.092,0.801
But I&amp;#39;m only here as an official in the government,1928.893,4.538
so I don&amp;#39;t want to get into that.,1933.431,2.302
"The Press: Now, yesterday, going to back to",1935.733,2.169
"Congressman Cummings, you talked about some other",1937.902,2.636
"issues that they talked about in that meeting,",1940.538,2.035
where they found common ground.,1942.573,1.969
I want to hit two issues.,1944.542,2.102
"The vote irregularities, voter fraud and voter",1946.644,2.202
suppression -- where does the President see this,1948.846,3.003
coming together.,1951.849,0.768
"We heard from Congressman Cummings, but where does",1952.617,2.202
he see -- we understand he&amp;#39;s saying that voter,1954.819,2.903
fraud is real when there are other people,1957.722,1.635
saying it&amp;#39;s not.,1959.357,0.934
But then there are factual documents and cases of,1960.291,3.804
voter suppression.,1964.095,1.435
So how is there a marrying of that in this,1965.53,2.702
President&amp;#39;s eyes?,1968.232,1.168
Mr. Spicer: I think that&amp;#39;s why he&amp;#39;s asked Vice,1969.4,0.968
President Pence to look into it.,1970.368,2.135
I would disagree with the ascertation of -- I think,1972.503,1.869
there&amp;#39;s also factual,1974.372,1.902
evidence of people voting illegally.,1976.274,4.371
We saw that in Texas a couple weeks ago and in,1980.645,2.502
other places.,1983.147,0.668
So part of the reason that he&amp;#39;s asked Vice President,1983.815,2.969
Pence to chair this task force is to,1986.784,1.402
look into the issue.,1988.186,1.134
"But we welcome input in other areas, and it&amp;#39;s an",1989.32,2.836
area that they&amp;#39;ll continue to discuss. Sara.,1992.156,1.769
The Press: I&amp;#39;m not done.,1993.925,1.902
"HBCUs, HBCUs.",1995.827,0.734
"Now, also, Congressman Cummings said that when he",1996.561,3.036
talked to the President and he brought up the,1999.597,2.669
"issue of funding for HBCUs, President Trump",2002.266,3.404
said to Congressman Cummings that the,2005.67,3.57
President did not ask for money.,2009.24,2.97
"Now, they came here, according to many of the",2012.21,2.169
"presidents that I&amp;#39;ve canvassed, they came here",2014.379,2.869
with the intent of -- the fact that they were going,2017.248,3.403
to get some money from this executive order.,2020.651,3.504
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t think the executive order is the --,2024.155,1.401
The Press: That&amp;#39;s what their belief was.,2025.556,2.97
But then what I understand is that there was talk,2028.526,2.369
about investment in these colleges from,2030.895,2.97
Steve Bannon.,2033.865,1.301
One president wrote this down saying that &amp;quot;we are,2035.166,2.703
looking for a plan from you to invest in HBCUs and,2037.869,3.837
we will execute it when we get it.,2041.706,2.402
"And they&amp;#39;re looking for full funding for Title 3,",2044.108,3.537
"Pell grant full funding -- fall, spring and summer,",2047.645,4.071
-- as well as a one-time $25 billion investment.,2051.716,4.337
What does this White House think about this plan that,2056.053,2.937
"they&amp;#39;re trying to give back to this White House,",2058.99,2.202
especially at a time when you&amp;#39;re looking at cutting,2061.192,2.002
domestic spending?,2063.194,0.5
"Mr. Spicer: I think, when they were here, we were",2063.694,2.303
pleased to roll out the executive order that,2065.997,3.17
talked about making historically black,2069.167,2.736
colleges and universities a priority in this,2071.903,2.102
"administration, moving that sort of point person",2074.005,3.703
into the White House so that we could coordinate a,2077.708,3.604
whole-of-government opportunities for -- we,2081.312,3.237
talked about this.,2084.549,0.734
Looking at the different educational opportunities,2085.283,2.736
"-- expand government, whether it&amp;#39;s health or",2088.019,3.47
investment in sciences or even stuff like ROTC and,2091.489,3.17
NROTC programs that are some of these that span,2094.659,2.803
out of the Department of Defense.,2097.462,1.334
But we&amp;#39;ve got to look at how we&amp;#39;re providing,2098.796,2.569
government assistance in a whole host of ways to,2101.365,2.403
historically black colleges and universities.,2103.768,1.668
I think the issue of funding will be properly,2105.436,2.836
"addressed in the budget, and at that time -- but",2108.272,2.369
obviously this is something that,2110.641,2.002
has been discussed.,2112.643,0.334
The President --,2112.977,0.367
The Press: Is the President&amp;#39;s request realistic?,2113.344,0.968
Is this funding realistic?,2114.312,1.268
"Mr. Spicer: April, I&amp;#39;m not going to negotiate the",2115.58,3.169
"budget from here, but I think that the President",2118.749,2.403
has been -- made very clear that the vital role,2121.152,3.103
that they play in our society.,2124.255,2.169
And I think he&amp;#39;s shown that initially by the,2126.424,2.769
"executive order that he unveiled, and we will have",2129.193,2.903
further information for you as we get,2132.096,1.502
closer to the budget. Sara.,2133.598,2.335
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",2135.933,0.801
Circling back to what you said about critics,2136.734,2.402
characterizing the budget reconciliation bill as the,2139.136,2.37
"entirety of repeal-replace, how",2141.506,2.469
quickly does the President want to see Republicans,2143.975,1.968
"move on phase three, the companion legislation?",2145.943,2.67
Does he envision those unfolding simultaneously?,2148.613,3.503
And then given the early opposition to the budget,2152.116,2.436
"reconciliation bill, does the President maybe want",2154.552,3.136
Republicans to recalibrate their strategy when it,2157.688,2.803
comes to that companion legislation?,2160.491,2.336
Mr. Spicer: I am not going to start to tell Speaker,2162.827,3.67
"Ryan or Leader McCarthy [sic] or the Whip,",2166.497,3.704
"Mr. Scalise, how to release and when to",2170.201,2.235
release legislation.,2172.436,1.435
But I think obviously we need to make sure that,2173.871,3.17
members and all Americans understand the totality of,2177.041,4.104
this so -- at a schedule that they see fit.,2181.145,2.202
And I&amp;#39;ll let them unveil that schedule that -- they,2183.347,3.904
talk about the totality of this plan and the,2187.251,2.202
comprehensive nature in all three prongs that make,2189.453,3.237
up the repeal and replace part of this.,2192.69,2.002
"It&amp;#39;s important I think, though, for people to",2194.692,2.135
understand that there&amp;#39;s a commitment to do all those,2196.827,1.836
things that we&amp;#39;ve talked about -- whether it&amp;#39;s,2198.663,1.701
pooling or -- across state lines.,2200.364,1.602
There&amp;#39;s a lot of principles and things that,2201.966,2.469
we&amp;#39;ve discussed that I think are important to let,2204.435,2.469
people -- to know about.,2206.904,1.902
The Press: What&amp;#39;s the assessment of the,2208.806,3.17
situation in Afghanistan?,2211.976,2.369
What is the assessment of the situation in,2214.345,0.767
"Afghanistan, because there have been a series of",2215.112,4.939
terrorist attack there?,2220.051,1.668
And does the President have plans to send,2221.719,2.069
additional troops to Afghanistan?,2223.788,1.935
Mr. Spicer: So on troops I&amp;#39;d refer you to the,2225.723,1.869
Department of Defense on that one.,2227.592,1.334
I think we are in the middle of a comprehensive,2228.926,3.47
review on our policy in Afghanistan that --,2232.396,3.938
working with our Afghan partners and the,2236.334,1.768
Department of Defense and our key military leaders,2238.102,3.504
to create an approach to address Afghanistan,2241.606,3.303
to defeat ISIS.,2244.909,0.801
So we&amp;#39;re in the middle of that process.,2245.71,3.47
When we have more we&amp;#39;ll update you.,2249.18,1.868
But I think the Department of Defense is probably the,2251.048,1.569
best place to go to get that.,2252.617,1.968
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",2254.585,1.368
"Today, hundreds of U.S.",2255.953,1.702
Marines were deployed to Syria.,2257.655,1.969
So I&amp;#39;m wondering how involved was the President,2259.624,1.835
"in that decision-making process, and is this part",2261.459,2.169
of his wider anti-ISIS strategy?,2263.628,1.868
"Mr. Spicer: Obviously, the President was made",2265.496,2.402
aware of that.,2267.898,0.668
This is something that was done in consultation.,2268.566,3.97
He understands the regional issues that need,2272.536,3.304
"to be addressed there, and, again, I would refer",2275.84,2.002
you back to the Department of Defense on that. Yeah.,2277.842,2.869
"The Press: Sean, thank you.",2280.711,1.168
I have a follow-up question to Hallie&amp;#39;s first,2281.879,2.169
set of questions on WikiLeaks. My question is --,2284.048,3.236
Mr. Spicer: I feel like,2287.284,0.735
"Hallie gets, like, eight questions --",2288.019,0.867
The Press: The Republicans are calling for Julian Assange,2288.886,2.069
to be in jail or be arrested.,2290.955,2.769
What about the tech companies that he says,2293.724,3.637
that he will work with to give them these CIA,2297.361,2.636
hacking techniques?,2299.997,1.435
Should there be any legal repercussions for tech,2301.432,2.069
companies willing to sort of embrace and use this,2303.501,3.236
"technology that you&amp;#39;re taking a stance against,",2306.737,5.005
if you will?,2311.742,0.634
"Mr. Spicer: So, number one, I&amp;#39;ll go back to the",2312.376,4.104
statement that we don&amp;#39;t comment on validating or,2316.48,5.005
authenticating allegations of this sort as the U.S.,2321.485,3.304
government -- in terms of U.S.,2324.789,1.201
government policy.,2325.99,1.101
I will say that the President obviously feels,2327.091,3.737
"deeply concerned about anybody, an individual or",2330.828,3.237
"anybody, that seeks to undermine the national",2334.065,1.801
security of our country.,2335.866,0.968
"I don&amp;#39;t want to -- stay within my purview here,",2336.834,4.338
but I do think that I would check with the,2341.172,2.102
Department of Justice in particular about -- if a,2343.274,3.437
"program or a piece of information is classified,",2346.711,3.003
it remains classified regardless of whether or,2349.714,2.836
not it is released into the public venue or not.,2352.55,3.036
And so I would just suggest that someone,2355.586,2.169
consult with them regarding the legal,2357.755,2.436
repercussions of any individual or entity using,2360.191,3.069
any piece of still-classified,2363.26,2.269
information or technique or product that hasn&amp;#39;t,2365.529,4.605
been declassified.,2370.134,0.834
There&amp;#39;s a reason that we have classification,2370.968,2.269
"levels, and that&amp;#39;s to protect our country",2373.237,1.335
and our people.,2374.572,0.667
"And that&amp;#39;s something that we have to maintain,",2375.239,4.371
regardless of how it&amp;#39;s thought out. Zeke.,2379.61,2.503
"The Press: Sean, two questions for you.",2382.113,1.034
"One, back to General Flynn, how concerning is",2383.147,2.669
it to the President and to the White House that a,2385.816,2.069
registered foreign agent was selected to become --,2387.885,3.537
was the national security advisor for a brief,2391.422,2.536
period of time?,2393.958,2.636
"Mr. Spicer: Look, I think this is what he",2396.594,3.17
did for a living.,2399.764,0.967
"And as the President said in the press conference,",2400.731,3.737
talking to individuals that are within the realm,2404.468,3.804
of the duties that you&amp;#39;re going to perform is part,2408.272,2.703
of your job.,2410.975,1.668
The Press: -- compensated for --,2412.643,0.868
"Mr. Spicer: I understand that but he was being compensated, he",2413.511,0.767
"wasn&amp;#39;t being compensated as part of the transition,",2414.278,4.471
as far as I&amp;#39;m aware.,2418.749,3.704
And so he was a private citizen at the time.,2422.453,3.003
"And when you&amp;#39;re a private citizen, you&amp;#39;re allowed to",2425.456,2.336
engage in legal activities.,2427.792,3.103
"I don&amp;#39;t have anything further on that, but I",2430.895,1.768
think there&amp;#39;s nothing nefarious about doing,2432.663,2.603
anything that&amp;#39;s legal as long as the proper,2435.266,1.635
paperwork is filed.,2436.901,3.069
"The Press: Sean, just real quick, it was just --",2439.97,1.101
several reports out of the State Department from our,2441.071,4.438
colleagues that on Secretary Tillerson&amp;#39;s,2445.509,1.835
"upcoming trip to Asia, he will not be taking any",2447.344,1.802
press with him on that trip.,2449.146,1.702
"That&amp;#39;s a breach of precedent, certainly of",2450.848,3.637
the last several bipartisan administrations.,2454.485,2.736
Is it concerning to the White House that the,2457.221,2.035
administration&amp;#39;s foreign policy might not be,2459.256,3.904
effectively communicated to the American public and,2463.16,0.934
around the world because there isn&amp;#39;t a press pool,2464.094,2.903
with the Secretary of State?,2466.997,1.068
"Mr. Spicer: This is the first I&amp;#39;m learning of it,",2468.065,1.969
"I&amp;#39;d be glad to follow up with you, Zeke.",2470.034,1.334
I don&amp;#39;t know that.,2471.368,1.268
I think you all know that we have been a very,2472.636,3.17
transparent administration in terms of access to the,2475.806,1.902
President and his activities here.,2477.708,1.768
I&amp;#39;d be glad to follow up with the Department of,2479.476,1.469
State and follow up -- that you can share that,2480.945,3.069
with your colleagues. Margaret.,2484.014,1.302
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",2485.316,1.701
Yesterday you said the President had no reason to,2487.017,2.536
believe there was any type of investigation with,2489.553,2.036
respect to the Department of Justice.,2491.589,2.736
Did the Justice Department give you that assurance?,2494.325,2.736
Because they&amp;#39;re telling The New York,2497.061,1.168
Times they did not.,2498.229,1.368
"Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not aware of it, but that&amp;#39;s my",2499.597,1.268
"point, is that we&amp;#39;re not aware of anything.",2500.865,2.369
The Press: -- been told by the Justice Department,2503.234,1.568
that there is no investigation.,2504.802,1.101
Mr. Spicer: No.,2505.903,0.534
"The Press: So there might be one, you",2506.437,1.168
just don&amp;#39;t know.,2507.605,0.667
"Mr. Spicer: Right, I said I&amp;#39;m not aware",2508.272,1.668
and we&amp;#39;re not aware.,2509.94,1.602
And that&amp;#39;s why we want the House and the Senate to do,2511.542,1.601
"what the President has asked of them,",2513.143,2.503
to look into this.,2515.646,0.667
"But, no, we&amp;#39;re not aware.",2516.313,0.668
The Press: To discover if there is an investigation.,2516.981,1.735
"Mr. Spicer: No, to look into the situation.",2518.716,1.501
"The Press: The Justice Department is saying,",2520.217,1.835
"though, that they never gave you the assurances",2522.052,1.802
that you gave us.,2523.854,0.667
Mr. Spicer: Okay.,2524.521,1.102
"No, the assurance I gave you, Margaret, was that",2525.623,1.768
I&amp;#39;m not aware.,2527.391,1.335
And that is 100 percent accurate.,2528.726,1.668
"The Press: So when you said, no reason to",2530.394,1.502
"believe, it was, I&amp;#39;m not aware if there&amp;#39;s",2531.896,2.502
an investigation?,2534.398,0.767
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s right. Right.,2535.165,0.768
"I mean, I don&amp;#39;t know that they&amp;#39;re not",2535.933,0.5
interchangeable.,2536.433,0.901
I&amp;#39;m not aware.,2537.334,1.402
I don&amp;#39;t believe -- look up in a thesaurus and find,2538.736,2.736
"some other ways, but I don&amp;#39;t know that there&amp;#39;s a",2541.472,2.669
distinction there that&amp;#39;s noteworthy.,2544.141,2.002
"But we&amp;#39;re not aware, I don&amp;#39;t believe,",2546.143,3.27
that that exists.,2549.413,0.868
The Press: What&amp;#39;s that based on?,2550.281,1.334
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s based on that I&amp;#39;ve,2551.615,1.468
not been aware of.,2553.083,1.001
But that&amp;#39;s the answer to that.,2554.084,2.269
When someone is asking me if I&amp;#39;m made aware of,2556.353,1.502
"something and the answer is no,",2557.855,1.134
then the answer is no.,2558.989,1.669
The Press: But the question was whether he,2560.658,0.667
was the target of a counterintelligence probe.,2561.325,1.735
"Mr. Spicer: Right, and the answer is,",2563.06,0.534
we&amp;#39;re not aware.,2563.594,1.201
I don&amp;#39;t know how much clearer we can be on this.,2564.795,2.102
The Press: So it&amp;#39;s just that White House is not,2566.897,1.935
aware if the President is the target of a,2568.832,2.436
counterintelligence probe?,2571.268,1.301
Mr. Spicer: Correct.,2572.569,1.936
I&amp;#39;m not sure what we&amp;#39;re dancing around,2574.505,1.902
the same question.,2576.407,0.767
"The Press: Well, because I think yesterday, when you",2577.174,3.67
"came out and corrected and clarified, people took",2580.844,1.469
"that as a definitive answer that, in fact, that",2582.313,2.902
was not the case that you said --,2585.215,0.935
"Mr. Spicer: No, it means we&amp;#39;re not aware.",2586.15,0.634
I don&amp;#39;t -- just that should be the,2586.784,1.635
definitive answer. Vivian.,2588.419,1.134
The Press: Thank you.,2589.553,0.968
"I have two questions, but a really quick",2590.521,1.201
follow-up to Zeke&amp;#39;s.,2591.722,1.368
Mr. Spicer: So that&amp;#39;s three.,2593.09,1.401
The Press: Two and a half.,2594.491,1.469
(Laughter.),2595.96,0.834
So can you elaborate a little bit on how and,2596.794,1.968
to what extent Michael Flynn was involved,2598.762,2.67
in shaping the current Turkey policy for,2601.432,2.602
President Trump?,2604.034,1.101
"I mean, was he engaging with the Turkish leaders and --",2605.135,2.57
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t have anything on that.,2607.705,2.636
You can contact the NSC on that.,2610.341,2.569
I&amp;#39;m not aware.,2612.91,1.301
The Press: Okay.,2614.211,0.501
So for my two real questions.,2614.712,1.534
"First, is there any official response to the",2616.246,2.737
lawsuit in Hawaii over the revised travel ban?,2618.983,3.003
Mr. Spicer: I think we feel very comfortable that,2621.986,2.335
the executive order that was crafted is consistent,2624.321,2.703
and we&amp;#39;re going to go forward on this.,2627.024,3.07
"But I think, by all means, I don&amp;#39;t want to -- we feel",2630.094,4.204
very confident with how that was crafted and the,2634.298,2.369
input that was given.,2636.667,1.735
The Press: Okay.,2638.402,0.567
"Thank you, and the second thing is Nigel Farage was",2638.969,3.103
at the Ecuadorian embassy in London today where,2642.072,3.137
Julian Assange happens to be staying.,2645.209,2.502
"We don&amp;#39;t know if they met or not, but was he there?",2647.711,2.67
"I mean, he&amp;#39;s a close ally of President Trump.",2650.381,2.535
Was he there in any official capacity?,2652.916,1.168
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t keep his schedule.,2654.084,1.135
The Press: Was he delivering a message?,2655.219,1.067
Do you know if there was contact on that?,2656.286,1.068
Mr. Spicer: I have no idea. No.,2657.354,0.968
"I have my own concerns here, keeping track of",2658.322,3.904
what everyone is doing.,2662.226,0.767
I generally don&amp;#39;t worry about what is going,2662.993,0.634
on across the pond. Johnathon.,2663.627,1.568
"The Press: You already gave me one, but just to",2665.195,2.97
follow through.,2668.165,0.601
(Laughter.),2668.766,1.401
The Press: I&amp;#39;ll take his.,2670.167,0.701
"Mr. Spicer: Wow, all right.",2670.868,0.433
"Hey, hey.",2671.301,1.635
"The Press: But the question is not what, but",2672.936,3.07
Farage -- can you tell us he just wasn&amp;#39;t there on,2676.006,2.202
behalf of the White House?,2678.208,1.035
Mr. Spicer: Sure.,2679.243,2.502
I don&amp;#39;t -- this is silly.,2681.745,2.636
I really don&amp;#39;t think asking where random,2684.381,1.769
foreign leaders are and whether or not they are,2686.15,2.769
there -- I&amp;#39;m sure he was there doing whatever on,2688.919,2.87
behalf of either the --,2691.789,0.867
The Press: -- ally leaders --,2692.656,1.702
Mr. Spicer: He&amp;#39;s a member of,2694.358,1.101
-- The Press: He had dinner with the President --,2695.459,1.602
Mr. Spicer: Okay.,2697.061,0.533
"I understand that, but I don&amp;#39;t keep his schedule.",2697.594,2.203
I&amp;#39;m not sure. Toulouse.,2699.797,0.834
The Press: Two questions on two different topics.,2700.631,3.703
"First, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin sent a",2704.334,3.604
letter to Congress saying that Congress should raise,2707.938,3.704
the debt ceiling.,2711.642,1.368
We know that the Office of Management and Budget,2713.01,1.802
"director, Mick Mulvaney, when he was in Congress,",2714.812,2.335
he voted against raising the debt ceiling,2717.147,2.77
multiple times.,2719.917,1.234
So is Mulvaney going to support the raising of the,2721.151,3.27
debt ceiling and does the President support that?,2724.421,1.902
And is he going to push Congress to do that?,2726.323,1.935
Mr. Spicer: I think we&amp;#39;ve got a few months,2728.258,0.935
to do that.,2729.193,0.934
I think the Secretary was making Congress,2730.127,2.269
very much aware.,2732.396,0.867
We got into -- have now been in the,2733.263,2.069
White House six weeks.,2735.332,2.402
We&amp;#39;re approaching the 50th day here of,2737.734,1.335
this administration.,2739.069,2.569
I think we are trying to deal with the,2741.638,1.469
situation at hand.,2743.107,1.501
Part of the reason that the President has,2744.608,1.368
addressed a budget the way he has is to try to get,2745.976,2.736
our nation&amp;#39;s debt deficit and budget in order.,2748.712,2.603
I think he&amp;#39;s continuing to show a tremendous respect,2751.315,2.569
"for taxpayer money, the way we spend money",2753.884,2.402
and bring it down.,2756.286,0.668
"But obviously, there are certain things that are a",2756.954,1.801
little beyond our control when we walked into this,2758.755,2.803
"building, and we&amp;#39;re going to work with Secretary",2761.558,2.403
Mnuchin and Director Mulvaney to address this,2763.961,1.935
"issue, and obviously work with Congress.",2765.896,1.568
The Press: Second question,2767.464,1.368
on another Cabinet Secretary.,2768.832,1.635
Scott Pruitt said today that carbon dioxide was,2770.467,3.103
not a primary contributor to global warming.,2773.57,3.604
That obviously is at odds with global,2777.174,1.368
scientific consensus.,2778.542,3.537
Does the President agree that --,2782.079,1.501
Mr. Spicer: I think --,2783.58,0.834
that&amp;#39;s a snippet of what Administrator,2784.414,2.002
Pruitt said.,2786.416,0.668
"He went on and said, I don&amp;#39;t think we know",2787.084,2.235
"conclusively, this is what know.",2789.319,1.402
I would suggest that you touch base with the,2790.721,2.235
EPA on that.,2792.956,1.402
"But that&amp;#39;s -- he has a very lengthy response, and",2794.358,2.736
so that is just one snippet of what the,2797.094,2.602
administrator said at that. Anita.,2799.696,1.335
The Press: Two things.,2801.031,1.702
"One, I think you mentioned at the top but I&amp;#39;m not",2802.733,1.701
"sure, that apprehensions were down",2804.434,2.203
across the border.,2806.637,3.336
There was a question yesterday about the wall.,2809.973,2.102
Is the wall still needed if the apprehensions,2812.075,2.136
are down?,2814.211,0.934
"Mr. Spicer: I think so, sure.",2815.145,1.468
The President was very clear.,2816.613,0.868
"It&amp;#39;s not just needed, the President committed to",2817.481,2.469
doing it to the American people.,2819.95,2.135
"And I think, while we can have a good month, and I",2822.085,2.103
"think we&amp;#39;ll see if that continues, that the",2824.188,2.569
President made a commitment to the American,2826.757,2.202
people to make sure that this isn&amp;#39;t just an,2828.959,3.637
"anomaly, and that, while they might be down, I",2832.596,2.836
think we have to do what we can to protect our,2835.432,2.703
"country, both in terms of national security and",2838.135,2.269
economic security.,2840.404,2.636
"So it&amp;#39;s of course still needed, and it&amp;#39;s a",2843.04,2.035
"commitment that the President made, and I",2845.075,2.102
"think one of the things that the American people,",2847.177,1.068
"regardless of where they stand across the aisle,",2849.313,2.202
appreciate about this President is that he is a,2851.515,1.468
man that has kept his word.,2852.983,2.002
"He talks -- he made commitments to them, and",2854.985,2.736
he&amp;#39;s fulfilling them to make the country better. Goyal.,2857.721,2.402
"The Press: Sean, I said there was a second question.",2860.123,1.769
"Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sorry, you did.",2861.892,1.268
The Press: I think you&amp;#39;ve been asked this before but,2863.16,3.904
have been reluctant to say whether President Obama,2867.064,2.135
and President Trump have spoken since the,2869.199,2.469
"inauguration, although President Trump was very",2871.668,3.304
forthcoming about that during the transition so,2874.972,3.169
I&amp;#39;m not sure why you wouldn&amp;#39;t mention it.,2878.141,1.569
But I&amp;#39;m just asking that again.,2879.71,1.468
And there was a report yesterday that said aides,2881.178,3.837
for both Presidents have spoken.,2885.015,2.536
Can you talk to us about either of those things?,2887.551,0.901
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;d be glad to follow up.,2888.452,1.768
Unfortunately I did not ask the President whether,2890.22,2.87
or not he spoke -- I&amp;#39;ll be back tomorrow -- The,2893.09,2.502
Press: Can you follow up?,2895.592,2.369
Can you ask about the aides?,2897.961,0.968
"Mr. Spicer: Yes, I can. I will.",2898.929,1.368
I keep my word too. Goyal.,2900.297,1.601
"The Press: Okay, well -- Mr. Spicer: Stealing what",2901.898,4.338
-- all the way --,2906.236,0.667
The Press: It&amp;#39;s actually me.,2906.903,1.535
(Laughter.),2908.438,1.202
The Press: Lost your shot.,2909.64,2.402
Mr. Spicer: Look at that.,2912.042,1.401
The Press: Can you tell about policy now on,2913.443,1.402
"Guantanamo, how it might have changed, where",2914.845,2.002
things are with that?,2916.847,1.368
"Mr. Spicer: Where what, please?",2918.215,0.901
"The Press: On Guantanamo, on whether Guantanamo will",2919.116,2.869
"be expanded, whether detainees will be brought",2921.985,2.836
"to Guantanamo, whether",2924.821,0.968
they will be transferred out.,2925.789,1.168
Just where things are.,2926.957,1.268
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t have anything to announce with,2928.225,2.502
respect to its expansion or its use --,2930.727,2.069
expansion use.,2932.796,1.235
I think the President has commented on the,2934.031,3.903
importance of Guantanamo and the need to maintain,2937.934,3.137
that the people who are there are not people who,2941.071,2.269
seek to do anyone good.,2943.34,2.035
"They&amp;#39;re there for a reason, and he has no",2945.375,2.236
"plans to close it, if that&amp;#39;s what you&amp;#39;re asking.",2947.611,3.07
As far as the future use goes in terms of,2950.681,1.768
"expansion, I don&amp;#39;t have anything to comment",2952.449,2.102
on at this time.,2954.551,0.667
"All the way in the back, yeah.",2955.218,2.503
"You got it, Goyal.",2957.721,0.3
"The Press: All right, all right --",2958.021,0.467
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, Goyal.",2958.488,0.935
(Laughter.),2959.423,1.134
You keep trying to,2960.557,1.735
steal his question.,2962.292,0.734
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",2963.026,0.567
Two questions please.,2963.593,1.335
One is that -- as far as the attacks on the Indian,2964.928,3.036
"American communities across the nation, they&amp;#39;re",2967.964,3.671
"not new, it happened in the past also.",2971.635,1.868
But the Indian American communities recently have,2973.503,3.47
"been having candle vigils, have prayers, and all",2976.973,2.937
kinds of those things.,2979.91,0.801
"And also, the Indian ambassador met with the",2980.711,4.938
State Department officials -- President Trump recently.,2985.649,3.203
So any presidential message for the Indian,2988.852,3.77
"American community, how to",2992.622,1.802
stop these attacks at this time?,2994.424,4.038
Mr. Spicer: I think with respect to -- are you,2998.462,1.334
talking about the event in Kansas City specifically?,2999.796,2.636
"The Press: Yeah, and another one also.",3002.432,1.502
Mr. Spicer: I think the President -- whether it&amp;#39;s,3003.934,2.869
"the event that happened in Kansas City, other events,",3006.803,3.37
the attacks on Jewish community centers that,3010.173,1.569
continue to plague us -- we saw another report this,3011.742,1.701
morning of some unfortunate activity.,3013.443,2.202
"I think we&amp;#39;ve got to continue to call it out,",3015.645,2.603
"we&amp;#39;ve got to continue to root it out, we&amp;#39;ve got to",3018.248,2.603
"continue to engage law enforcement, whatever is",3020.851,2.102
the applicable level of law enforcement,3022.953,3.136
depending on the event.,3026.089,1.335
But it&amp;#39;s something that I think all Americans should,3027.424,3.87
be outraged and disgusted by -- and stand up for the,3031.294,3.471
"principles that unite us, and that&amp;#39;s what the",3034.765,1.701
President spoke so eloquently about during,3036.466,4.405
"his joint address, and made it very clear that",3040.871,1.735
"while certain policies may divide us as individuals,",3042.606,2.836
there are certain principles that,3045.442,1.435
can unite us.,3046.877,0.667
John Frederick.,3047.544,0.968
"The Press: And second part of my question, please,",3048.512,1.001
I&amp;#39;m sorry.,3049.513,1.234
"As far as the U.S.-India relations are concerned,",3050.747,2.503
they have been great in the past and now we have,3053.25,1.835
two businessmen in India -- Prime Minister Modi is,3055.085,3.97
"also a businessman, and he -- President Trump of",3059.055,2.002
"course a great, successful businessman.",3061.057,2.403
"So recently, high official visits have been going on",3063.46,4.171
"from India to the U.S., meeting President Trump",3067.631,2.669
"and officials, including foreign secretary and",3070.3,4.171
Commerce secretary and -- from the energy,3074.471,1.735
department from India.,3076.206,2.903
So where do we go -- what is the future under,3079.109,2.336
President Trump&amp;#39;s administration of,3081.445,2.802
"U.S.-India relations economically, trade, and",3084.247,2.369
bilateral -- all of those.,3086.616,1.502
Mr. Spicer: Thank you.,3088.118,1.468
I think he has talked about during the campaign,3089.586,3.737
and the transition establishing a deeper,3093.323,2.536
relationship with Prime Minister Modi and U.S.,3095.859,2.736
-- India and businesses.,3098.595,0.934
And I think as we move forward in terms of our,3099.529,2.002
"foreign policy, we&amp;#39;ll have further updates on that.",3101.531,3.337
"But as you know very well, he spoke very clearly and",3104.868,5.105
frequently about the relationship that we have,3109.973,3.504
and hope to continue to grow with India.,3113.477,1.868
John Frederick.,3115.345,1.068
"The Press: Sean, thank you.",3116.413,1.935
During the campaign President Trump was not,3118.348,2.302
shy about his desire to get the United States out,3120.65,3.07
"of these Middle Eastern wars, yet as a question",3123.72,3.07
"earlier, we just sent 250 Marines into Syria.",3126.79,5.305
Is President Trump committed to going to,3132.095,2.269
Congress to receiving authorization for an AUMF,3134.364,6.907
or a declaration of war if we continue to deploy,3141.271,4.671
United States troops overseas?,3145.942,2.536
"Mr. Spicer: Well, John, I think there&amp;#39;s a big",3148.478,1.168
difference between an authorization of war than,3150.146,2.069
sending a few hundred advisors.,3152.215,2.369
And I think most in Congress would probably,3154.584,2.102
agree with that as well.,3157.053,0.601
I think that&amp;#39;s a big difference between a,3158.288,1.368
hostile action and going in to address some certain,3159.656,1.668
"concerns, whether it&amp;#39;s certain countries in the",3162.926,2.269
Middle East or elsewhere.,3165.195,1.335
I would refer you to the Department of Defense,3166.53,2.535
on that one.,3169.065,0.701
I think the actions that he has done and taken with,3169.766,4.538
"the advice that his generals have given him,",3174.304,2.269
"his admirals as well, is something that we will",3176.573,4.571
continue to work on.,3181.144,1.502
The Press: Two questions.,3182.646,2.903
"One, first off, kind of clarifying the difference",3185.549,2.202
between the campaign stop and also the,3187.751,2.102
healthcare rollout.,3189.853,1.234
So Nashville will be kind of the campaign stop.,3191.087,1.769
How will the White House kind of pick and choose,3192.856,2.469
"how that goes, whether it&amp;#39;s going to be a",3195.325,1.668
presidential visit trying to sell the healthcare,3196.993,1.802
"rollout, or one for the campaign?",3198.795,1.902
And then a second question.,3200.697,1.435
Mr. Spicer: I think the campaign will make,3202.132,2.936
decisions with respect to how they want to spend,3205.068,2.336
their money and where they want to go.,3207.404,1.368
And the White House will do the same.,3208.772,5.005
But that&amp;#39;s something that every President back as,3213.777,1.701
far as modern history has done as well.,3215.478,1.735
The President will be visiting several cities,3217.213,5.005
over the next coming weeks to engage the American,3225.755,2.903
people on the need to repeal and replace and,3228.658,3.47
other steps that he&amp;#39;s taking to deliver on the,3232.128,2.036
promises that he&amp;#39;s made as Commander-in-Chief.,3234.164,1.535
"The Press: And then a second question, I know",3235.699,1.334
Senator Cruz was here for dinner last night.,3237.033,2.002
Can you characterize the relationship,3239.035,1.468
between the two men?,3240.503,1.235
2018 will be here before you know it.,3241.738,1.768
Do you anticipate the President will be there,3243.506,1.435
to support him in that effort?,3244.941,3.037
Mr. Spicer: We got a few battles to get through,3247.978,2.602
"legislatively, but I know that he enjoyed welcoming",3250.58,4.004
Senator and Mrs. Cruz and their two daughters last,3254.584,1.769
night to the White House.,3256.353,0.834
They had a very enjoyable time and a very,3257.187,2.202
fruitful discussion.,3259.389,1.802
But it&amp;#39;s something that he&amp;#39;s going to continue to,3261.191,2.135
"do with members of both parties, both chambers,",3263.326,4.104
and not just here in Washington.,3267.43,1.468
I think you&amp;#39;re going to see him continue to engage,3268.898,1.969
with governors and attorneys general and,3270.867,2.035
lieutenant governors.,3272.902,1.435
The President truly enjoys this level of engagement.,3274.337,3.404
"He likes to sit down and talk about ideas, talk",3277.741,2.969
about the future of this country and get their,3280.71,2.102
input and ideas.,3282.812,0.701
And I think they talked a little business and a lot,3283.513,2.402
"of personal last night, and it was a very",3285.915,2.303
enjoyable thing.,3288.218,0.667
"With that, thank you, guys.",3288.885,1.301
Have a great day.,3290.186,1.235
I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.,3291.421,1.435
I think tomorrow is going to be one-question Friday.,3292.856,2.169
Thank you all.,3295.025,1.234
