"Mr. Spicer: Welcome back, everyone.",0.567,1.468
Good to see you all after a few days -- for those of,2.035,2.402
you who didn&amp;#39;t get a chance to go down to Florida.,4.437,1.602
"This morning, in the Rose Garden, the President was",6.039,2.336
honored to host the swearing-in of Associate,8.375,3.803
Justice Neil Gorsuch.,12.178,2.236
His confirmation was the culmination of a,14.414,1.835
thoughtful and deliberative process that,16.249,2.369
the President started almost a year ago when he,18.618,3.103
released his initial list of potential nominees for,21.721,3.17
the Supreme Court.,24.891,1.468
"In September, he released a final, definitive list,",26.359,3.07
promising to select only from those individuals who,29.429,3.136
would continue the legacy of the great Justice,32.565,2.203
Scalia on the bench.,34.768,1.601
"And today, the President celebrated our new",36.369,2.236
associate justice who will protect our Constitution,38.605,3.103
for generations.,41.708,1.635
"It was definitely a great day to kick off the week,",43.343,3.036
and another productive week that we will see,46.379,2.136
here at the White House.,48.515,1.301
"Before I get into the upcoming week, just a",49.816,2.803
couple updates from over the weekend.,52.619,2.102
"First, the President spoke with Prime Minister Lofven",54.721,2.903
of Sweden to express our condolences for the loved,57.624,3.069
ones who were killed in Friday&amp;#39;s terrorist attack,60.693,2.503
"in central Stockholm, Sweden, and to wish a",63.196,2.569
speedy recovery for those who were wounded.,65.765,2.569
The President also called President Sisi yesterday,68.334,2.87
to convey his deepest condolences to Egypt and,71.204,2.736
the families who lost loved ones in the heinous,73.94,2.336
attack that occurred there.,76.276,1.535
Dozens of innocent people were killed and many more,77.811,2.235
were injured on holy Palm Sunday.,80.046,2.269
The United States condemns in the strongest terms,82.315,3.77
these barbaric attacks on Christian places of,86.085,2.77
worship in Tanta and in Alexandria.,88.855,3.036
The President also spoke with the King of Saudi,91.891,2.603
"Arabia, the Prime Minister of Japan, the Acting",94.494,2.936
"President of South Korea, all about the United",97.43,2.569
States&amp;#39; military strike on the airfield in Syria.,99.999,4.171
All of the leaders expressed support for the,104.17,1.869
United States&amp;#39; necessary action in response to the,106.039,3.87
horrible chemical and bomb attack on,109.909,3.003
innocent civilians.,112.912,1.535
"And yesterday, he spoke with Commander Andria",114.447,2.736
"Slough, the commanding officer of the USS Porter,",117.183,4.204
"and Commander Russell Caldwell, the commanding",121.387,2.336
"officer of the USS Ross, to thank them and their",123.723,2.87
teams for successfully carrying out that strike.,126.593,3.47
"During these calls, the President communicated",130.063,1.902
that he could not be more proud of the crews of,131.965,2.235
these two ships and their flawless execution,134.2,3.07
of these operations.,137.27,1.535
"As you know, these ships, between the two of them,",138.805,4.004
sent 59 Tomahawk missiles and each of them hit all,142.809,3.27
"of their targets, showing America&amp;#39;s power and the",146.079,2.702
"military&amp;#39;s accuracy, which is just a small",148.781,3.604
representation of our military&amp;#39;s overall,152.385,2.569
capability and a fraction of what this President,154.954,3.003
will continue to build up the military to be,157.957,2.303
throughout his administration.,160.26,1.968
The sight of people being gassed and blown away by,162.228,3.504
barrel bombs ensures that if we see this kind of,165.732,3.403
"action again, we hold open the possibility",169.135,2.97
of future action.,172.105,0.834
The resulting action of what happened ensured that,172.939,5.005
their fueling operation is gone from this air,180.513,2.002
"facility, 20 percent of their fixed-wing aircraft",182.515,3.27
"were destroyed and knocked out, and I think by all",185.785,2.503
"measures, the world and domestic reaction was",188.288,3.536
highly laudable for the President&amp;#39;s action.,191.824,4.739
"Additionally, obviously, we&amp;#39;re all aware that the",196.563,1.735
President had a very successful visit with the,198.298,2.402
"Chinese President, and it concluded on Friday.",200.7,3.27
"As you&amp;#39;ve read, one of the most significant",203.97,1.435
developments from these discussions was the,205.405,1.601
agreement to create a 100-day initial plan --,207.006,3.971
hopefully with some tangible near-term,210.977,1.368
deliverables -- to lead to a more balanced economic,212.345,2.736
relationship between our two countries.,215.081,3.003
"As that develops, we&amp;#39;ll make sure that we provide",218.084,2.669
you with additional details.,220.753,1.702
"And this morning, the President was glad to see",222.455,1.535
Toyota announce that it will be spending $1.33,223.99,2.803
billion in its Kentucky plant as part of its plan,226.793,3.47
to invest $10 billion in America over the next five,230.263,3.07
"years, a continued signal of the confidence that",233.333,3.536
businesses have in the American economy under,236.869,2.436
President Trump.,239.305,1.302
"Now, in terms of the week ahead.",240.607,1.735
"Tomorrow, the President will have a discussion on",242.342,1.668
strategy and policy with several members of his,244.01,2.336
Cabinet and a group of CEOs.,246.346,2.135
This is a follow-up from his meeting with 20 CEOs,248.481,2.736
from the Strategic and Policy Forum just this,251.217,2.97
"past February, with some of the same business",254.187,1.802
leaders and some new ones.,255.989,1.868
"First, they&amp;#39;ll meet in small interactive groups,",257.857,2.469
"each led by a Cabinet member, to discuss the",260.326,2.603
priorities for those Cabinet Secretaries and,262.929,2.335
their agencies.,265.264,1.135
The President will then oversee a report that will,266.399,2.736
"be presented to the group -- by the group, rather.",269.135,2.87
The Cabinet-level participants will be,272.005,1.434
"Secretary of Commerce Ross, Secretary of",273.439,1.869
"Education DeVos, EPA Administrator Pruitt, OMB",275.308,5.672
"Director Mulvaney, and Secretary of",280.98,2.569
Transportation Elaine Chao.,283.549,1.235
We&amp;#39;ll have the full list of additional participants,285.318,2.402
for you later.,287.72,1.535
As part of the effort to deescalate the conflict in,289.255,2.536
Syria and press for a political process that can,291.791,2.903
resolve the conflict and eventually result in a,294.694,2.369
"transition of a new, legitimate Syrian",297.063,2.369
"leadership, U.S.* [U.N.] Special Envoy for Syria",299.432,3.17
will be coming to Washington tomorrow for,302.602,1.401
consultations with the State Department and with,304.003,2.403
National Security Advisor McMaster here at the White,306.406,2.702
"House, among others.",309.108,1.735
He has been overseeing the political talks among,310.843,2.57
Syrian parties in Geneva.,313.413,1.868
"On Wednesday, we will welcome the Secretary",315.281,2.536
"General of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, to the White House.",317.817,3.036
The President and Secretary General will,320.853,1.836
have a joint press conference later,322.689,1.368
in the afternoon.,324.057,1.167
And then the President plans to spend the Easter,325.224,2.102
"holiday in Florida, and he&amp;#39;ll return to the",327.326,1.702
White House on Sunday.,329.028,2.269
"As the President noted today, as we hit day 81 in",331.297,4.037
"the President&amp;#39;s administration, we have",335.334,3.904
"done so many great things, including nominate and",339.238,5.139
confirm a Supreme Court justice; roll back more,344.377,3.17
regulations than any President in modern times;,347.547,2.636
"roll back the Obama-era war on coal, oil and",350.183,2.402
natural gas; restore confidence in the economy.,352.585,3.237
"We&amp;#39;re now seeing historic levels of consumer, CEO,",355.822,2.569
"homebuilder, manufacture confidence.",358.391,2.769
There&amp;#39;s been a 12 percent gain in the stock market.,361.16,2.77
We&amp;#39;ve even seen a real resurgence in,363.93,2.502
the mining industry.,366.432,1.302
We&amp;#39;ve reduced illegal boarding* [border],367.734,1.368
crossings by over 60 percent to the lowest,369.102,2.202
"level in nearly two decades, and implemented",371.304,2.436
"historic ethics reforms, including a five-year",373.74,2.135
lobbying ban and a lifetime foreign ban.,375.875,3.27
"So with that, I&amp;#39;d be glad to take your questions.",379.145,2.235
The Press: Why is it okay to bomb Syria but not okay,381.38,4.505
to assist the refugees?,385.885,1.134
One.,387.019,1.102
"And number two, what is the reaction -- this",388.121,0.867
administration&amp;#39;s reaction to Russia saying we are,388.988,3.403
running a danger of a real war within the Middle East?,392.391,3.738
"Mr. Spicer: Well, with respect to number one, the",396.129,3.069
reason that we took action was multifold -- number,399.198,2.703
"one, to stop the proliferation and",401.901,1.668
deterrence of chemical weapons.,403.569,1.735
When you see mass weapons of destruction being used,405.304,4.238
"it should be a concern to every nation,",409.542,1.902
especially our own people.,411.444,1.101
The proliferation of those weapons pose a grave,412.545,7.107
threat to our national security.,419.652,1.869
"So, number one, we have to stop that.",421.521,1.835
"Number two, we have to stop ISIS.",423.356,1.935
"But with respect to the people of Syria, by us",425.291,3.937
taking action and deescalating what&amp;#39;s going,429.228,3.637
"on in Syria, that&amp;#39;s the greatest thing you can do",432.865,2.836
to support those people.,435.701,1.702
"Deescalating the conflict there, containing ISIS is",437.403,3.27
the greatest aspect of humanitarian relief that,440.673,2.669
"we can provide, first and foremost.",443.342,1.769
"Secondly, creating areas in which we can work with",445.111,4.504
"allies, including Russia, in committing to ensuring",449.615,2.937
that there are places that are free from violence and,452.552,3.27
are places free for people to gather safely is another.,455.822,3.57
Because I think everyone would agree that the last,459.392,3.103
thing people want to do there is leave.,462.495,1.535
They want to stay there.,464.03,0.834
They want to be in Syria.,464.864,1.368
They want to have a safe place to remain with their,466.232,3.103
families and not be separated.,469.335,1.602
"So our number-one priority is to defeat ISIS, but",470.937,2.702
"we&amp;#39;re also, I think from a humanitarian standpoint",473.639,2.736
"and a refugee standpoint, ensuring that we create an",476.375,2.703
environment that provides a safe place for them,479.078,4.471
to ultimately remain.,483.549,2.536
"And then on Russia, in particular, look, I think",486.085,2.069
that if you look at the countries that are with,488.154,3.57
"us, it speaks pretty loudly the number of",491.724,3.036
countries that have stood shoulder-to-shoulder,494.76,2.169
with this President.,496.929,1.302
"Russia, on the other hand, stands with Syria,",498.231,2.636
North Korea and Iran.,500.867,2.035
I think when you contrast the two groups of country,502.902,3.27
"sets, it&amp;#39;s pretty clear that we&amp;#39;re on the right",506.172,3.036
side of this issue.,509.208,0.968
The Press: Right.,510.176,1.334
So does that mean we&amp;#39;re going to commit troops?,511.51,0.935
"I mean, there&amp;#39;s talking about a war.",512.445,1.101
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, what it means is that I think",513.546,2.336
the action that we took last week has been widely,515.882,3.803
"praised, domestically and internationally, as a",519.685,3.27
great step to ensure the deterrence and,522.955,1.802
proliferation of chemical weapons and of action,524.757,2.569
against innocent people.,527.326,1.669
When you watch babies and children being gassed and,528.995,3.87
"suffer under barrel bombs, you are instantaneously",532.865,6.34
moved to action.,539.205,0.967
I think this President has made it very clear that if,540.172,3.704
"those actions were to continue, further action",543.876,1.802
will definitely be considered by the United States.,545.678,1.568
We continue to urge further the world,547.246,4.738
"community to join us in this, in both stopping --",551.984,3.103
the deterrence -- and proliferation of use of,555.087,2.269
"those weapons, but then further, trying to create",557.356,2.903
a political environment that will result,560.259,1.835
in new leadership.,562.094,1.001
Those are very important.,563.095,2.903
They go hand in hand.,565.998,0.801
The Press: Are we building a coalition or --,566.799,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: I think we have a -- I mean, again, I",568.134,2.302
"think if you look at who&amp;#39;s not with us, it&amp;#39;s a pretty",570.436,2.803
small group and not a group that too many people,573.239,3.103
are looking to bring on board.,576.342,1.001
"I mean, you got Iran, Syria, North Korea, and",577.343,3.537
Russia on one side of this.,580.88,1.368
That&amp;#39;s a pretty small group.,582.248,3.336
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",585.584,0.835
President Trump has spoken out extensively about the,586.419,1.701
crimes of Bashar al-Assad in Syria.,588.12,1.702
Does the President consider Assad a war criminal?,589.822,3.27
And does he believe Assad should eventually,593.092,1.635
appear before the ICC?,594.727,1.201
Mr. Spicer: I think right now the focus is twofold.,595.928,2.903
"One is defeating ISIS, and the second is creating the",598.831,2.436
political environment necessary for the Syrian,601.267,3.003
people to have new leadership there.,604.27,2.202
I don&amp;#39;t think that there&amp;#39;s -- I can&amp;#39;t imagine a,606.472,4.738
stable and peaceful Syria where Bashar,611.21,2.736
al-Assad is in power.,613.946,1.969
I think we all recognize that that happens -- and,615.915,2.602
there can be a multipronged approach; we,618.517,3.471
are ensuring that ISIS is contained and that there&amp;#39;s,621.988,2.502
a de-escalation of the proliferation of chemical,624.49,2.736
"weapons, at the same time, creating the environment",627.226,3.871
for a change of leadership.,631.097,2.402
The Press: Does the President believe Assad,633.499,1.602
has committed a war crime?,635.101,1.268
Mr. Spicer: I think that there is a court that,636.369,2.669
decides those things.,639.038,0.667
"And obviously, there&amp;#39;s a reason that -- well, I",639.705,2.736
clearly -- the actions -- when you take an action,642.441,2.503
"against the people that he has, and I think we feel",644.944,3.003
unbelievably confident in the intelligence that we have.,647.947,4.171
"But again, that would be something for a court to decide.",652.118,2.903
Charlie.,655.021,1.267
The Press: A lot of people are talking about what the,656.288,2.403
"Trump doctrine is on foreign policy, what it",658.691,2.302
"may or may not include, and the President even",660.993,2.703
stated that he was very flexible.,663.696,1.401
Do you know what the Trump doctrine is on foreign,665.097,3.07
"policy, and can you explain it to us?",668.167,2.669
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, I think the Trump doctrine is",670.836,3.037
something that he articulated throughout the,673.873,1.334
"campaign, which is that&amp;#39;s America is first.",675.207,1.535
We&amp;#39;re going to make sure that our national,676.742,1.335
interests are protected; that we do what we can to,678.077,4.037
"make sure that our interests, both",682.114,1.535
"economically and national security, are at the",683.649,2.102
forefront; and we&amp;#39;re not just going to become the,685.751,1.335
"world&amp;#39;s policeman running around the world, but that",687.086,3.17
we have to find a clear and defined national,690.256,1.701
interest wherever we act and that it&amp;#39;s our national,691.957,4.071
"security, first and foremost, that has to",696.028,2.703
deal with how we act.,698.731,1.468
The Press: The action in Syria fits,700.199,0.934
in that doctrine?,701.133,0.834
Mr. Spicer: Absolutely.,701.967,0.501
I think if you recognize the threat that our,702.468,4.371
country and our people face if there is a growth,706.839,2.936
of use or spread of chemical weapons of mass,709.775,3.103
"destruction, those -- the proliferation of those,",712.878,3.938
the spread to other groups is a clear danger to our,716.816,3.87
country and to our people Kristin.,720.686,1.902
"The Press: Sean, thank you.",722.588,0.601
I was just going to follow up on what you were saying,723.189,1.468
about Bashar al-Assad.,724.657,1.001
Are you saying that defeating ISIS and getting,725.658,3.003
Bashar al-Assad out of power through a political,728.661,2.969
process should happen at the same time?,731.63,2.636
Mr. Spicer: I think -- I&amp;#39;m not trying to -- how you,734.266,2.303
"sequence them, but I don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re",736.569,1.334
mutually exclusive.,737.903,1.035
I don&amp;#39;t think that you have to do one and another.,738.938,3.27
But I think they kind of go hand in hand.,742.208,1.902
"As you reduce ISIS&amp;#39;s strength, as you",744.11,2.669
"deescalate the conflict in Syria, the political",746.779,4.004
environment to remove him becomes,750.783,1.735
stronger and stronger.,752.518,1.134
"The Press: And just to be clear, Secretary",753.652,1.702
"Tillerson, over the weekend, said we can",755.354,2.202
navigate a political outcome in which the,757.556,2.336
Syrian people will determine Bashar,759.892,1.235
al-Assad&amp;#39;s fate and his legitimacy.,761.127,1.935
Nikki Haley seemed to align more with,763.062,1.501
what you were saying.,764.563,1.001
"She said, no way do we see peace in that area with",765.564,2.369
Assad as the head of the Syrian government.,767.933,2.303
So who better reflects the --,770.236,1.268
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s --,771.504,0.634
I don&amp;#39;t think those are mutually exclusive statements.,772.138,3.536
The Press: How so?,775.674,0.868
Mr. Spicer: Because I don&amp;#39;t think -- I think,776.542,1.335
"that you can -- one of them is saying, we don&amp;#39;t",777.877,2.969
see peace with him in charge.,780.846,2.002
"The other one is saying, we need to have him gone.",782.848,3.27
I think that&amp;#39;s the point of both.,786.118,1.468
The goal for both of them -- the goal for the United,787.586,2.703
"States is twofold, as I&amp;#39;ve stated.",790.289,2.402
"It&amp;#39;s, one, to make sure that we destabilize Syria",792.691,3.337
"-- destabilize the conflict there, reduce",796.028,3.804
the threat of ISIS.,799.832,1.368
"But then, secondly, is create the political",801.2,2.069
"environment not just within the Syrian people,",803.269,3.303
"but I think you can have -- work with Russia, in",806.572,3.303
"particular, to make sure that they understand that",809.875,1.802
"Syria, backed up by Russia&amp;#39;s own accounting,",811.677,3.604
should be held accountable for the agreements that,815.281,2.602
it&amp;#39;s made with respect to its international,817.883,1.435
agreements on chemical weapons alone.,819.318,2.436
The Press: And can you defeat ISIS with Assad,821.754,1.568
still in power?,823.322,3.871
Mr. Spicer: Yes.,827.193,1.401
Sure.,828.594,1.068
But I think that -- I think you can defeat ISIS,829.662,3.537
with him in power.,833.199,0.934
"I think that obviously, to your point, it&amp;#39;s not like",834.133,2.436
there&amp;#39;s a single track that says you have to do it.,836.569,1.935
"I mean, if we can get both at the same time, or one",838.504,2.369
"happens after another, that&amp;#39;s fine as well.",840.873,1.501
But I think that we obviously -- the,842.374,2.57
number-one threat that America faces is ISIS in,844.944,2.969
"that region, and we&amp;#39;ve got to make sure that we do",847.913,1.802
everything we can to do that.,849.715,2.402
"The Press: And just finally, when Secretary",852.117,1.135
"Tillerson meets with his Russian counterpart, what",853.252,2.536
is his specific message going to be?,855.788,2.068
"Is he going to threaten, potentially, more",857.856,2.136
sanctions if Russia doesn&amp;#39;t get --,859.992,1.668
"Mr. Spicer: Look, I think he is on his way there",861.66,2.102
"tomorrow, and I&amp;#39;ll let Secretary Tillerson talk",863.762,2.036
about his meeting with Foreign Minister Lavrov.,865.798,2.269
I think there&amp;#39;s a lot of things to obviously,868.067,3.436
discuss -- the overall fight on ISIS.,871.503,2.737
"But I think with respect to Syria, in particular, I",874.24,2.469
think we need to remind them of the commitments,876.709,3.136
"that they&amp;#39;ve made, and the commitments that Syria has made.",879.845,2.669
And I think that --,882.514,0.768
The Press: (Inaudible.),883.282,1.168
"Mr. Spicer: I think that, first and foremost, we",884.45,1.601
need to make sure that we all understand what the,886.051,2.736
situation is on the ground.,888.787,1.769
There is no question who acted in this case and,890.556,2.602
what Syria did.,893.158,1.335
And I think that we need to make sure that Russia,894.493,2.936
"fully understands the actions that Assad took,",897.429,4.738
"the commitments that Syria has made, and Russia has",902.167,3.604
equally agreed to the same understanding.,905.771,2.936
"So that getting them back on the same page, first",908.707,1.969
"and foremost, would seem the logical step.",910.676,2.669
"But secondly, and I guess equally as important, is",913.345,2.503
to make sure that the areas where we can find a,915.848,1.601
commitment to defeat ISIS is something that we share.,917.449,2.469
Major.,919.918,1.001
The Press: So would the President want the,920.919,1.635
Secretary of State to put the threat of sanctions on,922.554,2.436
the table to get Russia&amp;#39;s attention in this matter?,924.99,3.07
Because the Secretary of State said Russia is,928.06,1.568
either complicit or incompetent.,929.628,3.037
What does the President believe Russia,932.665,1.601
actually is in this --,934.266,1.435
"Mr. Spicer: Well, look, we&amp;#39;ll",935.701,0.867
have plenty of time to discuss how those talks go.,936.568,2.636
I don&amp;#39;t want to -- the one thing the President has,939.204,1.769
been very clear on from the get-go is that he,940.973,2.336
doesn&amp;#39;t like to telegraph all the cards that he has.,943.309,3.236
I think he wants to see how that conversation goes,946.545,2.669
with Secretary Tillerson.,949.214,1.001
If we can get them to agree to commit to action,950.215,3.871
"on defeating ISIS, get --",954.086,1.768
The Press: What kind of action?,955.854,0.434
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re",956.288,0.934
going to have a discussion about.,957.222,1.402
I think that we need to see what goes beyond,958.624,1.768
"rhetoric and what goes -- where that talk start, and",960.392,3.304
what they&amp;#39;re willing to commit to in action.,963.696,1.835
I think that&amp;#39;s important.,965.531,0.934
"I think to get ahead of this right now, before",966.465,2.769
"they meet, is not something I want to do.",969.234,2.47
I&amp;#39;d like to let Secretary Tillerson meet with,971.704,2.002
"Lavrov, have that conversation, and",973.706,2.302
then report back.,976.008,0.734
"The Press: Two more, quickly, about the",976.742,2.135
White House itself.,978.877,0.601
What is the President&amp;#39;s perspective on the ability,979.478,3.303
-- the current ability of his senior advisors to,982.781,2.57
"resolve their ideological differences, resolve their",985.351,3.103
"personality differences, and work as a team?",988.454,3.67
Mr. Spicer: He&amp;#39;s very confident in that.,992.124,1.568
The Press: Why?,993.692,0.868
"Mr. Spicer: Because this is the same group, with",994.56,2.235
"the same ideologies, the same strengths, that came",996.795,3.537
together for a common purpose to win a campaign.,1000.332,2.97
There is an unbelievably talented team at the,1003.302,2.602
"senior level, and at the mid-level, and, frankly,",1005.904,1.669
all the way down to the bottom level of this,1007.573,1.768
administration that is committed to the,1009.341,2.302
President&amp;#39;s agenda.,1011.643,0.935
"I said this multiple times throughout the transition,",1012.578,2.702
"that everybody that came into this administration,",1015.28,3.204
while they might have a personal view or an action,1018.484,2.135
"on an issue, they understand -- understood",1020.619,2.936
and understand the President&amp;#39;s,1023.555,1.669
vision and agenda.,1025.224,1.434
And their goal of coming into this was to,1026.658,3.17
"understand, first and foremost, that it is the",1029.828,1.869
President who made pledges and promises to the,1031.697,2.235
American people about the direction he&amp;#39;d take this,1033.932,1.602
country and the actions he has taken.,1035.534,2.703
And he is doing that.,1038.237,1.034
And I just read off a series of them in terms of,1039.271,1.835
"the judges that he&amp;#39;s appointed, the",1041.106,1.468
Congressional Review Act pieces of legislation that,1042.574,2.57
"the signed, the executive orders.",1045.144,1.568
When you look at the actions that he&amp;#39;s taken,1046.712,2.602
and the results that he&amp;#39;s getting -- 60 percent,1049.314,2.87
down on the border.,1052.184,0.968
Nobody would dispute the fact that immigration was,1053.152,2.802
"a hot topic during this campaign, and the",1055.954,3.103
President&amp;#39;s actions are seeing results.,1059.057,2.436
And I think you&amp;#39;re seeing it both on the market,1061.493,2.336
and on a national security front.,1063.829,1.335
"So he understands that we have some pretty smart,",1065.164,3.903
talented individuals who are opinionated on a lot,1069.067,2.403
"of subjects, but that our battles and our policy",1071.47,3.303
differences need to be behind closed doors; we,1074.773,3.17
"need to focus, and ultimately all come out",1077.943,2.102
committed to advancing the President&amp;#39;s agenda.,1080.045,1.468
"But he is completely aware of the talent that he has,",1081.513,4.104
and that&amp;#39;s part of the reason that he&amp;#39;s brought,1085.617,1.969
"this team together, is because of the talent and",1087.586,2.769
successes and accomplishments they&amp;#39;ve,1090.355,1.569
had on a variety of backgrounds.,1091.924,2.102
And he fully believes that they are going to continue,1094.026,3.837
to push forward to advance his agenda.,1097.863,1.868
The Press: -- led him to have or order this meeting,1099.731,2.87
"on Friday where the two principals, Bannon and",1102.601,2.302
"Jared Kushner, were essentially told by the",1104.903,1.702
"President, cool this and get along and get",1106.605,3.003
on the same page?,1109.608,1.235
"Mr. Spicer: Well, look, I think there&amp;#39;s a lot of",1110.843,1.034
stuff that was overblown about this that makes it,1111.877,4.271
out into the media sometimes and gets a,1116.148,1.768
little bit more sensational than it truly is.,1117.916,2.536
But I think the President is obviously very pleased,1120.452,2.469
with the last week that he&amp;#39;s had and the,1122.921,1.869
"accomplishments, especially on the",1124.79,1.335
foreign policy front.,1126.125,0.767
I think we had an unbelievably helpful and,1126.892,3.136
productive meeting with the Chinese.,1130.028,1.836
"His meeting with King Abdullah was unbelievable,",1131.864,2.869
and he&amp;#39;s continued to have very strong foreign policy,1134.733,3.771
wins in terms of the relationships that we&amp;#39;re,1138.504,2.569
making with other heads of state.,1141.073,1.735
The attack on Syria won not just bipartisan praise,1142.808,4.337
"here at home, but world praise.",1147.145,2.036
And I think that he recognizes that sometimes,1149.181,2.869
some of this spills over in these policy,1152.05,2.269
"differences and discussions, and he&amp;#39;s made",1154.319,2.002
sure that the focus stays on advancing the agenda.,1156.321,3.704
"The Press: Sean, thanks.",1160.025,0.734
If you&amp;#39;re saying one of the priorities is to see a,1160.759,2.97
"regime change in Syria, how far is the President",1163.729,2.969
willing to go to see Bashar al-Assad,1166.698,2.67
out of power there?,1169.368,1.368
"Mr. Spicer: So, just to be clear, I can&amp;#39;t -- I don&amp;#39;t",1170.736,2.936
think it&amp;#39;s -- you can&amp;#39;t imagine a stable and,1173.672,3.17
peaceful Syria with Assad in charge.,1176.842,2.269
I just -- I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s a scenario,1179.111,1.735
that&amp;#39;s possible.,1180.846,0.734
But I think that the first step in that has to be to,1181.58,6.173
"make sure that the region -- and Syria, in",1187.753,2.335
particular -- are stable.,1190.088,1.135
You can&amp;#39;t have ISIS marching through Syria and,1191.223,4.604
then worry mostly about who&amp;#39;s in charge right now.,1195.827,2.737
"We&amp;#39;ve got to make sure that, first and foremost,",1198.564,2.102
in terms of our national security -- I think it was,1200.666,1.902
Brian&amp;#39;s question at the beginning -- our national,1202.568,2.235
security is the first and foremost reason,1204.803,1.902
that we have to act.,1206.705,1.235
And as ISIS is proliferating and,1207.94,2.736
chemicals of mass destruction are on the,1210.676,3.27
"rise there, we&amp;#39;ve got to contain that.",1213.946,2.135
"Then once that&amp;#39;s done, I think we can apply",1216.081,2.169
"political, economic, and diplomatic pressure",1218.25,2.669
for a regime change.,1220.919,1.301
"Now, they can work in tandem.",1222.22,2.803
I&amp;#39;m not trying to -- but the bottom line is the,1225.023,2.803
first priority is still the containment of ISIS,1227.826,2.903
and the conflicts that&amp;#39;s occurring.,1230.729,1.869
The Press: And is the red line -- just to clarify --,1232.598,2.435
the red line for this White House -- chemical,1235.033,4.638
warfare -- is conventional warfare enough to get the,1239.671,1.502
President to go further there than this White,1241.173,3.37
House has gone before?,1244.543,1.368
"Mr. Spicer: Look, I think the President has been",1245.911,1.868
very clear that there were a number of lines that,1247.779,1.902
were crossed last week.,1249.681,1.101
He&amp;#39;s not going to sit down -- we saw that in the,1250.782,3.838
last administration.,1254.62,0.734
"They drew these red lines, and then the red lines",1255.354,2.669
were run over.,1258.023,1.268
I don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;re going to see the same play.,1259.291,0.934
I think what not just Syria but the world saw,1260.225,2.736
last week is a President that is going to act,1262.961,2.67
decisively and proportionally and with,1265.631,2.869
justification when it comes to actions like that.,1268.5,1.902
"And I will tell you, the answer is, is that if you",1270.402,3.036
"gas a baby, if you put a barrel bomb in to innocent",1273.438,3.771
"people, I think you can -- you will see a response",1277.209,3.437
from this President.,1280.646,0.734
That is unacceptable.,1281.38,2.002
And I think the rest of the --,1283.382,1.167
The Press: -- bomb?,1284.549,1.535
"Mr. Spicer: I think -- look, again, one of the",1286.084,1.502
"things that I don&amp;#39;t want to start doing, Cecelia,",1287.586,1.935
"is say, if you do this, this is the reaction that",1289.521,2.102
you&amp;#39;re going to get.,1291.623,1.568
The President has made very clear throughout his,1293.191,1.068
"time in the campaign, through the transition,",1294.259,1.835
"and now, as President, that he&amp;#39;s not going to",1296.094,1.902
telegraph a response to every corresponding,1297.996,2.469
"action, because that just tells the opposition or",1300.465,4.538
the enemy what you&amp;#39;re going to do and whether or,1305.003,2.202
not that response is worth taking.,1307.205,2.002
The President is going to be very clear that he&amp;#39;s,1309.207,2.102
going to keep his cards close to the vest.,1311.309,2.603
"But make no mistake, he will act.",1313.912,2.102
John.,1316.014,0.668
"The Press: Thanks a lot, Sean.",1316.682,2.335
I wanted to ask you about the reaction that the,1319.017,2.069
President took in terms of military involvement last week.,1321.086,4.338
You said in your statement that all 59 of those,1325.424,2.702
"cruise missiles hit their intended target, and yet",1328.126,2.536
we&amp;#39;re seeing reports that that military airbase in,1330.662,3.604
Syria continues to be used by the Syrian military.,1334.266,1.701
"Given that, how can you consider that particular",1335.967,4.872
-- a success?,1340.839,2.536
"Mr. Spicer: Well, because I think, from what you&amp;#39;re",1343.375,1.201
"hearing, you&amp;#39;ve taken two pre-fueled planes and",1344.576,2.636
taken them off.,1347.212,1.301
It&amp;#39;s a PR stunt.,1348.513,1.235
The bottom line is their fueling capability has,1349.748,1.735
"been taken out, their radar capability was taken",1351.483,1.935
"out, and over 20 percent of their fixed-wing",1353.418,3.27
aircraft from their entire air force was taken out.,1356.688,2.436
Their ability to operate successfully out of that,1359.124,2.936
airbase is gone.,1362.06,1.702
"Like I said, they -- as a PR stunt, they took some",1363.762,2.602
"pre-fueled planes, pushed them over to make it look",1366.364,2.803
"like nothing is -- but make no mistake about it,",1369.167,2.069
"their radar capability is gone, their fueling",1371.236,2.169
"capability is gone, and a good chunk of their",1373.405,2.169
aircraft is gone.,1375.574,1.301
That&amp;#39;s a huge success.,1376.875,0.934
The Press: I just want to ask you one other question,1377.809,3.671
"following up on what Major Garrett asked, sort of",1381.48,1.901
about these reports of a shake-up at the White House.,1383.381,3.604
There have been various reports that the Deputy,1386.985,3.203
National Security Advisor K.T.,1390.188,1.902
MacFarland is stepping down from that post.,1392.09,2.469
She&amp;#39;ll take on the post of U.S.,1394.559,2.269
ambassador to Singapore.,1396.828,2.336
Can you confirm that?,1399.164,1.868
"And what&amp;#39;s behind that particular move if,",1401.032,1.869
"indeed, that&amp;#39;s the case?",1402.901,2.202
"Mr. Spicer: I appreciate -- look, I&amp;#39;ve said many",1405.103,1.335
times before that we&amp;#39;re not going to get into,1406.438,2.302
personnel announcements until they&amp;#39;re ready to announce.,1408.74,3.437
I would say two points on that.,1412.177,2.869
"One, when General McMaster was announced, it was",1415.046,3.537
pretty clear -- we said it at the time -- you all,1418.583,2.403
"asked the question, whether or not he would",1420.986,1.368
have the ability to shape the National Security,1422.354,1.768
"Council in his liking, with the President&amp;#39;s",1424.122,3.604
concurrence -- I think you&amp;#39;ve pretty much seen,1427.726,2.069
that that was an accurate statement at the time and,1429.795,2.702
it continues to be now.,1432.497,1.402
And General McMaster has the President&amp;#39;s confidence,1433.899,2.869
to ensure that our National Security Council,1436.768,2.536
is shaped in a manner that best serves the President,1439.304,2.603
"of the United States in every way, shape, or form.",1441.907,2.168
"Secondly, to your point -- I think the staff said it",1444.075,2.603
"over the weekend, I&amp;#39;ll reiterate it -- the only",1446.678,1.735
thing that&amp;#39;s being shaken up in Washington right now,1448.413,1.969
is -- or is being shaken up is Washington.,1450.382,2.235
I think this President continues to show that he,1452.617,2.436
is going to be a disrupter and do things differently,1455.053,2.169
and bring real change to Washington.,1457.222,1.668
John Gizzi.,1458.89,1.135
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",1460.025,2.102
Two questions.,1462.127,0.567
"First, the previous administration was in",1463.829,2.635
touch with the Assad opposition and gathered,1466.464,5.439
"conclaves of different groups, including the",1471.903,3.103
Free Syrian Army.,1475.006,1.902
Is this administration in touch with the same,1476.908,3.137
"anti-Assad forces, political and military?",1480.045,2.435
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to go into details on what,1482.48,2.903
we&amp;#39;re doing and who we&amp;#39;re talking to.,1485.383,2.102
I think that obviously didn&amp;#39;t prove too,1487.485,2.803
"successful the last cycle, the last administration,",1490.288,2.369
in terms of regime change.,1492.657,1.035
So I&amp;#39;m going to not get into telegraphing what,1493.692,2.602
we&amp;#39;re doing and how we&amp;#39;re doing it.,1496.294,1.769
"The Press: And on the domestic front,",1498.063,1.201
Congressman Ron DeSantis wrote the President just,1499.264,3.637
"last week to call, in very strong language, for him,",1502.901,3.971
"by executive order, to end what he calls the",1506.872,3.47
OPM rule of 2013.,1510.342,2.836
"That was an executive order, of course, that",1513.178,3.003
"undercut the Affordable Care Act&amp;#39;s amendment,",1516.181,7.007
saying that members of Congress and their staff,1523.188,2.769
could not get healthcare and special subsidies,1525.957,4.471
unlike any other American.,1530.428,6.64
"And he said, as soon as that is eliminated,",1537.068,0.701
Congress will move faster because they and their,1537.769,0.767
staff will not have special treatment.,1538.536,2.236
Is the President going to use his pen and get rid of,1540.772,4.271
the OPM order?,1545.043,1.501
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;ll have to look at that.,1546.544,1.168
I know Secretary Price has been dealing with a lot of it.,1547.712,2.169
I know that&amp;#39;s an OPM order.,1549.881,1.535
Secretary Price has been reviewing all of the,1551.416,3.07
"necessary implementation, documents, and orders with",1554.486,4.271
respect to Obamacare.,1558.757,1.635
I know that he&amp;#39;s working with Director Mulvaney.,1560.392,2.302
"Director Mulvaney, I anticipate, will be here",1562.694,2.135
"with you guys at some point, probably tomorrow,",1564.829,1.836
to talk about some reorganizing,1566.665,1.668
of government.,1568.333,1.234
That might be an appropriate time to talk,1569.567,1.836
to him specifically about that.,1571.403,2.035
Dave.,1573.438,0.667
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1574.105,1.001
The list of judges that the President put out last,1575.106,2.303
"year, saying these are the people I would consider",1577.409,2.402
nominating -- and you referred to earlier -- in,1579.811,2.069
"the end, Democrats still tried to filibuster Judge Gorsuch.",1581.88,4.571
"So what difference, from that perspective, did",1586.451,3.036
putting out that list make in the end?,1589.487,2.47
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s a great question.,1591.957,1.201
"I think what it showed, first and foremost, is the",1593.158,1.902
President kept his word.,1595.06,1.768
The President put out a list of people and,1596.828,2.536
"campaigned on it, and said, if you elect me,",1599.364,2.436
these are the type of justices that,1601.8,1.735
I will choose from.,1603.535,1.401
And they are originalists.,1604.936,2.202
They are going to read and interpret the Constitution,1607.138,1.969
as it was written and meant to be.,1609.107,1.668
"And I think the American people, in a lot of cases",1610.775,3.237
-- if you look at exit polling -- voted for him,1614.012,2.402
in a lot of cases because of that.,1616.414,1.502
"I think it shows that, again, whether or not you",1617.916,2.669
"disagree or agree with the President, sometimes",1620.585,1.702
"philosophically, he gets high marks for keeping his word.",1622.287,3.57
"I think that means a lot, that he went out on a",1625.857,2.769
"number of topics, including the type of",1628.626,2.837
"justice that he would appoint, put it before the",1631.463,3.069
"American people, allowed them to vote up or down",1634.532,2.069
at the ballot box.,1636.601,1.435
And it&amp;#39;s an affirmation of the kind of justice that,1638.036,1.902
"he wants, but it&amp;#39;s also a continuation to know that",1639.938,3.203
the President is going to be someone who makes a,1643.141,2.202
pledge to the American people and keeps it.,1645.343,1.368
The Press: He&amp;#39;s going to obviously have other,1646.711,2.102
federal judges to nominate.,1648.813,1.702
Mr. Spicer: I hope so.,1650.515,2.87
The Press: What else did this process teach him?,1653.385,2.268
Anything?,1655.653,0.901
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think, from a political side, it",1656.554,2.77
was pretty obvious that you can disagree with,1659.324,4.204
"Judge Gorsuch&amp;#39;s judicial philosophy, but I think by",1663.528,4.605
every standard he was a very highly qualified justice.,1668.133,4.271
The American Bar Association rated,1672.404,1.568
him their highest.,1673.972,0.7
"The people who have worked with him in the past, his",1674.672,3.304
judicial record in terms of the number of cases,1677.976,2.903
where he was in the mainstream and Democratic,1680.879,3.77
appointees sided with him.,1684.649,2.035
And I think it basically showed the President that,1686.684,2.436
trying to work Senate Democrats wasn&amp;#39;t really --,1689.12,4.805
was somewhat of a futile task; that these were,1693.925,1.935
"people who made up their mind, by and large,",1695.86,2.069
"regardless of who the person was, they were",1697.929,1.835
going to vote it down.,1699.764,0.801
So that was probably the biggest lesson.,1700.565,5.239
But it also shows that when you&amp;#39;ve got the right,1705.804,1.635
"individual, you&amp;#39;ve got someone who&amp;#39;s eminently",1707.439,2.068
"qualified, we&amp;#39;re going to succeed in getting it done.",1709.507,2.836
Blake.,1712.343,0.801
"The Press: Sean, let me turn your attention to tax",1713.144,2.303
reform real quick.,1715.447,0.767
And I got a few others.,1716.214,1.134
There&amp;#39;s a report out there that says the President,1717.348,2.236
has basically gone back to the drawing board as it,1719.584,3.704
relates to taxes.,1723.288,1.301
Is that accurate?,1724.589,0.868
Mr. Spicer: No.,1725.457,0.7
The Press: Or does he still -- what he put out,1726.157,1.568
"there on the campaign trail, is that still the",1727.725,1.736
backbone of what he wants to see get done?,1729.461,1.534
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, I mean, that&amp;#39;s the backbone.",1730.995,1.435
But I think that what you&amp;#39;re seeing is us going,1732.43,2.703
through this process of his economic team --,1735.133,3.337
everyone from Secretary Mnuchin to Secretary Ross,1738.47,2.836
to Gary Cohn and others sitting down internally,1741.306,5.505
and beginning that process of meeting with groups,1746.811,2.77
that have been advocating for tax reform since 1986,1749.581,5.171
-- kind of the ink of that one dried -- and starting,1754.752,2.737
"to meet with outside groups, industry groups,",1757.489,2.335
"individuals, members of Congress, to get their input.",1759.824,4.004
"This is going to be a major undertaking, and I",1763.828,1.535
"think we want to make sure that we listen, have their",1765.363,3.537
ideas and their input as we move forward.,1768.9,2.336
But this is the beginning phases of that process.,1771.236,2.435
The Press: You mentioned Gary Cohn.,1773.671,1.335
He said on Friday that there&amp;#39;s been this August,1775.006,3.437
deadline that Steve Mnuchin and others,1778.443,1.535
have talked about.,1779.978,0.667
"On Friday, Gary Cohn suggested that August",1780.645,2.035
might not be the deadline.,1782.68,1.902
Is this timeline getting pushed at this point?,1784.582,2.202
"Mr. Spicer: Well, it&amp;#39;s not getting pushed.",1786.784,2.002
I think it&amp;#39;s getting -- obviously that still would,1788.786,2.636
be a great opportunity before they leave for,1791.422,2.803
August recess.,1794.225,0.868
But we&amp;#39;re going to make sure that we do this right,1795.093,1.535
and we do it with the input of all of the,1796.628,2.135
individual groups and members of Congress that,1798.763,2.703
have had a longtime interest in doing this.,1801.466,1.935
"And it is a big deal, right?",1803.401,1.602
You&amp;#39;ve got the ability for our businesses and,1805.003,3.003
industries to be more competitive in the global,1808.006,1.801
"market, and then you want to make sure that you&amp;#39;re",1809.807,1.869
providing middle-income tax relief that creates,1811.676,3.136
economic growth throughout the country.,1814.812,1.335
The Press: Americans are filling out their tax,1816.147,2.169
forms right now for 2016.,1818.316,2.269
"This time, next year, they&amp;#39;re going to fill it",1820.585,1.668
out for 2017.,1822.253,1.335
Will they have a 2017 tax cut this time next year?,1823.588,2.135
Mr. Spicer: I think middle-income Americans I,1825.723,3.003
hope have a tax cut by then.,1828.726,1.235
Jeff.,1829.961,0.634
"The Press: Sean, during the campaign --",1830.595,1.735
"Mr. Spicer: Sorry, it&amp;#39;s --",1832.33,0.567
The Press: Sorry. You can go next.,1832.897,2.002
(Laughter.),1834.899,3.003
Mr. Spicer: Be careful with that.,1837.902,2.503
(Laughter.),1840.405,2.102
"The Press: The President,",1842.507,0.801
"then-candidate Trump, was pretty critical -- or,",1843.308,2.068
excuse me -- was pretty complimentary of,1845.376,1.335
President Putin.,1846.711,1.668
"Now, after seeing how Russia has reacted in",1848.379,2.102
"Syria, what&amp;#39;s his view of President Putin now?",1850.481,2.703
"Mr. Spicer: I think it&amp;#39;s always been the same,",1853.184,1.635
"respectfully, which is that if we can get a deal",1854.819,3.137
"-- we have a shared interest in, particularly",1857.956,1.735
"in the area of ISIS, and if we can defeat them and",1859.691,1.935
"if we can work with them on a plan to defeat them,",1861.626,3.003
then we&amp;#39;re going to do it.,1864.629,0.767
But he&amp;#39;s also said -- and I think sometimes people,1865.396,1.635
"cut off part of the quote, which is if we can&amp;#39;t work",1867.031,2.503
"with them, then, okay.",1869.534,1.768
But the President came into office to really,1871.302,2.736
"focus on two fronts -- keeping our country safe,",1874.038,3.237
and growing our economy and putting,1877.275,1.335
people back to work.,1878.61,0.834
And I think if Russia or any other country can help,1879.444,3.303
us achieve those two goals either through market,1882.747,2.402
access or additional products and services from,1885.149,3.137
"the United States into a major marketplace, but",1888.286,2.903
"more importantly, how to keep our country safe",1891.189,1.735
through a combined effort to defeat something like,1892.924,2.169
"ISIS, especially in a place like Syria where",1895.093,1.701
their planes are (inaudible) -- then I,1896.794,1.769
think we want to work with them.,1898.563,1.334
"But if we can&amp;#39;t get a deal with them, then the",1899.897,3.971
President is not going to be disappointed.,1903.868,2.369
But he would like to do what he can to work with,1906.237,2.302
these individuals to make it happen.,1908.539,1.335
The Press: Would he still describe him in the same,1909.874,2.136
way that he did several months ago as a leader who,1912.01,2.936
he (inaudible) than President Obama?,1914.946,1.368
Mr. Spicer: I think we&amp;#39;ll wait and see.,1916.314,2.002
We&amp;#39;re 81 days in.,1918.316,0.968
I think Secretary Tillerson will have a lot,1919.284,2.035
of information after he meets with Foreign,1921.319,1.535
Secretary Lavrov.,1922.854,1.201
The Press: Can I ask you one other,1924.055,0.567
question on trade?,1924.622,0.868
Mr. Spicer: Yes.,1925.49,1.268
The Press: You mentioned the 100 days that,1926.758,1.801
President and President of China agreed on.,1928.559,3.337
Did China offer to give U.S.,1931.896,2.736
concessions on beef exports and financial,1934.632,2.936
investments as part of that?,1937.568,2.136
"Mr. Spicer: Look, this is an initial working plan",1939.704,3.57
that they&amp;#39;re going to try to hammer out what that,1943.274,2.136
100 days looks like.,1945.41,1.601
And then they call them way stations -- like what,1947.011,3.003
are those stops between a 100 days and now that,1950.014,3.57
would be things that both sides would be looking at.,1953.584,2.303
And I think obviously beef exports and additional,1955.887,2.769
"market access in China, intellectual property, the",1958.656,2.803
"ability to have foreign ownership, especially in",1961.459,3.003
"the services industry, is something that has been",1964.462,3.003
of a prize of U.S.,1967.465,1.568
exporters and industry for a long time.,1969.033,3.237
But it is something that is being hammered out,1972.27,1.902
as we go forward.,1974.172,0.767
"So the plan was to put together a plan, and",1974.939,4.805
there&amp;#39;s a lot of pieces that both sides would like,1979.744,1.935
to see in there and these benchmarks between,1981.679,2.936
now and those 100 days.,1984.615,1.168
But that plan is something that they talked about,1985.783,3.404
putting together during the -- just over the day,1989.187,3.036
that they met together.,1992.223,1.902
And it is something that the counterparts are now,1994.125,1.835
going to continue to flesh out.,1995.96,2.369
So there&amp;#39;s a lot of topics that got put on the table.,1998.329,3.203
We&amp;#39;re going to see how that works.,2001.532,1.468
Jim.,2003,0.801
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",2003.801,0.634
What is the status of the renegotiation of NAFTA?,2004.435,7.608
And what is the White House doing to treat,2012.043,2.402
NAFTA in U.S. interests?,2014.445,2.403
And is there a concern about getting it done,2016.848,2.135
before the Mexican elections heat up at the,2018.983,1.802
end of the year?,2020.785,1.535
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think the first thing with",2022.32,0.767
respect to trade is we need to have the Senate to,2023.087,2.77
approve Robert Lighthizer as the next U.S.,2025.857,1.801
Trade Representative.,2027.658,2.069
That&amp;#39;s obviously -- USTR drives that.,2029.727,3.203
"And so our focus is getting that done, and",2032.93,2.169
then we&amp;#39;ll be ready to go.,2035.099,0.734
We still have an official 90-day notification that,2035.833,2.269
"we have to give Congress, and so once we get",2038.102,3.404
Ambassador Lighthizer confirmed we&amp;#39;ll be ready,2041.506,3.503
to probably announce a better work plan on that.,2045.009,1.735
"But as of right now, that&amp;#39;s not there.",2046.744,1.402
Jeff.,2048.146,3.403
The Press: I just wonder -- when Mr. Trump as a,2051.549,1.835
private citizen had a lot to say about Syria.,2053.384,2.169
One of the things he said that the President -- then,2055.553,1.935
President Obama -- needs to seek,2057.488,2.069
congressional approval.,2059.557,0.868
Some members of Congress believe he should as well.,2060.425,2.635
What is his plan to explain his strategy,2063.06,3.137
in a broader sense?,2066.197,1.401
And why does he not need congressional approval,2067.598,1.735
in this deal?,2069.333,0.201
Mr. Spicer: I think Article 2 of the,2069.534,1.735
Constitution is pretty clear that when it&amp;#39;s in,2071.269,2.369
"the national interest of the country, the President",2073.638,1.835
has the full authority to act.,2075.473,2.135
He did that.,2077.608,1.602
He and his team spoke extensively to,2079.21,1.635
congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle,2080.845,2.836
that night to describe the action that was being,2083.681,2.035
taken forward.,2085.716,1.969
So I think we have fully fulfilled,2087.685,2.102
every obligation.,2089.787,0.701
But the power vested in Article 2 is very clear,2090.488,3.236
with the President&amp;#39;s ability to act.,2093.724,2.403
The Press: In terms of things happening here at,2096.127,1.935
the White House behind the scenes with his staff,2098.062,1.935
"members, obviously there was some ideological and",2099.997,2.269
policy differences on this particular military,2102.266,3.971
action last week.,2106.237,1.335
"Does the President believe, or do you",2107.572,1.835
"believe, that this has been smoothed over in the",2109.407,1.535
"short term, or there has been a long-term solution",2110.942,3.77
"to the fighting between Steve Bannon, Jared",2114.712,2.302
Kushner and others?,2117.014,1.268
Mr. Spicer: Are you talking specifically of,2118.282,1.035
"Syria, or are you talking --",2119.317,1.368
The Press: Specifically,2120.685,1.802
"with Syria, there was a disagreement.",2122.487,0.967
"But is this a short term fix to this problem, or do",2123.454,2.97
"you believe, does the President believe, that",2126.424,1.535
there is a longer-team fix to this infighting that,2127.959,2.302
has really plagued the administration?,2130.261,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: Well, again, I&amp;#39;d say a couple things,",2131.596,1.968
Jeff.,2133.564,0.668
"One is that a lot of this is, frankly, overblown.",2134.232,3.503
"But number two is, the reason the President has",2137.735,2.002
brought this team together is all for a diverse set,2139.737,2.369
of opinions.,2142.106,0.667
He doesn&amp;#39;t want a monolithical kind of,2142.773,2.67
thought process going through the White House.,2145.443,1.501
He wants a diverse set of opinions.,2146.944,1.435
He is the decider.,2148.379,2.069
He has people come in and give him a variety of,2150.448,3.236
options and plans.,2153.684,2.469
He went back and forth over that 72-hour period,2156.153,2.536
"where he wanted additional options, additional",2158.689,2.036
explanations and questions answered.,2160.725,3.904
That&amp;#39;s how he&amp;#39;s going to deal.,2164.629,1.234
"And so whether it&amp;#39;s this, healthcare, tax reform,",2165.863,4.371
"trade, he&amp;#39;s got a divergent set of opinions",2170.234,3.07
here of experts.,2173.304,1.468
The idea isn&amp;#39;t to have one set of thought and policy,2174.772,4.171
"flowing through, it&amp;#39;s to give the President the",2178.943,1.568
"best advice as possible, but that once the",2180.511,2.603
"President makes a decision, that the team is",2183.114,1.701
on board a hundred percent to make sure that we do,2184.815,2.336
what&amp;#39;s in the best interest of the country,2187.151,1.335
and fulfill the agenda he&amp;#39;s laid out.,2188.486,1.568
So I don&amp;#39;t -- I think the President wants to have a,2190.054,5.706
series of ideas and thoughts put forward to him.,2195.76,2.469
That&amp;#39;s how he&amp;#39;s going to make the best opinion --,2198.229,2.369
best decision possible for this country.,2200.598,1.935
The Press: It must have crossed a line if he said,2202.533,2.202

"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think sometimes -- again, I&amp;#39;m",2205.436,1.401
"not going to get into what happens internally, but I",2206.837,2.603
think sometime some things might spill out in the,2209.44,2.302

"Cabinet, among the staff, to make sure that the",2218.783,2.302
"President sees every option that&amp;#39;s available,",2221.085,1.935
every opinion that he should weigh and counter,2223.02,3.17
before he makes a final decision.,2226.19,1.335
`It&amp;#39;s just sometimes I think sometimes those,2227.525,2.169
discussions may come out a little bit more,2229.694,2.435

"But I think -- as I noted in the beginning, I",2233.164,1.835
thought there was a lot of overblown coverage of how,2234.999,3.337
it actually happened and what went down.,2238.336,1.434
The Press: And on sticking with Steve Bannon --,2239.77,1.335
Mr. Spicer: He&amp;#39;s very confident in the team that,2241.105,1.835
"he has, that they have an unbelievable amount of",2242.94,3.604
