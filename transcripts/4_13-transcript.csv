Mr. Spicer: Good afternoon.,0.5,1.268
"As many of you are aware, there&amp;#39;s currently",1.768,2.002
"some news breaking out of Afghanistan, so I just",3.77,1.868
want to give you a quick update.,5.638,1.736
At around 7:00 p.m.,7.374,1.534
"local time in Afghanistan last night, the United States",8.908,3.771
military used a GBU-43 weapon,12.679,3.437
in Afghanistan.,16.116,1.735
"The GBU-43 is a large, powerful and accurately",17.851,3.136
delivered weapon.,20.987,1.502
We targeted a system of tunnels and caves,22.489,2.736
"that ISIS fighters used to move around freely, making it easier",25.225,4.571
for them to target U.S. military advisors and Afghan forces,29.796,3.637
in the area.,33.433,1.168
The United States takes the fight against ISIS,34.601,2.269
very seriously.,36.87,1.301
"And in order to defeat the group, we must deny them",38.171,2.269
"operational space, which we did.",40.44,2.769
The United States took all precautions necessary,43.209,2.236
to prevent civilian casualties and collateral,45.445,3.003
damage as a result of the operation.,48.448,2.235
"Any further details, I would refer you",50.683,1.736
to the Department of Defense on that.,52.419,2.869
"Moving on, as you may know from the schedule,",55.288,2.703
"the President has a 2:00 p.m. event, so I&amp;#39;m going to try",57.991,2.402
to keep this rather tight so the pool has an opportunity,60.393,2.069
to get in and set up appropriately.,62.462,2.569
"Earlier today, the President signed H.J. Res. 43,",65.031,3.303
bringing the total number of Congressional Review Act,68.334,2.67
legislation pieces that he has signed now to 13.,71.004,3.67
This resolution that he signed today overturns,74.674,2.102
a regulation that was put in place by the previous,76.776,2.069
administration on their way out the door that would,78.845,2.536
have taken away the right of states to set,81.381,1.902
their own policies and priorities for Title 10,83.283,3.57
family-planning programs.,86.853,2.169
Our federal system was set up to allow states,89.022,1.902
to address the unique needs of their own populations,90.924,2.469
"when possible, especially -- comes to programs",93.393,2.836
as important and sensitive as family planning.,96.229,3.003
"With the bill signing, the President has restored",99.232,2.336
respect to states&amp;#39; rights on this particular issue.,101.568,3.036
"As I mentioned at the top, there&amp;#39;s an event at 2:00 p.m.",104.604,3.47
where the President will be meeting with the brave,108.074,1.869
first responders who were involved in the I-85 Bridge,109.943,3.803
collapse and thank them -- that occurred,113.746,2.269
in Atlanta to thank them for their work and dedication,116.015,2.703
in addressing this horrible situation.,118.718,3.771
The bridge collapse during rush hour on March 30th --,122.489,3.103
but due to the heroic efforts of Atlanta&amp;#39;s first,125.592,2.302
"responders, some of whom will be here today,",127.894,3.27
no lives were lost.,131.164,1.668
The President is proud to hose these brave,132.832,1.502
individuals and honor their commitment,134.334,1.468
to protecting their community.,135.802,1.835
"Later this afternoon, the President will head",137.637,1.602
to Florida for the Easter holiday.,139.239,2.168
He will be departing Joint Base Andrews,141.407,1.769
"via motorcade, as the preparations for the",143.176,2.536
Easter Egg Roll are well underway on the South,145.712,1.735
"Lawn, preventing a Marine One departure.",147.447,2.536
And while we&amp;#39;re on the topic -- I know it was,149.983,1.468
"brought up the other day, so just to give you quick",151.451,1.802
notes on what to expect this coming Monday.,153.253,2.869
"We expect more than 21,000 people to attend",156.122,2.536
the Easter Egg Roll.,158.658,1.235
The allocations of tickets have been given,159.893,1.668
"to schools, children&amp;#39;s hospitals, and military",161.561,2.669
and law enforcement families.,164.23,1.669
Commemorative eggs will be handed out,165.899,1.668
to the children who attend.,167.567,2.302
"Nearly 18,000 eggs were ordered, which is in line",169.869,2.77
with past years.,172.639,0.867
"The event will start at 7:30 a.m., with different",173.506,2.369
groups of guests arriving every two hours to ensure,175.875,2.336
that all the children have an opportunity to participate,178.211,2.803
in more than a dozen activities,181.014,1.801
that will be available.,182.815,1.235
Further logistics and guidance will be provided,184.05,2.569
over the weekend.,186.619,1.368
"Also, today, the Treasury Department&amp;#39;s Office of",187.987,3.504
"Foreign Asset Control, OFAC, designed --",191.491,3.97
designated one entity and one individual connected,195.461,1.936
to human rights abuses against Iranian political,197.397,2.769
prisoners in Iran&amp;#39;s prisons.,200.166,2.269
The individual who was designated for his role,202.435,2.769
"in abuses in Iran&amp;#39;s prison is the brother of Qasem Soleimani,",205.204,5.906
"the commander of Iran&amp;#39;s IRGC Quds Force,",211.11,4.004
"who was himself previously designated under terrorism,",215.114,3.404
"counter-proliferation, and human rights authorities.",218.518,3.47
The sanctions against human rights abusers,221.988,1.935
in Iran&amp;#39;s prisons come at a time when Iran continues,223.923,3.437
"to unjustly detain in its prison various foreigners,",227.36,3.937
including U.S. citizens Siamuk Namazi and Baquer Namazi.,231.297,4.538
We join recent calls by international,238.605,1.668
organizations and U.N. human rights experts for the immediate,240.273,3.97
release of all U.S. citizens unjustly detained,244.243,3.27
or missing in Iran,247.513,1.202
so that they can return to their families.,248.715,2.402
OFAC also designated two ISIS financial,251.117,2.903
"facilitators and ISIS supporter in North Africa,",254.02,3.971
continuing our ongoing effort to disrupt,257.991,2.535
key leadership nodes for the group.,260.526,2.303
"Moving on, over the past few days, the President",262.829,2.035
and members of the Cabinet have held many meetings,264.864,2.269
and discussions with their international counterparts,267.133,2.503
about the significant foreign policy challenges,269.636,2.302
facing our world.,271.938,1.435
"Yesterday you heard from the President himself,",273.373,1.768
"alongside NATO Secretary General, about the need",275.141,3.504
"for a strong-funded Alliance to combat terrorism,",278.645,3.036
"the humanitarian crisis ongoing in Syria,",281.681,3.57
and many other serious threats to our collective safety,285.251,2.836
and security.,288.087,1.235
"Also, yesterday, Ambassador Nikki Haley,",289.322,1.835
along with her counterparts from nine,291.157,1.635
"other nations, voted in favor of a draft",292.792,2.97
resolution to denounce the heinous chemical attack,295.762,3.637
carried out by the Assad regime last week.,299.399,2.636
"Unfortunately, but not surprising, Russia stood",302.035,2.702
in the way of this resolution.,304.737,1.635
"However, I&amp;#39;d like to point out the abstention",306.372,2.002
"of China, on the heels of President Xi&amp;#39;s recent",308.374,2.336
"successful visit, and Kazakhstan, a longtime",310.71,2.97
Russian ally and former member of the Soviet Union.,313.68,3.336
Both of these abstentions are notable and signify,317.016,2.67
that the United States is persuading the world,319.686,3.036
that the use of weapons of mass destruction cannot,322.722,3.003
go unanswered.,325.725,1.635
"Secretary Tillerson, as you know, was in Russia",327.36,1.902
yesterday to meet with his counterpart and ensure,329.262,2.836
that they are made fully aware of the United,332.098,1.768
States&amp;#39; position in both areas of practical,333.866,2.469
"cooperation, such as defeating ISIS, and areas",336.335,2.803
where Russia does not share our interest,339.138,1.435
and values.,340.573,1.034
"As you know, the Vice President will be",341.607,1.335
"departing for his 10-day trip to South Korea, Japan,",342.942,2.736
Indonesia and Australia on Saturday morning.,345.678,3.003
His office will be providing more information later today.,348.681,3.337
"Finally, I&amp;#39;m glad to announce the President",352.018,2.002
will host the Prime Minister of Italy for an,354.02,2.369
official working visit to the White House,356.389,2.102
"next Thursday, April 20th.",358.491,2.269
"The leaders will discuss the upcoming G7,",360.76,2.669
"which will be hosted in Italy and Sicily, and a range",363.429,4.672
of issues of mutual concern.,368.101,2.068
"With that, I&amp;#39;d be glad to take some of your questions.",370.169,2.002
"The Press: Sean, where is the administration on",372.171,3.437
cost-sharing subsidies for insurance companies?,375.608,3.036
Mr. Spicer: That is an area that is being,378.644,3.37
internally discussed at this time.,382.014,2.236
"The Press: So, undecided?",384.25,1.301
Mr. Spicer: It&amp;#39;s not -- there is an ongoing discussion,385.551,2.97
on that matter.,388.521,0.367
Matt.,388.888,0.667
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",389.555,1.168
The last few days we&amp;#39;ve seen a number of policy,390.723,1.769
"shifts by the President on China is a currency manipulator,",392.492,3.403
"the Ex-Im Bank, the order (inaudible) healthcare taxes.",395.895,3.103
"There&amp;#39;s more, but I won&amp;#39;t belabor the point.",398.998,2.803
What should the American people make of these shifts?,401.801,3.437
And are there any policy areas,405.238,1.601
that are nonnegotiable?,406.839,1.302
"Mr. Spicer: I think -- respectfully, I think you",408.141,3.069
can look at what you&amp;#39;re referring to as a shift,411.21,2.536
in a lot of ways.,413.746,1.168
By that I mean I saw a couple instances with,414.914,2.736
"respect to NATO being one of those shifts yesterday,",417.65,2.803
"and if you look at what&amp;#39;s happened, those entities,",420.453,3.603
"or individuals in some cases, are issues evolving towards",424.056,3.704
the President&amp;#39;s position.,427.76,0.934
"And NATO, in particular, he talked about the need",428.694,3.437
"of countries to pay their fair share, to live up",432.131,3.003
to their commitments of 2 percent of GDP.,435.134,2.269
He talked about the need for NATO to focus,437.403,2.136
more on terrorism.,439.539,1.167
NATO has done just that.,440.706,1.802
And it&amp;#39;s something that he pointed out in the debate --,442.508,2.336
the first debate in September of last year.,444.844,2.135
He talked about the fact that NATO is moving,446.979,3.637
towards what he has been calling for.,450.616,1.435
"And I think in some cases, the issues evolve --",452.051,3.17
that it&amp;#39;s not just a clear and fast statement that this is --,455.221,4.571
the entity itself is moving towards his --,459.792,3.971
or the issue is evolving towards the position,463.763,2.536
that he articulated.,466.299,2.302
And that can&amp;#39;t be proven more true in the case,468.601,1.835
"of NATO, where he laid out two very clear positions",470.436,3.804
"that he had an issue with NATO, and as far back",474.24,2.135
"as September of last year, started to recognize that",476.375,2.736
that institution was moving much more towards his position.,479.111,3.07
The Secretary General noted that as well yesterday.,482.181,2.136
"The Press: A quick follow-up, if I may.",484.317,2.569
The Ex-Im Bank is another one.,486.886,1.802
That&amp;#39;s an institution that hasn&amp;#39;t changed at all.,488.688,1.401
"So, I&amp;#39;m wondering, on some of these other policy",490.089,1.568
shifts where you haven&amp;#39;t seen the type of change,491.657,2.136
"you&amp;#39;re talking about with NATO, what should we make",493.793,2.202
of those kinds of shifts?,495.995,1.568
"And again, are there any policy areas that are",497.563,2.67
"nonnegotiable, that are off limits?",500.233,1.801
"Mr. Spicer: Well, there&amp;#39;s always going to be --",502.034,1.235
"I think that there&amp;#39;s going to be areas where I think,",503.269,3.27
"again, it depends on the outcome.",506.539,1.535
"In the case of NATO, in particular, as I pointed out,",508.074,2.169
it&amp;#39;s the most illustrative.,510.243,1.501
"I think you look at the President&amp;#39;s position,",511.744,2.803
"where he wanted to see NATO, in particular,",514.547,2.703
"evolve to, and it&amp;#39;s moving exactly in the direction",517.25,2.602
that he said it was in terms of its goals,519.852,1.769
of increasing the amount of participation from other,521.621,2.335
"member countries, and, two, as having a greater",523.956,2.236
focus on terrorism -- something that was,526.192,1.601
reinforced by the Secretary General himself,527.793,3.237
when he was here.,531.03,0.934
I think when you look at these issues and you recognize,531.964,2.636
"the direction in which they&amp;#39;re moving,",534.6,2.336
they&amp;#39;re moving in a direction that the,536.936,1.368
President stated very clearly.,538.304,0.867
John.,539.171,0.668
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",539.839,1.935
On the GBU-43 bomb -- the first time it&amp;#39;s ever been used.,541.774,4.304
Why did you choose this particular location?,546.078,3.604
And would you say that this bomb won&amp;#39;t be used,549.682,3.67
again in another flashpoint around,553.352,1.535
"the world, like Syria?",554.887,1.668
"Like North Korea, for instance?",556.555,1.035
"Mr. Spicer: As I noted at the beginning, John,",557.59,2.202
I would refer you to the Department of Defense,559.792,1.802
on the specifics.,561.594,1.668
The Press: On a separate matter -- you mentioned,563.262,2.102
what you see as a win at the U.N. Security Council.,565.364,3.237
I&amp;#39;m curious as to why you believe this is a win.,568.601,3.637
"After all, this particular resolution did not pass --",572.238,3.303
what happened at the U.N.,575.541,2.169
"Security Council in the past, for instance,",577.71,2.302
a Security Council resolution which gave,580.012,2.803
"the green light for the Persian Gulf War,",582.815,2.669
you actually had all five permanent members,585.484,2.436
in the U.N. Security Council voted yes.,587.92,2.903
So why are you saying this is a win when not all five,590.823,4.271
permanent members of the Security Council actually,595.094,2.002
voted yes?,597.096,0.667
You had one -- Russia -- blocking it.,597.763,2.937
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think it&amp;#39;s very significant,",600.7,2.068
"China&amp;#39;s abstention, in particular.",602.768,1.335
"I think Kazakhstan is another one, in terms",604.103,1.969
of that one -- in terms of its proximate location,606.072,1.868
"in history with Russia -- you see a breakaway of Russia,",607.94,3.904
aligning itself with a position that is not only,611.844,2.069
shared with the U.S. but the rest of the world.,613.913,2.202
So that would be a natural position that they might,616.115,2.169
have taken in the past.,618.284,1.668
"But secondly, I think China&amp;#39;s abstention",619.952,1.602
"is a significant win for the President, who went down",621.554,2.436
and had discussions with President Xi -- many of,623.99,4.237
"you all saw that, heard his remarks about how",628.227,2.035
he walked through that.,630.262,2.103
And I think it really shows the success,632.365,2.969
"of the trip, first and foremost, but secondly, it continues",635.334,4.071
to show how Russia is isolated on this particular matter.,639.405,2.703
That&amp;#39;s important.,642.108,1.201
"So, I think on a variety of fronts it really was",643.309,3.103
a huge win for the United States and for the persuasiveness,646.412,2.703
of the President.,649.115,0.667
John Gizzi.,649.782,0.667
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",650.449,2.736
"In his remarks to us off-camera, OMB Director",653.185,4.839
Mulvaney talked about the vision of the federal government,658.024,6.339
"being reorganized as, in some cases, more agencies.",664.363,5.072
And he said also that the final plan will come not,669.435,5.606
just from right-wing think tanks -- I believe that,675.041,2.569
was his phrase.,677.61,1.568
Coupled with the President&amp;#39;s statement,679.178,2.269
"on the Ex-Im Bank, is he already receiving",681.447,3.136
any criticism or voices of disappointment from small,684.583,5.372
government conservatives who backed him strongly?,689.955,2.903
"I refer to groups such as Americans for Tax Reform,",692.858,3.671
or the Cato Institute.,696.529,1.167
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I can&amp;#39;t say that I&amp;#39;ve scanned",697.696,2.803
every group&amp;#39;s statements about this particular,700.499,2.97
"subject, but I can tell you that he&amp;#39;s gotten",703.469,2.035
"a lot of very positive feedback, as well as Director Mulvaney,",705.504,3.27
for their effort.,708.774,1.201
"As the Director noted, you have a government that,",709.975,2.77
"in large part, has never been reorganized,",712.745,2.669
it&amp;#39;s just been added to.,715.414,0.901
And when you look at the different number,716.315,1.668
of agencies and programs that flow throughout,717.983,3.037
"the government to do, in some cases, the very same thing,",721.02,3.537
and are housed in a variety of agencies,724.557,2.636
"throughout the government, the question that you have",727.193,1.701
to ask yourself is not only is the taxpayer,728.894,2.203
"getting the best bang for their buck, but are the people",731.097,2.268
that those services are intended to be,733.365,1.569
providing for getting the best services.,734.934,2.002
"So, Director Mulvaney&amp;#39;s effort, at the President&amp;#39;s",736.936,4.004
"direction, to really look at how government",740.94,2.035
is organized and operating I think is a very,742.975,2.569
significant step.,745.544,1.402
And I think one of the points that he noted,746.946,2.035
is that this is something that should unite,748.981,2.069
"conservatives and liberals, and Republicans",751.05,2.602
"and Democrats -- good government and effective,",753.652,2.87
efficient government is something that really,756.522,2.069
doesn&amp;#39;t have an ideological home.,758.591,1.434
"I think it&amp;#39;s something that we all can agree on,",760.025,1.769
that the more that we can effectively deliver,761.794,3.503
for the American citizen and deliver for the American,765.297,2.736
taxpayer effective and efficient government,768.033,3.37
is something that we should all probably be in line with.,771.403,2.403
Richard.,773.806,0.667
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",774.473,1.535
The U.S. ambassador at the Europe Organization,776.008,2.569
"for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons says that Syria,",778.577,3.871
"he says, uses chemical weapons, embedded -- Syria",782.448,4.771
uses the weapon embedded by Russia&amp;#39;s continuing,787.219,2.503
efforts to bury the truth.,789.722,2.836
Was the President offered proof of such,792.558,4.237
truth-burying efforts by Russia?,796.795,3.003
Mr. Spicer: Was he offered --,799.798,1.202
The Press: Truths of this -- evidence that this,801,2.636
is happening by Russia?,803.636,1.668
Mr. Spicer: No.,805.304,1.368
The Press: I would like to know also -- you&amp;#39;ve been,806.672,1.401
"putting in the same sentence Syria, Iraq and",808.073,2.937
"North Korea as failed states, Russia being",811.01,3.67
"not a failed state, but part of this.",814.68,2.002
Has it become the -- to use an old expression --,816.682,3.403
the axis of evil of this administration?,820.085,2.87
Mr. Spicer: I think it&amp;#39;s important to know who,822.955,2.836
Russia is on the side with right now and where they stand.,825.791,2.403
I think it draws a huge contrast to show who&amp;#39;s,828.194,4.371
on what side of this argument and this crisis.,832.565,3.036
"And I think it&amp;#39;s important to note the difference,",835.601,1.868
that -- who they&amp;#39;re with.,837.469,1.736
And that&amp;#39;s I think a very notable thing.,839.205,1.835
I&amp;#39;m not going to go any further than to say that.,841.04,2.035
"The Press: Very quick, last question.",843.075,1.802
"With the National Hockey League playoffs just started,",844.877,3.87
will the President cheer for the Rangers or the Caps?,848.747,3.304
(Laughter.),852.051,1.101
"Mr. Spicer: Respectfully, that&amp;#39;s really not been a subject",853.152,2.869
that&amp;#39;s come up too often in the White House.,856.021,1.735
(Laughter.),857.756,1.101
"So, I&amp;#39;m going to keep with our Richards and go",858.857,1.369
"to Richard Elliot from WSB TV in Atlanta, Georgia.",860.226,3.57
"The Press: Obviously, our concern is the",863.796,2.202
reconstruction of 85.,865.998,2.102
We understand that the President is meeting,868.1,1.568
with the first responders this afternoon --,869.668,1.769
"in just a few minutes, actually.",871.437,1.334
We wanted to ask about the federal commitment,872.771,2.536
to getting I-85 rebuilt as far as federal dollars and,875.307,3.971
easing some federal regulations to get,879.278,2.569
the job done quickly.,881.847,2.569
"Mr. Spicer: So, a couple things on that front.",884.416,3.737
"Immediately following the tragedy that ensued in Atlanta,",888.153,3.304
the President directed the Federal Highway Administration,891.457,2.402
"to release $10 million, and then we have begun to work",893.859,4.004
with the appropriate agencies to expedite that process.,897.863,4.905
I know that there are critical repairs that have,902.768,3.971
"to get made, and I think that -- not only that the initial",906.739,2.202
funding will help with that for the roads,908.941,2.736
and the bridges and the emergency access that,911.677,1.702
needs to get handled.,913.379,1.434
"But under emergency relief efforts, there are ways",914.813,5.473
to expedite some of that funding.,920.286,1.334
And I would -- the Department of Transportation,921.62,3.203
and the Federal Highway Administration are probably,924.823,1.469
the best way to get a better answer on that.,926.292,2.369
But there are ways that some of that funding can,928.661,1.968
be expedited beyond the initial commitment,930.629,1.769
that the federal government has made.,932.398,1.167
Mary.,933.565,0.935
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",934.5,0.867
Back on some of these shifts.,935.367,1.235
"On China, in particular, the President did not",936.602,1.835
mince words during the campaign.,938.437,1.735
"Now, he says he and President Xi have been",940.172,2.302
"bonding, Xi means well.",942.474,1.836
He says China is not a currency manipulator.,944.31,2.035
What message does this send to the President&amp;#39;s,946.345,2.502
supporters who sent him to the White House thinking,948.847,2.102
he&amp;#39;d be following through on his tough talk against China?,950.949,3.07
Mr. Spicer: I think the President&amp;#39;s tough talk was,954.019,1.735
on a variety of subjects -- was to gets results,955.754,2.937
for the American people.,958.691,1.201
"That&amp;#39;s what he has pledged to do, to get more jobs",959.892,2.869
"here, to grow more manufacturing,",962.761,1.368
to keep our country safe.,964.129,1.435
The President and President Xi,965.564,2.369
had a great meeting.,967.933,1.168
The President likes President Xi and got to know him really well,969.101,3.07
in Mar-a-Lago and I think has established a really good,972.171,2.302
relationship moving forward.,974.473,0.934
"But at the end of the day, this is always",975.407,1.769
about developing a better situation for the American,977.176,2.969
"people, and I think he&amp;#39;s done that.",980.145,1.335
"The Press: And a follow-up, if I may.",981.48,1.335
The President told the Wall Street Journal that,982.815,1.601
President Xi helped him realize that North Korea,984.416,2.536
is not so easy.,986.952,1.268
Did the President underestimate the,988.22,2.035
complexities of this?,990.255,1.102
Did he underestimate how difficult this was going to be?,991.357,1.768
"Mr. Spicer: No, I don&amp;#39;t think so at all.",993.125,1.335
And I think if China is able to help get a deal,994.46,4.204
"with China, the President would appreciate that.",998.664,2.302
I think this would be great for China as well.,1000.966,2.703
"And as the President noted this morning, if China",1003.669,2.135
"can help us do that, it will be great.",1005.804,1.802
"And if not, we&amp;#39;ll go and handle that ourselves",1007.606,2.736
with our allies.,1010.342,1.535
"The Press: Sean, on currency manipulation,",1011.877,1.702
why specifically did he decide to abandon this?,1013.579,4.037
And what other tools does he have in his toolbox,1017.616,2.836
to try to modify China&amp;#39;s trade --,1020.452,2.169
"Mr. Spicer: I think that&amp;#39;s a very, very complex issue",1022.621,1.835
and I think the President -- I&amp;#39;m going to leave it,1024.456,1.368
to the President to specifically answer that.,1025.824,2.136
The Press: Has he given up on trying to modify,1027.96,2.769
China&amp;#39;s trade behavior?,1030.729,1.535
Mr. Spicer: I think the President is going to continue,1032.264,1.268
to make significant progress when it comes to that issue,1033.532,2.769
and to how our relationship is with China.,1036.301,1.936
He showed already what a great relationship he has,1038.237,4.004
"with President Xi, and the results are starting to pour in.",1042.241,4.137
And I think that that is an issue in particular,1046.378,1.869
that the President is best to address.,1048.247,2.569
"The Press: Two questions, Sean.",1050.816,1.935
You were very forthcoming about the tick-tock,1052.751,2.036
"leading up to the missile launch into Syria, so can",1054.787,3.169
you give us any background on the MOAB,1057.956,1.802
in Afghanistan?,1059.758,1.168
Was there a Situation Room scenario?,1060.926,2.102
Was the President -- was this several days in the making?,1063.028,2.903
"And my second question is, the President has been",1065.931,2.536
very critical of the intelligence community,1068.467,2.669
leading up to his inauguration.,1071.136,2.069
He&amp;#39;s obviously been working very closely,1073.205,1.668
with the intel community on these -- at least,1074.873,2.77
on these situations in Syria and Afghanistan.,1077.643,2.435
Has his opinion changed toward the IC?,1080.078,3.104
"Mr. Spicer: In the first question, again, I think",1083.182,2.902
General Nicholson at United States Forces,1086.084,2.036
Afghanistan is best to address the tick-tock,1088.12,2.336
on the situation over there.,1090.456,2.135
The Press: But as far as the President&amp;#39;s consultation.,1092.591,1.969
Mr. Spicer: I understand.,1094.56,0.967
I think that the U.S. Forces Afghanistan as well as,1095.527,3.37
the Department of Defense are best to walk through,1098.897,2.403
the military operations that are ongoing there.,1101.3,2.802
I think with respect to the intelligence community,1104.102,2.737
"and the national security team, as you know,",1106.839,2.235
the President has put together a world-class Cabinet,1109.074,2.536
"of top-notch national security experts, from",1111.61,2.769
"General Mattis to General Kelly, General McMaster",1114.379,3.637
"and others, that continue to provide him the best",1118.016,3.103
advice to make the best decisions for this country.,1121.119,3.537
And he continues to rely on them -- and Director,1124.656,1.902
"Pompeo, Director Coats at the DNI.",1126.558,2.836
They continue to give him sage advice about how,1129.394,2.47
to best position the United States.,1131.864,2.636
Zeke.,1134.5,0.934
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1135.434,0.967
"Following up on that question, did the",1136.401,1.502
President specifically order -- authorize the use,1137.903,2.235
of this piece of ordnance?,1140.138,1.535
"Mr. Spicer: Again, I&amp;#39;m not going to get into",1141.673,1.101
details right now.,1142.774,2.303
"As I mentioned, I&amp;#39;ll let the Department of Defense",1145.077,4.538
handle the lead on this one.,1149.615,1.334
"The Press: And to follow up on a question earlier,",1150.949,3.904
you didn&amp;#39;t answer specifically what has changed about,1154.853,1.969
the Ex-Im Bank that has led the President to re-evaluate,1156.822,2.569
his previous --,1159.391,1.201
Mr. Spicer: Let me get back to you on the Ex-Im,1160.592,0.968
Bank specifically.,1161.56,1.034
I think it&amp;#39;s a very complex issue,1162.594,2.369
and I would like to get back.,1164.963,1.502
Anita.,1166.465,1.168
The Press: Two questions about the budget.,1167.633,1.868
Are you all prepared to hold things up?,1169.501,2.202
We&amp;#39;ve got a couple weeks left here.,1171.703,1.802
How serious are you about getting money for the wall?,1173.505,3.037
Would you hold up the spending plan for that?,1176.542,2.402
And I have one other question.,1178.944,1.868
"The Press: So, the government is currently",1180.812,2.269
funded through April 28th under a continuing resolution.,1183.081,3.404
We&amp;#39;ve made very clear to Congress that the,1186.485,2.402
President&amp;#39;s priorities are increasing military,1188.887,1.735
spending and security of our border.,1190.622,1.936
"We&amp;#39;re going to continue to have conversations with Congress,",1192.558,2.402
and we feel confident that they&amp;#39;ll do their job.,1194.96,2.269
But those conversations are ongoing.,1197.229,1.335
"The Press: So, you can&amp;#39;t say whether you would have to have",1198.564,2.168
money in this budget or --,1200.732,1.135
Mr. Spicer: I will leave it to our team to continue,1201.867,3.136
the negotiations that they&amp;#39;re having.,1205.003,1.502
The Press: Okay.,1206.505,0.901
And then the second question on the budget,1207.406,1.234
"was, there&amp;#39;s a proposal now to punish members of",1208.64,3.47
"Congress who do not pass this spending plan,",1212.11,2.87
"in a variety of ways -- withhold salary, even arrest.",1214.98,3.303
Do you support that Congress should be punished --,1218.283,4.371
Mr. Spicer: Let&amp;#39;s see.,1222.654,1.302
I think we&amp;#39;re making significant progress.,1223.956,2.302
I feel very good about the momentum and so I don&amp;#39;t,1226.258,2.269
want to start getting into whether -- who&amp;#39;s going,1228.527,2.269
to be naughty and nice.,1230.796,1.001
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",1231.797,1.802
"Historically, sitting Presidents have refrained",1233.599,2.902
from stating preferences on -- free-market economy goes.,1236.501,3.504
"Yesterday, President Trump said he wants low interest rates",1240.005,2.669
"and he wants a weaker dollar, and then the market followed",1242.674,3.037
his preferences.,1245.711,1.268
So given his criticism of other economies and their,1246.979,2.102
"intervention, how do you characterize that response?",1249.081,3.003
Mr. Spicer: I think the President has made it very,1252.084,2.135
clear from the beginning that he&amp;#39;s going to do what,1254.219,2.035
he can to fight on behalf of American consumers,1256.254,2.603
and American businesses to make sure that we can help,1258.857,2.936
create an environment here in America where,1261.793,3.337
businesses grow and industries continue,1265.13,2.803
"to hire, jobs can come back and middle-income",1267.933,2.569
Americans can get some tax relief and keep more,1270.502,2.903
of their money and their hard-earned dollars.,1273.405,1.969
"The Press: But, traditionally, you have low interest rates",1275.374,1.735
"when the economy is weak and needs help, and then they",1277.109,2.068
recover when the economy strengthens.,1279.177,1.836
"So, what was he trying to get --",1281.013,1.835
Mr. Spicer: I understand.,1282.848,0.934
"I think what he is trying to do, as you know,",1283.782,2.269
through a lot of the coverage and a lot,1286.051,1.501
of the meetings that you guys have covered and seen here,1287.552,3.604
"at the White House, the President is continuing",1291.156,1.468
to meet with business leaders and people who are creating,1292.624,2.536
"jobs, union leaders, to find out what we can do.",1295.16,2.87
And the President has heard a lot -- gotten a,1298.03,3.103
lot of feedback and already taken great steps,1301.133,2.536
to make sure that we can create a regulatory,1303.669,3.136
and tax environment that&amp;#39;s going to help grow,1306.805,2.236
America&amp;#39;s economy and put people back to work.,1309.041,2.135
That&amp;#39;s plain and simple.,1311.176,1.068
And I think what he&amp;#39;ll continue to do is fight,1312.244,1.668
on behalf of the American people.,1313.912,1.335
I hate to cut this short but we literally have 10 minutes,1315.247,2.102
before the President is supposed to speak.,1317.349,2.035
Thank you very much.,1319.384,2.236
