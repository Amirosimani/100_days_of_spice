"Mr. Spicer: Good afternoon, everybody.",2.969,1.435
I hope those who celebrated had a great,4.404,2.302
Easter holiday and have had a chance to go out,6.706,2.302
and check out the activity on the South Lawn.,9.008,1.769
We&amp;#39;ve got a few waves still to go.,10.777,2.469
The President and the First Lady welcomed,13.246,2.436
thousands of families here to the White House,15.682,1.368
this morning for the 139th Annual Easter Egg Roll.,17.05,3.77
"When it&amp;#39;s all said and done, we will have had",20.82,1.569
"thousands of guests, including many active-duty",22.389,2.235
"military, veterans, families, children from",24.624,2.77
"local schools, patients from local children&amp;#39;s",27.394,2.535
"hospitals, all here to share in this historic event.",29.929,3.904
"Right about now, the President is finishing up",33.833,2.303
his regular meeting with the Secretary of State.,36.136,2.969
"The Vice President, of course, is currently",39.105,1.969
"on a 10-day trip visiting South Korea, Japan, Indonesia,",41.074,3.97
and Australia.,45.044,1.168
"While in South Korea, the Vice President",46.212,2.002
participated in an Easter church service with both,48.214,2.203
American and South Korean servicemembers and their,50.417,2.502
"families, and has been holding bilateral meetings",52.919,2.569
with representatives of the South Korean government.,55.488,2.403
The Vice President is delivering a message,57.891,1.468
to the people of the Republic of Korea on behalf,59.359,1.902
"of the President that even in these troubled times,",61.261,3.303
the United States stands with them for a free,64.564,2.336
and secure future.,66.9,1.868
"Under President Trump, our ironclad alliance will be",68.768,3.537
"even stronger, our nations will be safer,",72.305,3.303
and the Asia Pacific region will be more secure.,75.608,3.337
"From South Korea, the Vice President will head to Japan.",78.945,2.469
I&amp;#39;ll continue to provide updates as they warrant,81.414,3.303
during the Vice President&amp;#39;s trip throughout the rest of the week.,84.717,2.67
"Looking ahead, tomorrow the President heads",87.387,1.935
"to Wisconsin, where he&amp;#39;ll talk about his &amp;quot;Buy America,",89.322,2.97
"Hire America&amp;quot; agenda at Snap-on Tools in Kenosha, Wisconsin.",92.292,3.637
"For those of you who aren&amp;#39;t aware, Snap-on",95.929,2.769
is a prime example of a company that builds American-made,98.698,2.503
tools with American workers for U.S. taxpayers.,101.201,3.603
We&amp;#39;ll be having a background briefing here,104.804,1.835
"in this room, later this afternoon, with senior",106.639,1.735
administration officials regarding the details,108.374,2.369
of the trip.,110.743,1.001
Further guidance should be coming out,111.744,1.602
in your inboxes momentarily.,113.346,2.035
"On Wednesday, the President will sign",115.381,1.735
the Veterans Choice Program Extension and Improvement Act.,117.116,3.704
"The President is proud to sign this legislation,",120.82,3.47
which passed unanimously by the Senate earlier this month.,124.29,3.204
The bill ensures that veterans have certainty,127.494,2.535
and continuity of care while this administration,130.029,2.736
works with Congress to develop a plan that,132.765,2.403
reforms the VA system and gives our nation&amp;#39;s heroes,135.168,3.07
the care that they deserve.,138.238,1.668
He&amp;#39;ll also host the New England Patriots this,139.906,2.669
Wednesday to congratulate them on their fifth,142.575,2.636
Super Bowl win.,145.211,0.834
"And, on Thursday, the Prime Minister of Italy",146.045,3.137
will be here for an official visit.,149.182,2.035
"And with that, I&amp;#39;ll kick it off to the birthday boy,",151.217,4.138
Mr. Jim Acosta.,155.355,1.835
The Press: I&amp;#39;ll take it.,157.19,0.767
"Thank you, Sean.",157.957,1.702
Does the President have a red line when it comes,159.659,2.436
"to North Korea that, if they cross it, they will bring",162.095,3.67
about some kind of military response from the U.S.?,165.765,2.97
Mr. Spicer: I think when we talked about the use,168.735,3.737
of red lines in the past with respect to Syria --,172.472,2.169
the President&amp;#39;s red line -- that drawing red lines hasn&amp;#39;t really,174.641,3.336
worked in the past.,177.977,1.535
"He holds his cards close to the vest, and you&amp;#39;re",179.512,2.469
not going to see him telegraphing how he&amp;#39;s going,181.981,2.57
to respond to any military or other,184.551,2.035
situation going forward.,186.586,1.501
That&amp;#39;s just something that he believes has not served,188.087,2.87
us well in the past.,190.957,1.301
"We did this with Mosul, where we started to talk",192.258,1.669
about what the action will be months in advance.,193.927,2.769
And it really gives the intended recipient,196.696,3.904
of action a heads-up as to what&amp;#39;s going on.,200.6,1.935
"So, I don&amp;#39;t think that you&amp;#39;re going to see the",202.535,2.169
"President drawing red lines in the sand,",204.704,1.602
"but I think that the action that he took in Syria shows that,",206.306,3.47
"when appropriate, this President will take decisive action.",209.776,2.369
"The Press: Just to follow up on that, Syria is one thing",212.145,3.97
"and North Korea is quite another, when they",216.115,2.036
have nuclear ambitions the way that they do.,218.151,1.768
"When you talk about, &amp;quot;Well, we did this to",219.919,2.069
"Syria and we did this to Afghanistan,&amp;quot; is that",221.988,5.272
being a little too loose with bombastic rhetoric?,227.26,3.103
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, no.",230.363,1.068
"And again, please don&amp;#39;t read too much into that",231.431,2.002
in terms of trying to make an analogy on the action;,233.433,2.469
I think it&amp;#39;s quite the opposite.,235.902,1.902
"But I think with respect to North Korea in particular,",237.804,2.669
the President had a really good meeting,240.473,2.636
with President Xi down in Mar-a-Lago where I think,243.109,2.569
he&amp;#39;s spoken extensively about the relationship,245.678,2.436
that they made down there and that they continue,248.114,4.438
to work to improve.,252.552,1.368
And the results of that are paying off.,253.92,1.635
I think you see China playing a much more active,255.555,3.437
role with respect to North Korea both politically,258.992,4.437
"and economically, that they can continue to apply pressure",263.429,3.904
to achieve results.,267.333,1.001
And I think we&amp;#39;re going to continue to urge China,268.334,2.369
to exhibit its influence in the region to get better results.,270.703,3.203
The Press: But North Korea did launch that missile.,273.906,1.602
They did launch it.,275.508,0.667
Mr. Spicer: I understand that.,276.175,1.235
And it failed.,277.41,1.168
We&amp;#39;re well aware of what&amp;#39;s going on.,278.578,2.602
We monitored that situation.,281.18,0.968
"The President was kept up to date, as you know.",282.148,1.568
But I think that we&amp;#39;re going to continue to work,283.716,2.369
with China in particular to help find a way forward on this.,286.085,2.77
John.,288.855,1.067
"The Press: Thanks a lot, Sean.",289.922,1.001
"The President, as you just mentioned, has spoken",290.923,1.469
about this relationship that he&amp;#39;s developed,292.392,2.469
"with President Xi, where President Xi would be",294.861,2.903
leaning on the North Korean government,297.764,1.868
"to prevent the kind of attempted missile launches,",299.632,3.137
like we saw over the weekend.,302.769,1.835
It seems as if that effort in terms of leaning on,304.604,3.537
North Korea did not work.,308.141,2.669
"In addition to that, the Vice Foreign Minister",310.81,2.769
of North Korea said to the BBC today that North Korea,313.579,4.638
"will test its missiles on a weekly, a monthly,",318.217,2.903
and a yearly basis.,321.12,1.335
"So, my question is, what kind of pressure is China",322.455,3.103
putting on North Korea?,325.558,1.168
"Mr. Spicer: Well, again, I think this goes back",326.726,1.101
"to the nut of what Jim was asking, which is, I think",327.827,2.302
for us to telegraph what we&amp;#39;re going to do or what,330.129,2.703
we&amp;#39;re going to ask others to do would not be a smart,332.832,3.036
strategy to lay it all out in public.,335.868,1.502
"But I think that if you realize -- for example,",337.37,3.603
"on the economic side of things, China is the",340.973,2.803
number-one importer of North Korean coal.,343.776,2.937
I think to see them curtail some of that has,346.713,3.837
a real economic impact on the region.,350.55,2.836
There&amp;#39;s a lot of economic and political pressure,353.386,1.902
"points that I think China can utilize, and we&amp;#39;ve",355.288,3.303
been very encouraged with the direction,358.591,1.535
in which they&amp;#39;re going.,360.126,1.301
"The Press: But North Korea is essentially, just based",361.427,2.936
"upon what they tried to do over the weekend, thumbing",364.363,2.57
its nose at even China because of what they,366.933,3.77
attempted to do.,370.703,1.568
Mr. Spicer: And I understand that question.,372.271,2.102
I think we&amp;#39;re just not there yet.,374.373,1.736
We&amp;#39;ve got a lot of tools left and a lot,376.109,2.002
of conversations that are ongoing.,378.111,1.334
But let&amp;#39;s not get ahead of ourselves.,379.445,2.269
I think we&amp;#39;ve had a very productive direction that,381.714,4.671
"we&amp;#39;ve seen China move in, and I think there&amp;#39;s an",386.385,2.436
"agreement, I think by everyone so far, that",388.821,3.003
a nuclear capable North Korea is not in anybody&amp;#39;s,391.824,4.505
best interest.,396.329,0.867
And I think we&amp;#39;re going to continue to work with,397.196,1.135
the Chinese in particular on this case.,398.331,1.835
Kaitlan.,400.166,1.201
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",401.367,0.968
What was their view of the White House visitor logs?,402.335,1.835
What&amp;#39;s the extent of that review?,404.17,2.102
"Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sorry, what was --",406.272,1.235
The Press: What was the extent of their view,407.507,1.434
of the White House visitor logs?,408.941,1.202
What made you change your mind to not continue,410.143,2.135
releasing them?,412.278,1.435
"Mr. Spicer: I think as was noted on Friday, we&amp;#39;re",413.713,2.936
following the same policy that every administration,416.649,2.169
from the beginning of time has used with respect,418.818,2.202
to visitor logs.,421.02,1.135
We will comply with both the Federal Records Act,422.155,1.901
and the Presidential Records Act as stated by law.,424.056,4.438
"The Press: So, why does the President object",428.494,1.468
to people knowing who is coming in the White House?,429.962,1.502
Mr. Spicer: It&amp;#39;s not a question of objecting.,431.464,1.134
It&amp;#39;s about following the law.,432.598,1.635
We&amp;#39;re following the law as both the Presidential Records Act,434.233,3.971
and the Federal Records Act prescribe it.,438.204,1.969
"So, it&amp;#39;s the same policy that every administration",440.173,2.602
"had up until the Obama administration, and,",442.775,2.236
"frankly, the faux attempt that the Obama",445.011,3.036
"administration put out, where they would scrub",448.047,1.802
"what they didn&amp;#39;t want put out, didn&amp;#39;t serve anyone well.",449.849,3.503
The President wants to make sure that people can,453.352,1.735
come in the same way that they can go into a member,455.087,1.702
"of Congress&amp;#39;s office, provide information and details.",456.789,3.037
And there&amp;#39;s people who want to be able to come,459.826,4.104
"have that conversation with members of the administration,",463.93,3.236
the same way that they would do with members of Congress --,467.166,1.902
go into their office --,469.068,1.368
The Press: But why didn&amp;#39;t he take this opportunity,470.436,1.068
to one-up the transparency game?,471.504,2.903
If Obama was so bad at it --,474.407,1.401
Mr. Spicer: Because -- I think I&amp;#39;m trying to explain that,475.808,1.402
to you -- I think that we recognize that there&amp;#39;s a privacy,477.21,1.835
aspect to allowing citizens to come express their views.,479.045,2.669
And that&amp;#39;s why we maintain the same policy that every,481.714,2.636
other administration did coming up here prior,484.35,2.469
to the last one.,486.819,0.901
"And the last one, frankly, was a faux level of doing",487.72,2.402
"that, because when you go through and you scrub",490.122,1.702
everyone&amp;#39;s name out that you don&amp;#39;t want everyone,491.824,1.635
"to know, that really is not an honest attempt at doing it.",493.459,3.437
We are going to follow the law the way that every,496.896,3.003
administration has followed up until the last one.,499.899,2.736
Zeke.,502.635,1.568
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",504.203,1.035
"Following on Kaitlan&amp;#39;s question, the rationale",505.238,2.969
given Friday for the visitor logs reversal,508.207,3.037
was for national security and privacy concerns.,511.244,2.502
Both of those were clear exemptions in the Obama,513.746,2.035
administration&amp;#39;s policy which led to that,515.781,1.469
scrubbing that you described.,517.25,1.568
"So, why exactly the reversal?",518.818,1.868
You seem to be describing maybe a third rationale,520.686,2.136
that you&amp;#39;re giving.,522.822,1.435
"Mr. Spicer: No, I think I just touched on privacy,",524.257,2.736
that people have a right --,526.993,0.901
The Press: The Obama administration had that,527.894,1.668
exception to their visitor logs.,529.562,1.435
"Mr. Spicer: But I think the problem, Zeke, is that",530.997,2.002
"we don&amp;#39;t know what the -- I mean, they said what it",532.999,3.103
"was, but you don&amp;#39;t know who got left off and who didn&amp;#39;t.",536.102,2.569
They chose to not put people out for whatever,538.671,3.537
"reason, and they gave an excuse and no one questioned it.",542.208,2.869
"So, the question is -- but I think the bottom line",545.077,2.369
"is, as I said to Kaitlan, is that we&amp;#39;re going to",547.446,3.571
have the same policy that every President has had,551.017,4.437
through time and comply with the law on both fronts.,555.454,3.771
"But again, you remember -- it&amp;#39;s interesting that",559.225,3.403
we&amp;#39;re following basically the same thing that,562.628,1.535
members of Congress follow.,564.163,1.735
You go in and you meet with a member of Congress,565.898,1.468
"right now, that there&amp;#39;s an option for people to go in",567.366,2.703
and express their opinion.,570.069,0.934
"If they want to make it public, who&amp;#39;s meeting with",571.003,3.037
"them -- and in a lot of cases we do, we bring",574.04,1.801
in you guys to probably a greater extent than has,575.841,2.503
happened before in terms of the pool spray.,578.344,1.368
We list participant lists.,579.712,2.269
But I think there&amp;#39;s an opportunity sometimes,581.981,1.335
for American people who want to come in and have,583.316,2.569
a conversation and not become -- and be able,585.885,3.203
to share their view.,589.088,1.101
"So, again -- but remember, this is the same policy",590.189,3.237
that every President and every administration has followed.,593.426,2.969
The Press: I&amp;#39;ll grant you that --,596.395,1.735
Mr. Spicer: Thank you.,598.13,1.068
The Press: -- but this President entered office,599.198,1.468
running a campaign saying he was going to &amp;quot;drain the swamp.&amp;quot;,600.666,2.069
"So, under this existing policy, a lobbyist --",602.735,2.97
the President has decried on the campaign trail --,605.705,3.169
"Washington insider, members of the swamp",608.874,4.004
can walk into the White House and there is no recourse for,612.878,2.636
the public to hold the President to account --,615.514,1.569
Mr. Spicer: I think you guys -- but the visitor logs,617.083,3.27
to all the White House components --,620.353,2.502
"OMB, the Council of Economic Equality, U.S. Trade",622.855,2.169
"Representative, Office of Science and Technology --",625.024,2.769
The Press: (Inaudible.),627.793,0.968
Mr. Spicer: Huh?,628.761,1.101
What I&amp;#39;m saying is all those are subject,629.862,1.502
to the Federal Records Act.,631.364,1.067
We&amp;#39;re complying with all that and we&amp;#39;re complying,632.431,1.101
with the Presidential Record Act.,633.532,1.569
"My point is, that, look, this is the policy that&amp;#39;s",635.101,2.702
existed from the beginning of time since they were,637.803,2.269
kept through the last one.,640.072,1.969
And the last one was a faux attempt at that.,642.041,2.102
"Again, it&amp;#39;s not really being transparent when",644.143,2.236
you scrub out the names of the people that you don&amp;#39;t want,646.379,2.302
anyone to know were here.,648.681,1.468
And so I think that we&amp;#39;ve made a decision to stay,650.149,3.17
in line with the law and follow the same procedures,653.319,2.069
that everyone else has maintained.,655.388,2.168
Trey.,657.556,1.035
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",658.591,1.368
"On North Korea, is the President prepared to act alone,",659.959,1.768
or does he feel that Congress should be somehow involved,661.727,3.37
in the process if any decision that includes,665.097,2.703
the use of force is made?,667.8,2.169
Mr. Spicer: I think he&amp;#39;s going to utilize,669.969,2.636
the powers under Article II of the Constitution.,672.605,2.669
I think what you saw with respect to the action that,675.274,3.137
"he had with Syria, he made sure that members",678.411,3.269
"of Congress were notified of his action in a very,",681.68,3.404
very short amount of time.,685.084,1.335
We&amp;#39;re going to continue to seek their input on the policy,686.419,2.836
overall and then make sure that they&amp;#39;re notified.,689.255,3.203
We&amp;#39;ll do that.,692.458,1.168
But I think the bigger consultation issue is what,693.626,2.269
we do with the larger world community and have,695.895,1.668
"that dialogue, as I mentioned earlier, to make",697.563,2.202
sure that every country that can is putting,699.765,3.537
the appropriate level of economic and political,703.302,2.069
pressure on North Korea to act in a way that helps us.,705.371,4.538
Eamon.,709.909,1.468
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",711.377,1.268
"With tax filing day coming up, is the President going",712.645,2.402
"to release his 2016 tax returns, given that we can",715.047,3.337
"assume, maybe, that those are not themselves under",718.384,2.602
"audit, which is the --",720.986,1.168
"Mr. Spicer: No, you can&amp;#39;t, they are.",722.154,2.002
I think it&amp;#39;s been covered before.,724.156,1.468
It&amp;#39;s the same thing that was discussed during,725.624,2.736
the campaign trail.,728.36,0.668
The President is under audit.,729.028,1.768
It&amp;#39;s a routine one that continues.,730.796,2.503
And I think that the American public know,733.299,2.369
clearly where he stands.,735.668,0.867
This was something that he made very clear during,736.535,1.569
the election cycle.,738.104,1.234
The Press: And to --,739.338,1.068
"Mr. Spicer: Hold on, and then so -- and the one time that it",740.406,2.569
"was done, I think the people understand how successful",742.975,2.536
the President has been and how much he&amp;#39;s paid in taxes.,745.511,3.804
"But we&amp;#39;re under the same audit that existed,",749.315,2.702
and so nothing has changed.,752.017,1.802
"The Press: And as you know, the IRS never",753.819,1.502
comments on individual taxpayer information.,755.321,1.968
This obviously is an extraordinary case,757.289,1.969
involving the President of the United States.,759.258,1.902
"The President could authorize the IRS,",761.16,1.935
"presumably, to go ahead and confirm that he&amp;#39;s",763.095,2.369
under audit and to give us some details about that,765.464,2.336
"audit -- what years, how long is this expected",767.8,2.803
"to take, et cetera.",770.603,1.167
Will the President authorize the IRS,771.77,1.702
to confirm that he is indeed under audit?,773.472,1.835
Mr. Spicer: I think the President&amp;#39;s view on this,775.307,1.502
"has been very clear from the campaign, and the American",776.809,1.468
people understood it when they elected him in November.,778.277,3.737
Hallie.,782.014,1.535
The Press: You got a fly on your head.,783.549,1.468
Mr. Spicer: Thank you.,785.017,0.968
"Always looking out for me, John Roberts.",785.985,2.068
The Press: Political leaders in Hawaii,788.053,3.137
are reviewing plans -- emergency plans in case,791.19,3.804
they are attacked.,794.994,1.334
Does the President believe that the level of tension,796.328,2.903
between the United States and North Korea is at the point,799.231,2.636
where we should start reviewing emergency attack plans?,801.867,2.169
"Mr. Spicer: So, just to be clear -- and again,",804.036,2.97
I&amp;#39;m not going to get into -- I would just tell you that,807.006,3.069
there are military contingency plans for,810.075,1.502
"almost every scenario, in numerous aspects around",811.577,5.806
"the world, here at home -- everything",817.383,3.236
"from humanitarian relief to refugee crises,",820.619,2.836
to attacks.,823.455,1.168
That is standard military procedure to have those,824.623,2.202
kinds of things.,826.825,1.135
"So, to make that in any way, shape or form sound",827.96,2.669
new would be a mistake.,830.629,1.702
It is a standard operating procedure of the military,832.331,2.269
"to plan for contingencies in a number of operations,",834.6,3.003
in a number of hotspots throughout the world,837.603,2.436
on a regular basis.,840.039,0.967
"And with respect to Korea, in particular, that&amp;#39;s been",841.006,2.403
going on for decades.,843.409,1.935
"The Press: Sean, how high does the President view",845.344,2.369
the threat level from North Korea?,847.713,0.934
"Mr. Spicer: Again, I think the President has made",848.647,2.069
clear we&amp;#39;re aware of the activities that they&amp;#39;ve,850.716,3.27
"engaged in, and we&amp;#39;re monitoring them.",853.986,2.536
And the national security team continues,856.522,2.002
to keep him up to date.,858.524,0.901
The Press: Just one more on that topic.,859.425,1.535
One of the reasons why successive administrations,860.96,2.002
have chosen to negotiate with the leaders of North,862.962,2.469
Korea is because it&amp;#39;s believed that there,865.431,1.902
are no good military options to deal with it.,867.333,3.003
Does this President believe that there are,870.336,1.668
viable military options for dealing with North Korea?,872.004,3.103
Mr. Spicer: Again --,875.107,1.135
The Press: Without telegraphing what --,876.242,1.401
"Mr. Spicer: I understand, but I think taking anything on or",877.643,1.868
off the table is in itself limiting your options,879.511,4.138
to some degree.,883.649,2.402
"And so, I&amp;#39;m not going to even discuss that.",886.051,1.202
Julie.,887.253,1.234
The Press: I wanted to ask you a couple of questions,888.487,1.468
about the situation in Turkey.,889.955,1.302
Is the President concerned at all about the reports,891.257,1.301
from international monitors that this,892.558,1.802
referendum that gives President Erdogan these,894.36,1.935
sweeping powers have irregularities in it?,896.295,1.535
Mr. Spicer: My understanding is there&amp;#39;s an international,897.83,2.135
commission that is reviewing this and issues a report,899.965,3.637
in 10 to 12 days.,903.602,0.801
"And so, we&amp;#39;ll wait and let them do their job.",904.403,2.035
There were international monitors throughout Turkey,906.438,3.037
and we&amp;#39;ll let --,909.475,1.001
The Press: And what would he like to see Erdogan do?,910.476,1.101
Would he like to see a hold right now while,911.577,1.835
that review happens?,913.412,1.301
Mr. Spicer: I think at this point -- I don&amp;#39;t think --,914.713,1.435
I think we&amp;#39;d rather not get ahead of,916.148,1.268
that report and start to make decisions without knowing.,917.416,1.768
"There were observers there, as there routinely are,",919.184,2.269
and I&amp;#39;d rather wait and see.,921.453,1.569
"The Press: And just beyond the irregularities,",923.022,1.434
just the act that Erdogan is going through to try,924.456,3.637
"to accumulate these powers, what does the President make of that?",928.093,1.535
"Mr. Spicer: Again, I&amp;#39;m not going to -- they have a right",929.628,2.469
to elections and their people participate in that.,932.097,3.938
"Before we start getting into their governing system,",936.035,3.403
let this commission get through its work.,939.438,2.803
Steve.,942.241,1.268
"The Press: Sean, when Vice President Pence says,",943.509,2.702
"regarding North Korea, that strategic patience",946.211,1.969
"is over, what does that man exactly?",948.18,1.268
Mr. Spicer: The era of strategic patience,949.448,2.736
was a policy that the Obama administration enacted,952.184,4.171
to basically wait and see.,956.355,2.636
I think we have now understood that that,958.991,2.669
policy is not one that is prudent for the United States.,961.66,3.804
And I think that&amp;#39;s why you&amp;#39;ve seen stepped-up,965.464,1.501
"efforts, particularly with respect to China,",966.965,2.77
and that&amp;#39;s why I think the relationship that the President,969.735,4.871
really is building on from the time that he spent down,974.606,2.603
in Mar-a-Lago with President Xi is hopefully going,977.209,3.27
to produce results.,980.479,0.934
"And so, part of it is to actively engage with world",981.413,4.204
"partners like China, in particular, that have",985.617,2.503
economic and political influence that they can utilize.,988.12,2.736
The Press: What would it take to reach some sort of talks,990.856,2.336
with North Korea?,993.192,1.234
"Mr. Spicer: Well, let&amp;#39;s see -- again, I&amp;#39;m not",994.426,1.468
going to get ahead of the policies right now.,995.894,3.07
I think we&amp;#39;re seeing some active engagement with,998.964,3.67
"China, and that&amp;#39;s helpful.",1002.634,1.202
"So, let&amp;#39;s see how that goes.",1003.836,1.167
Hallie.,1005.003,0.968
The Press: I have two for you on North Korea.,1005.971,1.402
You&amp;#39;re doing it today and you&amp;#39;ve done it before --,1007.373,1.801
you&amp;#39;ve stood at the podium and said you don&amp;#39;t want,1009.174,1.368
to telegraph moves that the President will make,1010.542,1.569
to preserve that element of surprise.,1012.111,2.202
A Kremlin spokesperson said that President Trump,1014.313,1.835
is more impulsive and unpredictable than Kim Jong-un.,1016.148,2.703
At what point does this strategy,1018.851,1.701
of unpredictability become a liability?,1020.552,2.169
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I respectfully would disagree.",1022.721,2.169
"I think that the rest of the world, when he acted",1024.89,2.636
"in Syria, in particular, the world community --",1027.526,3.403
"not just the world community but here at home,",1030.929,2.169
"on a bipartisan basis, applauded the President&amp;#39;s actions.",1033.098,3.203
"The Press: So, you see unpredictability as an asset?",1036.301,1.469
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think -- absolutely.",1037.77,1.201
But it&amp;#39;s not -- I think that you have to look,1038.971,1.902
at the flip.,1040.873,1.167
"I mean, I talked about it a minute ago -- when you look",1042.04,1.369
at some of the actions that we&amp;#39;ve taken,1043.409,1.334
"in the past, Mosul being a good example, where we",1044.743,2.836
leaned in and started to explain what we were going,1047.579,2.069
"to do and when we were going to do it, that takes",1049.648,1.935
a huge element off the table of not only surprise,1051.583,2.636
but achieving the effect that you&amp;#39;re trying to do.,1054.219,2.803
"So, the world community, and especially the more",1057.022,3.337
that he meets with world leaders and developing,1060.359,2.669
"relationships, repairing relationships,",1063.028,2.302
"and reasserting the U.S. place around the globe,",1065.33,3.237
"should be reassuring to not just us here at home,",1068.567,4.438
but around the globe.,1073.005,0.834
People are excited that the President is taking,1073.839,2.336
"action, and decisively so.",1076.175,1.601
The Press: You&amp;#39;ve made it clear that you&amp;#39;re not,1077.776,1.101
"taking options off the table, including military options.",1078.877,2.336
Defense officials have estimated for a long time,1081.213,2.402
that war on the Korean Peninsula would cost,1083.615,1.769
"thousands of lives, it could economically",1085.384,1.568
devastate South Korea.,1086.952,1.301
Is this to be read then as an acceptance of that risk,1088.253,2.736
by the Trump administration?,1090.989,1.335
Mr. Spicer: No.,1092.324,0.934
"Again, I think the point is, is that when you get",1093.258,2.937
into a series of hypotheticals about what,1096.195,1.735
"you will take on or off the table, will we do this",1097.93,2.569
"or not that -- at some point, you really start",1100.499,1.902
to narrow your options.,1102.401,0.867
And I think the President has long held a strategy,1103.268,3.003
"that doing that begins to give the enemy,",1106.271,4.205
"the opponent, whatever it is in any particular case,",1110.476,2.602
"whoever it is, even if it&amp;#39;s just a negotiation,",1113.078,3.67
the options of knowing where to go or where not to go.,1116.748,2.203
"And so, the President has been very clear that not",1118.951,2.168
taking options off the table gives us a stronger hand.,1121.119,2.37
"The Press: So, do you accept the risk of war?",1123.489,1.568
Mr. Spicer: I didn&amp;#39;t -- no.,1125.057,1.001
"Because, again, by what you&amp;#39;re trying to do",1126.058,2.803
is to get us take something off.,1128.861,1.334
"I think at the end of the day, we&amp;#39;ll always act",1130.195,2.336
in America&amp;#39;s best interest to ensure that our national,1132.531,3.67
interests are protected.,1136.201,0.934
"And so, if we were to say that we&amp;#39;re taking",1137.135,2.236
"something off the table in any way, shape or form,",1139.371,2.302
that would limit what we have to do.,1141.673,1.335
We are going to make sure that we do what we have,1143.008,2.202
to do to protect our national interests.,1145.21,1.335
"And obviously, with respect to South Korea,",1146.545,2.736
we&amp;#39;ve been very clear -- the Vice President spoke,1149.281,2.169
very clearly about the need to strengthen,1151.45,3.336
and cement the alliance that we have with South Korea,1154.786,2.77
during his visit.,1157.556,1.068
"The Press: I just want to be clear, because I want",1158.624,1.735
"to flip the coin, right -- which is something you&amp;#39;ve",1160.359,1.701
talked to us about -- if you&amp;#39;re not taking options,1162.06,1.335
"off the table, if you flip it then, that can be read",1163.395,1.802
is you&amp;#39;re accepting the fact that that crisis could escalate.,1165.197,2.502
"Mr. Spicer: No, I think that&amp;#39;s a stretch.",1167.699,1.435
"I think -- that&amp;#39;s the point, I&amp;#39;m not --",1169.134,2.836
"The Press: So, you don&amp;#39;t accept that risk?",1171.97,1.302
"Mr. Spicer: No, it&amp;#39;s not a question of taking",1173.272,1.568
the risk or not taking the risk.,1174.84,1.334
"Again, you can start to go down a very dangerous path",1176.174,2.37
"of &amp;quot;will you use this, will you not use that.&amp;quot;",1178.544,3.203
"The President is very clear, and I think",1181.747,1.401
"everybody who&amp;#39;s been briefed on it, and I think",1183.148,1.735
when you look at the quality of the national,1184.883,1.702
security team that&amp;#39;s surrounding him -- by all,1186.585,3.17
accounts probably the best in our nation&amp;#39;s history,1189.755,2.536
in terms of all across the board -- you know that,1192.291,2.936
the President is getting unbelievably sound and,1195.227,2.269
strategic advice on how to protect our national interests.,1197.496,2.636
Brian.,1200.132,0.867
Mr. Spicer: Last week you dismissed -- I think,1200.999,1.535
it was when Hallie asked a question -- you dismissed,1202.534,1.802
North Korea and said it isn&amp;#39;t a threat if you can&amp;#39;t,1204.336,2.736
go through with it.,1207.072,0.667
"So, what changed?",1207.739,0.868
What&amp;#39;s our goal in North Korea?,1208.607,2.436
What&amp;#39;s the strategy?,1211.043,1.201
And what&amp;#39;s your response to the critics who say that this,1212.244,2.135
is just blue smoke and mirrors to hide,1214.379,1.936
some of the problems on the White House staff that,1216.315,1.968
this is a failing domestic social agenda?,1218.283,2.803
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s anybody in the world,1221.086,3.07
who would not believe that North Korea&amp;#39;s,1224.156,3.737
actions are both provocative and a concern.,1227.893,2.669
"So, the actions that we&amp;#39;re taking are extremely --",1230.562,2.136
The Press: But you said that it was --,1232.698,1.601
Mr. Spicer: -- they&amp;#39;re appropriate and justified.,1234.299,1.035
What we&amp;#39;re doing is working with the world community.,1235.334,2.469
"And as I mentioned multiple times today,",1237.803,2.302
"especially China, which is really acting",1240.105,3.303
in an historic way to ensure that our national interests,1243.408,4.638
and the safety of the Peninsula is protected.,1248.046,1.569
"The Press: So, what about the -- well, the follow-up",1249.615,2.268
there is what about the criticism from people on,1251.883,2.203
the Hill who say you&amp;#39;re just hiding a domestic,1254.086,2.335
agenda that isn&amp;#39;t working?,1256.421,1.368
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t -- I&amp;#39;ve never heard that -- I haven&amp;#39;t,1257.789,2.002
heard that criticism --,1259.791,1.135
"The Press: Actually, I have.",1260.926,1.101
Mr. Spicer: Okay.,1262.027,1.034
"Well, then we travel in different circles.",1263.061,1.835
"Look, I don&amp;#39;t think that there&amp;#39;s anybody",1264.896,2.069
who honestly believes that after seeing the launches,1266.965,4.138
that they&amp;#39;re taking and the work that they&amp;#39;re,1271.103,1.334
"undertaking, that any attempt to protect our",1272.437,3.204
country and our national interests is anything,1275.641,2.302
other than the right and justified thing to do.,1277.943,2.169
Francesca.,1280.112,1.401
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",1281.513,0.934
"This morning in an interview, you referred",1282.447,1.535
to the missile launch as an unsuccessful military attack.,1283.982,3.971
That contradicts what other White House,1287.953,1.702
officials have said.,1289.655,1.401
Mr. Spicer: It was an unsuccessful launch.,1291.056,1.201
"The Press: Okay, so you just misspoke",1292.257,1.869
in the &amp;quot;Fox and Friends&amp;quot; interview?,1294.126,1.535
There&amp;#39;s no specific evidence that this was,1295.661,2.135
some sort of attack?,1297.796,1.034
Mr. Spicer: No.,1298.83,1.001
It was an unsuccessful missile launch.,1299.831,1.235
The Press: Okay.,1301.066,0.934
Thank you.,1302,1.001
Mr. Spicer: You&amp;#39;re welcome.,1303.001,0.968
Glenn.,1303.969,0.934
"The Press: Sean, you talked about the end",1304.903,2.202
of strategic patience -- two questions -- in the,1307.105,1.869
context of attempting to expand China&amp;#39;s role,1308.974,4.237
in pressuring North Korea.,1313.211,1.435
Do you believe China has the power to change North Korea&amp;#39;s,1314.646,5.572
behavior if they choose to do so?,1320.218,2.036
And then a follow-up.,1322.254,1.968
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s a good question.,1324.222,1.368
I think they can definitely try.,1325.59,3.104
There is economic and political points that,1328.694,2.602
they could be pushing.,1331.296,1.935
Whether or not they achieve that outcome,1333.231,1.335
is yet to be seen.,1334.566,1.168
But I think that there&amp;#39;s a lot of influence that they,1335.734,3.203
"could exhibit in both of those areas,",1338.937,1.568
and we&amp;#39;ll have to see.,1340.505,2.57
But it&amp;#39;s clearly the prudent thing for,1343.075,1.568
the President to do to try to build that relationship,1344.643,1.701
with President Xi and see if we could achieve,1346.344,3.571
an outcome that&amp;#39;s in all of our best interests.,1349.915,1.768
The Press: How concerned are you that the uptick in,1351.683,4.738
"the language, the bellicosity, tweets, could",1356.421,4.872
potentially provoke unintentionally military action?,1361.293,4.504
"I mean, is there a concern that a lot of the words",1365.797,2.77
that are being thrown around could have,1368.567,2.035
an unforeseen impact?,1370.602,1.702
"Just explain to me what the President is thinking,",1372.304,2.736
how concerned he is of the risk of an unintentional conflict.,1375.04,3.47
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t think that that&amp;#39;s there.,1378.51,1.668
I think we&amp;#39;re taking all the appropriate,1380.178,2.036
and prudent steps.,1382.214,0.967
Jonathan.,1383.181,0.968
The Press: I&amp;#39;ve got a question on North Korea,1384.149,1.201
"and China, but first to follow up on the tax question.",1385.35,2.136
You&amp;#39;ve been asked about this obviously a thousand times.,1387.486,3.169
You always talk about under audit --,1390.655,2.837
the President is still under audit.,1393.492,1.101
Is it time to say once and for all the President,1394.593,2.302
is never going to release his tax returns?,1396.895,2.936
Mr. Spicer: We&amp;#39;ll have to get back to you on that.,1399.831,2.87
"The Press: I mean, is he -- I mean, really?",1402.701,2.569
Mr. Spicer: Really.,1405.27,1.235
The Press: He may?,1406.505,1.234
"Mr. Spicer: No, I said I&amp;#39;d have to get back to you on that.",1407.739,1.368
I think that he&amp;#39;s still under audit;,1409.107,2.603
the statement still stands.,1411.71,2.536
"The Press: And on North Korea, you said that China",1414.246,4.604
is playing an active role -- you even said,1418.85,1.969
a historic role -- right now in pressuring the North Koreans.,1420.819,3.904
What are they doing?,1424.723,1.468
"Mr. Spicer: Again, I think when you look at the economic",1426.191,2.769
"front -- coal, in particular --",1428.96,2.369
that that is North Korea&amp;#39;s number-one export --,1431.329,3.437
The Press: That the Chinese cut off the coal?,1434.766,1.168
Mr. Spicer: I think that they have taken some very,1435.934,4.371
helpful economic actions and exhibited positive,1440.305,1.935
signs on the diplomatic front as well.,1442.24,2.202
"But again, this is something that is an ongoing conversation",1444.442,2.103
both on the relationship that the President established,1446.545,2.602
with President Xi.,1449.147,1.468
And I think that we&amp;#39;ll -- as the President has noted,1450.615,2.069
"before, we&amp;#39;ll have to see, but it is encouraging,",1452.684,3.303
the signs that China is showing.,1455.987,2.469
The Press: And the President suggested there was,1458.456,1.135
a quid pro quo in terms of not declaring,1459.591,2.536
China a currency manipulator because they,1462.127,2.035
were helping or going to help with North Korea.,1464.162,2.503
"So, if China does not adequately put pressure",1466.665,4.471
"on North Korea, is he going to go back and declare",1471.136,2.469
them a currency manipulator?,1473.605,1.535
Mr. Spicer: There&amp;#39;s a couple things on that.,1475.14,1.001
"Number one, they haven&amp;#39;t been manipulating",1476.141,2.202
their currencies since he&amp;#39;s been in office.,1478.343,1.668
That&amp;#39;s a fact.,1480.011,1.202
"Number two is, I think the President&amp;#39;s tweet said clearly",1481.213,3.236
that to do so at this time would not be prudent.,1484.449,3.036
It&amp;#39;s not a quid pro quo.,1487.485,1.335
It&amp;#39;s just saying that in the middle of them taking,1488.82,2.936
very positive signs to help us address the,1491.756,2.97
"situation in North Korea, that to label them",1494.726,2.369
a currency manipulator I don&amp;#39;t think would be very,1497.095,1.802
"productive in achieving a very, very important",1498.897,4.638
national strategic objective.,1503.535,1.268
"The Press: Sean, on both the taxes and the visitor",1504.803,4.838
"logs, there are now ethics experts on both sides",1509.641,3.47
of the aisle who say this is the least transparent,1513.111,2.402
administration in decades.,1515.513,1.669
How do you respond?,1517.182,1.301
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think that we&amp;#39;ve taken several",1518.483,2.836
steps to allow people access to this White House,1521.319,2.603
in terms of -- in particular the press.,1523.922,2.035
We hold regular pool sprays.,1525.957,2.536
We bring people in.,1528.493,0.667
We release participant lists.,1529.16,1.235
We give press the opportunity to come,1530.395,2.302
"into the room, see everybody who&amp;#39;s there.",1532.697,1.669
You&amp;#39;re part of the discussion.,1534.366,1.568
"So, I would respectfully disagree with that.",1535.934,1.635
Abby.,1537.569,1.134
"The Press: Sean, there&amp;#39;s a new Gallup poll out today",1538.703,2.102
showing that 45 percent of Americans don&amp;#39;t believe,1540.805,3.471
that the President will keep -- only 45 percent,1544.276,2.736
believe he will keep his promises.,1547.012,1.201
That&amp;#39;s down 17 percent since early February.,1548.213,3.27
"Given some of his reversals, especially",1551.483,1.668
"in the last week, does he risk being seen as a",1553.151,2.569
flip-flopper?,1555.72,1.268
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t think so.,1556.988,1.268
"I mentioned it on the currency, on NATO --",1558.256,2.97
we talked about this last week.,1561.226,2.502
The question in my mind is looking at the issue,1563.728,6.207
"and seeing -- and I mentioned NATO, and I think Matt",1569.935,1.234
asked it last week -- where there are certain things --,1571.169,2.469
"and again, on NATO, if you go back to,",1573.638,1.568
"I think it was September 29th of last year, he was",1575.206,3.137
talking very specifically about some of the moves,1578.343,1.935
that he was seeing NATO make in a positive,1580.278,2.236
"direction, and, already at that point, encouraging them.",1582.514,3.403
"In the case of China, they aren&amp;#39;t, since he&amp;#39;s been in",1585.917,2.669
"office, manipulating their currency.",1588.586,1.736
The Treasury did issue a report on Friday that put,1590.322,2.769
them on a watch list with a number of other countries.,1593.091,2.736
"So, I know that it&amp;#39;s easy to just take an issue and",1595.827,3.203
"say, well, he&amp;#39;s not -- make it seem very black and white.",1599.03,3.804
"But on these particular issues, you can see that",1602.834,2.369
there&amp;#39;s movement to the President&amp;#39;s position.,1605.203,1.668
I would argue that he&amp;#39;s achieving a lot of results,1606.871,1.802
on the issues that he talked to the American people about.,1608.673,3.27
I think when you talk about the big issues that,1611.943,1.668
"he promised the American people in terms of immigration,",1613.611,3.971
we see immigration is down 60 percent at the border;,1617.582,2.236
"on jobs, jobs are coming back over and over again,",1619.818,2.736
"you&amp;#39;re seeing companies talk about new job creation here,",1622.554,3.403
new manufacturing here.,1625.957,2.169
The executive orders that he&amp;#39;s signing are all,1628.126,1.902
consistent with the promises that he made,1630.028,1.935
to the American people on the campaign trail.,1631.963,1.702
And I think on issue after issue -- whether it&amp;#39;s,1633.665,2.903
"immigration, job creation, national security --",1636.568,2.469
the President made very clear promises to the American people,1639.037,3.77
"that on -- over and over again, he&amp;#39;s achieving",1642.807,3.237
great success on.,1646.044,1.134
"And so, I would argue that we&amp;#39;re going to continue",1647.178,2.102
to see the President not only keep his word but be,1649.28,2.136
rewarded by the American people on that front.,1651.416,4.271
"The Press: On a separate issue, about the President&amp;#39;s",1655.687,2.135
continued travel to Mar-a-Lago or any other,1657.822,2.937
place where he&amp;#39;s conducting official business.,1660.759,2.836
Does the White House believe that those other,1663.595,3.67
locations should be treated like this building,1667.265,3.003
in the sense that you guys will be transparent about,1670.268,2.002
who he&amp;#39;s meeting with and what kind of official,1672.27,3.604
business he&amp;#39;s conducting while he&amp;#39;s there?,1675.874,2.536
Is that a commitment that you all are willing to make?,1678.41,2.235
Mr. Spicer: I think we&amp;#39;ve been fairly consistent,1680.645,2.536
with reading out who he&amp;#39;s meeting with and what he&amp;#39;s,1683.181,2.135
"done, providing the pool access to his whereabouts",1685.316,5.139
and what he&amp;#39;s doing.,1690.455,1.101
I think we generally do.,1691.556,1.468
"Obviously, the President has time to spend",1693.024,2.369
with family and he makes phone calls.,1695.393,1.902
We generally provide readouts of those phone,1697.295,1.969
"calls with foreign leaders, whether he&amp;#39;s here or in Florida.",1699.264,3.036
"So, I think we&amp;#39;ve done a fairly good job of making",1702.3,2.202
"sure that people know who he&amp;#39;s meeting with,",1704.502,1.635
"who he&amp;#39;s speaking to, and when appropriate, the contents",1706.137,2.937
of those calls.,1709.074,1.267
"The Press: But, Sean, long stretches of time go by",1710.341,2.002
"and we get pool reports from the pooler saying,",1712.343,1.969
we&amp;#39;ve been asking the White House,1714.312,1.135
for information about what the President is doing,1715.447,1.434
and we don&amp;#39;t get that information.,1716.881,1.602
We can&amp;#39;t even get an answer to whether he&amp;#39;s,1718.483,1.602
golfing or not these days.,1720.085,1.434
Mr. Spicer: I understand that there are some days,1721.519,1.435
"you don&amp;#39;t get it as quick as you want, but --",1722.954,1.401
The Press: Some days we never get it.,1724.355,1.202
"Mr. Spicer: Okay, but with all due respect, Julie,",1725.557,0.934
he&amp;#39;s entitled to have moments with his family,1726.491,3.27
and private time.,1729.761,1.134
"So, I think, respectfully, I would disagree.",1730.895,2.77
I think we do a very good job of getting,1733.665,2.402
"you information, of bringing you along to events,",1736.067,4.004
whether he&amp;#39;s here or at a location or even,1740.071,4.972
going out to dinner.,1745.043,1.168
We&amp;#39;ve lived up to that.,1746.211,1.234
I think the President is entitled to have some times,1747.445,3.637
with his family and friends to just catch up.,1751.082,3.804
The Press: But then that&amp;#39;s the difference then,1754.886,1.034
"to what you&amp;#39;re saying to Abby, which is that you",1755.92,1.535
are providing that information.,1757.455,1.435
"Mr. Spicer: No, but what I&amp;#39;m saying is,",1758.89,1.134
her question was about official business.,1760.024,2.169
And when he does have a call and when he does meet,1762.193,1.435
"with advisors, we generally put it out.",1763.628,2.169
"But when he&amp;#39;s meeting internally, in the same",1765.797,2.769
"way that when he&amp;#39;s meeting here with his staff, we",1768.566,2.336
don&amp;#39;t read out every staff meeting that&amp;#39;s going on.,1770.902,2.002
"And so when he&amp;#39;s down, traveling, and he&amp;#39;s having",1772.904,3.27
meetings -- whether it&amp;#39;s on Air Force One or,1776.174,1.601
"wherever -- that&amp;#39;s what his staff does, is they",1777.775,3.871
provide him updates and policy briefings and give,1781.646,2.569
him an opportunity to make key decisions with their,1784.215,3.671
insight into a particular issue.,1787.886,1.868
That&amp;#39;s what all Presidents do.,1789.754,1.668
And I think that I would respectfully suggest that,1791.422,2.203
we have done a really good job of making sure that,1793.625,2.068
the pool in particular is provided information,1795.693,3.504
"in terms of his whereabouts, and then we&amp;#39;ve provided",1799.197,2.035
background briefings on issues that are coming up --,1801.232,1.969
"where we&amp;#39;re going, why we&amp;#39;re going,",1803.201,1.168
what we intend to do.,1804.369,1.334
"So, I get that there&amp;#39;s always going to be this",1805.703,2.102
"back-and-forth, you guys are going to always want more.",1807.805,2.937
And I think that we&amp;#39;ve tried to do what we can,1810.742,1.701
to get you that information.,1812.443,1.268
"Thank you guys, very much.",1813.711,1.235
"We look forward to seeing you in Wisconsin tomorrow,",1814.946,2.603
if you can.,1817.549,0.7
Thank you.,1818.249,1.302
