"Mr. Spicer: Hi, guys.",1.334,1.068
"Well, can&amp;#39;t outdo Gronk, but I brought",2.402,1.268
some special guests today.,3.67,2.235
"As you know, the ambassadors to the U.N. Security Council are",5.905,2.87
"here today visiting, and Ambassador Haley wanted",8.775,4.972
to come by and make sure we have an update as to,13.747,1.701
what they&amp;#39;re talking about -- some of the issues.,15.448,2.036
"When she&amp;#39;s done, she&amp;#39;s got to join a meeting",17.484,1.568
that&amp;#39;s in progress.,19.052,1.435
Secretary Mnuchin has some comments that he&amp;#39;d like to make.,20.487,3.103
We&amp;#39;ll take some questions from him and then resume,23.59,2.169
the briefing.,25.759,0.667
"So, without further ado,",26.426,1.668
"the Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley.",28.094,3.003
"Ambassador Haley: Thank you, Sean.",31.097,1.201
"I will tell you, we have had an exciting day",32.298,1.602
"in D.C., we are hosting the members of the Security Council.",33.9,3.804
"And when you think of that, this is the most",37.704,1.802
"powerful group that decides sanctions, relief,",39.506,4.437
any sort of conflict that comes up.,43.943,2.136
This is the group.,46.079,1.234
"And so, the idea that they were able to come to D.C.",47.313,2.436
is overwhelming for them.,49.749,1.268
They are extremely pleased.,51.017,1.635
We started the morning at the Blair House,52.652,2.035
"with Senators Graham and Cardin, as well as",54.687,3.704
Congressman Smith and Congresswoman Bass.,58.391,2.77
"So, they had a lot of interaction, probably",61.161,1.735
"about an hour and a half, talking about issues from",62.896,2.068
"budget all the way to peacekeeping issues,",64.964,2.102
"as well as conflicts in North Korea and Syria, and then",67.066,3.07
with the problems in Iran.,70.136,1.268
"So, it was a very healthy discussion there.",71.404,1.769
"From there, we came over to the White House,",73.173,2.569
"and the President greeted all of the members, had his picture",75.742,3.403
"taken with them, and then we all sat down for lunch.",79.145,2.536
"And it was an open dialogue, very much",81.681,1.969
of the members wanting to hear from the President,83.65,3.77
"what his plans are, what he was going to continue to do on Syria",87.42,3.604
or not continue to do -- North Korea.,91.024,2.235
All of those issues are certainly at the forefront.,93.259,2.336
And the idea that he would have that dialogue,95.595,2.169
with them is tremendously helpful to me -- whereas,97.764,3.17
"in the Security Council, we need them to really",100.934,3.003
"engage, we need them to now know that we are about action.",103.937,3.703
And I think that what we&amp;#39;ve tried to do in the U.N.,107.64,2.403
is really bring reform -- reform in the way we,110.043,2.135
"spend, reform in the peacekeeping operations,",112.178,3.07
but also reform in the resolutions that are,115.248,2.035
"passed, that what we pass actually means something",117.283,3.137
and that there&amp;#39;s accountability in what we pass.,120.42,2.436
"And so, I think they heard that loud and clear today",122.856,2.435
from the President.,125.291,0.968
I think that they are thrilled with the engagement,126.259,3.203
that they had.,129.462,0.901
And I think it shows that the President is very,130.363,1.702
"engaged on foreign policy, and they see that.",132.065,2.269
The idea that he would sit down and want to talk,134.334,1.701
to them about each of their countries and the Security,136.035,2.603
Council collectively is massive for a President,138.638,2.769
"to be able to do this, and it was certainly helpful",141.407,2.203
for the United States.,143.61,1.268
Now they are in briefings with General McMaster,144.878,3.203
"focusing on North Korea, also focusing on ISIS and",148.081,3.67
engaging on that front.,151.751,1.335
And we&amp;#39;ll continue to have other conversations as well.,153.086,2.803
"But as far as we go, great day for the Security",155.889,3.269
"Council, great day with the President, and",159.158,2.903
certainly more good to come out of this meeting.,162.061,1.836
"So, thank you very much, I&amp;#39;ve got some ambassadors",163.897,1.935
"waiting, and we will talk to you soon.",165.832,3.87
Thank you.,169.702,1.068
"Mr. Spicer: Thank you, Ambassador.",170.77,1.168
"So, without further ado, Secretary of the Treasury",171.938,2.102
Steven Mnuchin.,174.04,3.737
Secretary Mnuchin: Seems like I&amp;#39;m becoming a regular here.,177.777,1.835
It&amp;#39;s nice to see all of you again.,179.612,1.835
"The Press: We have no problem with that, sir.",181.447,2.369
"Secretary Mnuchin: Earlier today, the United States",183.816,1.569
Department of Treasury&amp;#39;s Office of Foreign Asset,185.385,2.736
Control imposed sanctions in response to the April,188.121,3.336
"4th, 2017 sarin attack on innocent civilians",191.457,4.438
by the regime of Syrian dictator Assad.,195.895,3.871
OFAC is sanctioning 271 employees of Syria&amp;#39;s,199.766,4.437
Scientific Studies and Research Center --,204.203,3.571
the Syrian government agency responsible,207.774,2.235
for developing and producing nonconventional weapons,210.009,4.338
and means to deliver them.,214.347,2.069
OFAC has targeted these 271 employees because,216.416,4.037
they have expertise in chemistry and related,220.453,2.402
"fields, or have worked in support of chemical",222.855,2.937
weapons programs since at least 2012.,225.792,4.604
"Today&amp;#39;s action, less than three weeks after the",230.396,3.27
"attack on Khan Sheikhun, is one of the largest",233.666,4.471
ever executed by OFAC.,238.137,2.903
"In a single action, we are more than doubling",241.04,2.303
the number of individuals and entities sanctioned since,243.343,3.169
the start of the Syrian conflict pursuant,246.512,2.57
to Syria-related executive orders.,249.082,3.203
These sweeping sanctions are intended to hold,252.285,2.803
"the Assad regime and those who support it, directly",255.088,3.537
"or indirectly, accountable for their blatant violations",258.625,4.137
of the Chemical Weapons Convention,262.762,2.402
and U.N. Security Council Resolution 2118.,265.164,6.507
The United States is sending a strong message,271.671,2.102
with this action that we will not tolerate the use,273.773,3.237
"of chemical weapons by any actor, and we intend",277.01,3.637
to hold the Assad regime accountable for,280.647,2.635
its unacceptable behavior.,283.282,2.803
"The Treasury Department, together with",286.085,1.802
the Department of State and our international,287.887,2.169
"partners, will continue to relentlessly pursue",290.056,4.271
and shut down the financial networks of any individuals,294.327,4.204
involved with Syria&amp;#39;s production,298.531,2.336
or use of chemical weapons.,300.867,1.768
"I&amp;#39;d also comment that, recently, we had sanctions",302.635,3.003
"on North Korea and Iran, and will also continue",305.638,3.404
to add to and monitor those as appropriate.,309.042,3.903
"And with that, I&amp;#39;d be happy to take a few questions.",312.945,2.87
"The Press: Mr. Secretary, is this the only round",315.815,2.769
of sanctions we can expect against Syria in the wake,318.584,4.438
of that chemical weapons attacks or are,323.022,1.301
you considering more?,324.323,1.369
And are you considering the possibility of,325.692,1.201
sanctions against Russia for not going far enough,326.893,3.37
to try to dissuade Assad?,330.263,1.935
Secretary Mnuchin: We don&amp;#39;t comment on the,332.198,1.835
specifics of sanctions that we are going,334.033,3.47
to do in the future.,337.503,1.402
"But again, what I will tell you is,",338.905,1.868
"these sanctions programs are very important,",340.773,3.07
"they&amp;#39;re very effective, and we will continue to use them",343.843,3.237
to the maximum amount available by law.,347.08,2.235
"The Press: Secretary, on the budget, is the border",349.315,3.237
"wall a deal breaker for the President,",352.552,2.302
even to the point of a government shutdown?,354.854,1.335
Secretary Mnuchin: I&amp;#39;m not going to comment,356.189,1.568
"on the specifics of that, but I will say is, I was in a meeting",357.757,3.437
this morning with Director Mick Mulvaney,361.194,2.235
and other senior people.,363.429,2.369
The President is working hard to keep,365.798,1.635
the government open and addressing various issues.,367.433,4.238
"The Press: Secretary, can you tell us what these",371.671,2.402
sanctions actually do?,374.073,1.502
What is different today than was different,375.575,1.501
yesterday before OFAC moved?,377.076,2.87
"Secretary Mnuchin: Well, the sanctions",379.946,1.168
are enormously important.,381.114,1.301
"So, by identifying 271 additional people,",382.415,4.104
"these sanctions, as you know, will both freeze assets,",386.519,5.472
"if there&amp;#39;s assets here, and prevent",391.991,1.835
"U.S. entities from doing business, as well as these",393.826,3.804
sanctions have enormous impact with all of our,397.63,2.202
partners around the world who also work with us,399.832,3.304
on these issues.,403.136,6.239
"The Press: As you know, the administration",409.375,1.068
is trying to grapple with the Paris Climate Agreement,410.443,2.502
and come to a decision on that.,412.945,1.302
Where do you stand on it?,414.247,1.234
Do you support staying in Paris or coming out?,415.481,2.303
"Secretary Mnuchin: Again, I would just comment that",417.784,1.301
"we&amp;#39;re having discussions on that, and that&amp;#39;s where",419.085,3.07
I&amp;#39;ll go on that.,422.155,6.84
The Press: The President said last week there,428.995,1.868
would be a tax reform proposal Wednesday.,430.863,2.469
Secretary Mnuchin: He did indeed.,433.332,0.534
It&amp;#39;s been widely reported.,433.866,2.169
The Press: I imagine that surprised you a little bit.,436.035,2.836
What can we expect?,438.871,1.702
"Secretary Mnuchin: Let me just first say, I&amp;#39;ve been",440.573,2.636
working with the President for over the last year on,443.209,3.604
his economic plan in regards to creating growth.,446.813,4.537
The President is very determined that we can get,451.35,3.17
to sustained economic growth of 3 percent or higher.,454.52,4.505
"We&amp;#39;re working on tax reform, we&amp;#39;re working",459.025,1.768
"on regulatory reform, we&amp;#39;re looking at job creation,",460.793,4.171
"and this is something that, on the tax side,",464.964,2.836
I&amp;#39;ve been meeting weekly with the House,467.8,3.203
and the Senate on designing things.,471.003,1.936
"And we&amp;#39;ll be coming out, as the President said,",472.939,2.235
with more details on Wednesday.,475.174,2.036
"The Press: Secretary, thank you very much.",477.21,2.902
"Along the lines of tax reform, I know the specifics",480.112,2.737
"of the broad details will be delivered on Wednesday,",482.849,2.869
"but without getting into the specifics, what does",485.718,2.669
the middle class gain if there is a simplification,488.387,3.037
"but also a loss of deductions, whatever they might be.",491.424,3.703
"If we lose the deductions, how does that help",495.127,1.836
the middle class?,496.963,1.301
"Secretary Mnuchin: Well, let me just say, we&amp;#39;ve",498.264,1.134
been clear on what the President&amp;#39;s objectives,499.398,3.204
"are for tax reform, middle income tax cut --",502.602,3.503
a priority of the President&amp;#39;s.,506.105,2.269
Simplification -- the average American should,508.374,3.337
be able to do their taxes on a large postcard.,511.711,3.77
Business tax reform -- we need to make business,515.481,2.636
"taxes competitive, and we expect, with doing that,",518.117,3.771
we will bring back trillions of dollars from offshore.,521.888,5.939
"The Press: Thank you, sir.",527.827,1.935
I guess the question I have is to sort of bounce,529.762,3.203
off of what John was asking about this,532.965,1.402
announcement on Wednesday.,534.367,1.501
It doesn&amp;#39;t sound like we&amp;#39;re going to get,535.868,2.369
the finer details of what this tax reform package will entail.,538.237,4.338
Is it a good idea to start talking about tax reform --,542.575,2.969
something that you say can&amp;#39;t be accomplished,545.544,1.435
by August -- when you don&amp;#39;t have all the details?,546.979,2.336
"Secretary Mnuchin: Well, there will be details",549.315,1.501
that will come out.,550.816,1.168
"And yes, I think it is important that we&amp;#39;re",551.984,1.201
talking about it and we are going to move forward.,553.185,2.303
I&amp;#39;ll just take a couple more.,555.488,1.234
"Right there, yes.",556.722,0.935
The Press: Can I just follow up on what Major,557.657,2.035
was asking you?,559.692,1.368
For those of us who are not completely clear about,561.06,2.536
"the 271 employees, are you suggesting, by looking",563.596,4.171
"at these sanctions, that there are U.S. companies,",567.767,2.569
"or they have holdings in the U.S.,",570.336,2.102
or they would be traveling or doing some sort,572.438,2.035
of business that we&amp;#39;re actually freezing or barring?,574.473,2.603
"Secretary Mnuchin: Again, I can&amp;#39;t comment on the",577.076,2.502
specifics of these sanctions beyond what we release.,579.578,4.271
"But I can assure you that when the U.S. puts out sanctions,",583.849,4.505
"they have impacts both here and throughout the world,",588.354,2.97
and we wouldn&amp;#39;t be doing this if we didn&amp;#39;t think it is impactful;,591.324,2.936
it&amp;#39;s quite impactful.,594.26,1.168
One more.,595.428,0.667
"Back there, yes.",596.095,0.767
"The Press: Mr. Secretary, would you say that",596.862,2.57
simplification of the tax code or cuts would be,599.432,2.302
the first priority?,601.734,0.734
You&amp;#39;ve mentioned both the Coast Guard --,602.468,1.735
Secretary Mnuchin: Both.,604.203,1.135
The Press: -- and closing the gap with growth.,605.338,1.167
But which is the first thing that we&amp;#39;re going,606.505,1.235
to hear about on Wednesday?,607.74,1.168
"Secretary Mnuchin: Again, what I&amp;#39;d say, on the personal side,",608.908,1.601
we&amp;#39;re about a middle-income tax cut and simplification.,610.509,3.604
"On the business side, we&amp;#39;re about making them competitive.",614.113,4.571
This is the last one.,618.684,1.068
Go ahead.,619.752,1.501
The Press: Can you say if the tax plan will,621.253,1.235
be revenue-neutral?,622.488,1.168
"Secretary Mnuchin: Again, what I&amp;#39;ve said before is,",623.656,1.635
the tax plan will pay for itself with economic growth.,625.291,4.071
"Thank you, everybody.",629.362,1.267
Nice to see you.,630.629,3.237
"Mr. Spicer: Thank you, Mr. Secretary",633.866,1.401
and Ambassador Haley.,635.267,3.17
"So, I just want to kind of walk through what",638.437,3.871
"the rest of the day and the week, and then we&amp;#39;ll",642.308,1.668
get to some questions.,643.976,1.402
"As you know, this morning, the President had a call",645.378,2.102
with German Chancellor Merkel who had extended,647.48,2.402
a gracious invitation for the First Daughter,649.882,3.103

A readout of the President&amp;#39;s and Chancellor Merkel&amp;#39;s call,694.16,3.203
should be out already.,697.363,2.235
"Following that call, the President spoke",699.598,1.435
"with Dr. Peggy Whitson, the commander of the",701.033,2.169
International Space Station via video teleconference.,703.202,3.503

her third extended stay aboard the International,709.341,2.636
"Space Station, breaks the record for the most space",711.977,2.803
time of any American astronaut.,714.78,2.436
The President was honored to celebrate this incredible,717.216,2.436
"achievement by Dr. Whitson and the American space program,",719.652,3.303

"Holocaust Memorial Museum opened in 1993, President Trump",773.239,4.17

the Trump administration is committed to stamping,786.352,2.302
out prejudice and anti-Semitism,788.654,2.035
everywhere it is found.,790.689,1.602

"While in Hawaii today, the President will have lunch",810.743,2.602
with U.S. troops at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam,813.345,3.47
and participate in an arrival ceremony at USPACOM before,816.815,4.305
boarding Air Force Two for the ride home to Washington.,821.12,3.57
As we get closer to the President&amp;#39;s 100th day,824.69,2.669
"in office, throughout the week the White House",827.359,2.169
is hosting briefings and events to provide several,829.528,2.503
opportunities for many folks in the press,832.031,2.536
to hear directly from the administration and our,834.567,2.235
"officials on what we&amp;#39;ve achieved in the first 100 days,",836.802,3.003
and what we&amp;#39;re looking to continue,839.805,1.368
"to achieve on days 101, 102, 200, et cetera.",841.173,4.071
"Throughout the week, the President, Cabinet officials,",845.244,2.169
and senior White House staff will be talking about,847.413,2.302
"the President&amp;#39;s agenda on national, local media,",849.715,3.47
and various platforms.,853.185,1.502
"Finally, I want to acknowledge the distressing reports",854.687,2.402
regarding American citizens coming out,857.089,2.302
of the Ukraine and North Korea.,859.391,2.236
"We&amp;#39;re deeply saddened by the death of a paramedic,",861.627,2.536
"a United States citizen, serving",864.163,1.435
in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe --,865.598,3.003
Special Monitoring Mission.,868.601,1.568
"We extend our deepest condolences to his family,",870.169,2.069
"friends, and loved ones, and wish his colleagues",872.238,2.235
who were injured in the blast a quick and speedy recovery.,874.473,3.604
We call on all parties to cooperate with the Special,878.077,2.536
Monitoring Mission to allow it to fully,880.613,2.202
investigate this incident.,882.815,1.568
The tragic death of a staff member only serves,884.383,2.703
"to underline the urgent need for all sides,",887.086,2.469
particularly the Russian-led separatist,889.555,2.002
"forces, to implement their commitments under",891.557,2.069
the Minsk agreements.,893.626,1.601
We&amp;#39;re also aware of reports a United States,895.227,1.935
citizen was detained in North Korea over the weekend.,897.162,3.037
The protection of United States citizens is one,900.199,2.436
of our government&amp;#39;s highest priorities.,902.635,2.936
I would direct any further inquiries on this matter,905.571,1.968
to the State Department.,907.539,1.268
"Also on North Korea, on Wednesday, the White House",908.807,2.236
campus will play host to a briefing for all U.S. --,911.043,4.538
100 U.S. senators on the subject.,915.581,1.501
The briefers will be Secretary Tillerson,917.082,1.802
"and Mattis, Director Coats and General Dunford.",918.884,2.87
This is a Senate briefing convened by,921.754,2.335
"the Majority Leader, not a White House briefing.",924.089,1.835
We are just serving as the location.,925.924,3.003
"For further questions, I&amp;#39;d direct you to the Majority",928.927,1.802
Leader&amp;#39;s office and the office of the four briefers.,930.729,3.304
"With that, I&amp;#39;m glad to take a few questions.",934.033,2.135
"The Press: Talking about the budget, how committed",936.168,5.105
"is -- this was asked earlier, but can you talk",941.273,3.07
about how committed the President is to having,944.343,2.869
the border wall funded this week or having some,947.212,3.337
funding in that spending bill?,950.549,1.735
"And if it is not in there, will he sign it?",952.284,2.77
"Mr. Spicer: Again, those negotiations continue with",955.054,3.003
House and Senate leadership.,958.057,3.136
"Obviously, the money for our military and our",961.193,2.836
border security and wall have been part of that,964.029,2.436
request and that is something that really are,966.465,2.069
the President&amp;#39;s priorities heading in -- with respect,968.534,2.102
to the CR and keeping the government open.,970.636,2.035
I think we feel very confident where we&amp;#39;re,972.671,2.036
"headed, and I&amp;#39;m not going to get ahead of the",974.707,2.535
negotiations that are ongoing.,977.242,1.569
"Director Mulvaney has been very, very deep in those",978.811,3.803
discussions and I expect there to be an,982.614,2.603
announcement soon with what -- but I&amp;#39;m not going,985.217,1.969
to start to take things on and off the table with,987.186,2.002
respect to what the President may or may not do.,989.188,2.002
Phil.,991.19,1.168
"The Press: Yes, Sean, just doubling up on that",992.358,2.535
"question there about the CR debate and the funding,",994.893,4.071
does he specifically expect there to be funding,998.964,2.002
"for the border wall, or would border security",1000.966,2.369
measures be enough to satisfy the President?,1003.335,2.469
And how do you differentiate between the two?,1005.804,2.436
"For example, what could be funded in the CR that",1008.24,3.737
you could say is part of the wall even if it&amp;#39;s not,1011.977,2.469
explicitly funding for the wall?,1014.446,1.201
Mr. Spicer: There&amp;#39;s obviously a lot,1015.647,1.368
of components to that.,1017.015,1.202
"You&amp;#39;ve got fencing and drones, and again,",1018.217,3.236
I don&amp;#39;t want to get ahead of those negotiations.,1021.453,1.769
They are ongoing.,1023.222,2.569
But the President&amp;#39;s priorities have been very,1025.791,1.335
clear from the beginning.,1027.126,3.069
"The Press: Sean, just to follow up -- are we",1030.195,2.403
backing off from the wall?,1032.598,0.667
Are you saying it is on the table?,1033.265,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: No, we&amp;#39;re saying that the President",1034.6,1.434
has made very clear that he&amp;#39;s got two priorities in,1036.034,2.837
"this continuing resolution -- number one,",1038.871,2.969
the increase in funding for the military; and number,1041.84,1.936
"two, for our homeland border security and the wall.",1043.776,3.47
But I&amp;#39;m not going to start to get into -- we are,1047.246,3.136
having a negotiation with House and Senate,1050.382,1.969
"leadership, and to prejudge where it ends up",1052.351,2.302
at this point would be -- would not be prudent.,1054.653,4.071
The Press: Two questions for you.,1058.724,1.301
"On the Syrian economic sanctions, how would",1060.025,2.136
the administration determine how effective they are?,1062.161,2.802
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think there&amp;#39;s going to be",1064.963,2.369
a lot of ways.,1067.332,1.702
But I think first and foremost is to send,1069.034,2.136
a clear signal to make sure that they understand,1071.17,2.235
that we don&amp;#39;t take their actions lightly and that,1073.405,3.303
we want to do everything we can to have stability,1076.708,4.438
in the region.,1081.146,1.101
"So, I think there&amp;#39;s going to be a lot of ways in terms",1082.247,2.069
of their behavior going forward that,1084.316,1.368
we&amp;#39;ll know whether they&amp;#39;re working.,1085.684,1.368
But I think as the President has made clear,1087.052,1.635
"and Secretary Mnuchin just did, I think we have a lot",1088.687,1.735
of tools at our disposal to try to achieve,1090.422,3.003
an outcome that brings stability to that region.,1093.425,2.636
The Press: And my second one on North Korea.,1096.061,1.402
The fact that a third U.S. citizen has been detained,1097.463,3.203
"by the regime in Pyongyang, does this make it more difficult",1100.666,3.303
for the President to negotiate through China to try,1103.969,2.803
to denuclearize North Korea?,1106.772,1.835
Mr. Spicer: No.,1108.607,1.301
"I think China -- and we noted it before,",1109.908,1.502
Ambassador Haley noted it in several interviews this,1111.41,2.335
"morning -- but China has been very, very helpful",1113.745,3.37
in this process and continues to be.,1117.115,1.602
And I think we hope to see a change in behavior.,1118.717,3.237
"But it is a very positive sign, the level of",1121.954,2.769
engagement that China has been -- has enacted.,1124.723,3.771
The Press: Is the Trump administration calling for,1128.494,2.569
the release of this U.S. citizen currently being detained?,1131.063,4.704
"Mr. Spicer: Well, absolutely.",1135.767,1.202
"I mean, we want to make sure that all of our",1136.969,1.668
citizens are protected and returned home.,1138.637,1.568
But the State Department is playing the lead on that.,1140.205,1.902
Eamon.,1142.107,1.268
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1143.375,1.368
You know there&amp;#39;s quite a bit of concern among,1144.743,1.602
Republicans on Capitol Hill about the federal deficit.,1146.345,1.801
"When you roll out the tax plan on Wednesday,",1148.146,1.769
"are you also going to include pay-fors in there, that",1149.915,2.269
is those things that raise revenue as well as those,1152.184,2.235
"things that are tax cuts, so that conservatives can",1154.419,2.603
be confident that this won&amp;#39;t blow a hole in the deficit?,1157.022,1.502
Mr. Spicer: I think we will have further details.,1158.524,2.469
"I&amp;#39;m not going to get ahead of the President&amp;#39;s rollout,",1160.993,2.202
but I&amp;#39;m not going to -- the level of specificity,1163.195,4.504
"in terms of the pay-fors and the cost, we&amp;#39;ll have to see how",1167.699,2.77
comfortable the President is.,1170.469,1.068
Jennifer.,1171.537,1.368
"The Press: Sean, can you tell us if the President",1172.905,1.401
is aware of the American pastor jailed in Turkey?,1174.306,3.437
And did he raise that with President Erdogan,1177.743,2.002
in the call he made to congratulate him?,1179.745,1.301
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to get into the specifics,1181.046,3.203
of the President&amp;#39;s conversation.,1184.249,1.335
"We&amp;#39;re obviously aware of that action, and we&amp;#39;re going",1185.584,3.804
to continue to work through,1189.388,1.568
the State Department on that.,1190.956,1.501
Jordan.,1192.457,1.368
"The Press: Sean, can you explain why President Trump",1193.825,2.403
didn&amp;#39;t use the word &amp;quot;genocide&amp;quot; to refer to the killing,1196.228,3.27
of 1.5 million Armenians in his statement today?,1199.498,3.103
Mr. Spicer: Yes.,1202.601,1.134
The statement that was put out is consistent with,1203.735,1.569
the statements that have been put out for at least several,1205.304,2.769
of the past administrations.,1208.073,1.935
"So, I think if you look back to the language that",1210.008,2.236
"President Obama, President Bush have used,",1212.244,2.869
the language the President used is consistent,1215.113,2.303
with all of that.,1217.416,1.268
Katie,1218.684,1.501
The Press: I have two questions on two different topics.,1220.185,1.969
"First, the border wall, the logistics of that.",1222.154,1.635
Secretary Kelly said he still expects construction,1223.789,2.402
to start this summer.,1226.191,1.602
There are still a few ranchers in Texas and Arizona,1227.793,2.102
who welcome the security but are skeptical of giving up,1229.895,2.903
family-owned land that&amp;#39;s been in their families for generations.,1232.798,2.669
"So, what is the White House message to them directly?",1235.467,2.836
And what -- can you guarantee that,1238.303,2.369
they will be compensated?,1240.672,1.735
Mr. Spicer: We&amp;#39;re going to -- we will do everything,1242.407,2.57
in accordance with the law.,1244.977,1.468
This has been an issue that has gone on several,1246.445,1.902
times as that issue has been raised over the last,1248.347,2.702
several decades -- excuse me -- several years.,1251.049,2.97
"And so, we will do everything in accordance",1254.019,3.503
with the law with respect to the land that&amp;#39;s needed for that.,1257.522,4.038
"But again, the Homeland Security Secretary",1261.56,2.736
understands what&amp;#39;s going to be needed and will,1264.296,2.736
do surveys and the appropriate planning,1267.032,1.902
to make sure that we minimize that to the extent possible.,1268.934,3.704
The Press: And on the next question on a different,1272.638,2.235
topic -- the FBI and Justice Department,1274.873,1.769
last week arrested two doctors in Michigan for allegedly,1276.642,3.903
performing genital mutilation on little,1280.545,2.303
"girls, as young as six years old.",1282.848,1.668
It&amp;#39;s the first case in the United States.,1284.516,2.136
What is the White House reaction to that case?,1286.652,2.335
Mr. Spicer: We&amp;#39;ve talked before about pending,1288.987,2.67
investigations and we don&amp;#39;t comment on any pending,1291.657,2.902
investigations or actions by the Justice Department.,1294.559,3.904
Major.,1298.463,1.402
"The Press: Is 100 days, as the President said",1299.865,1.268
"on Twitter, a ridiculous benchmark, or an important one?",1301.133,3.169
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think obviously in the context",1304.302,2.303
"of an entire administration, there is a lot that I think",1306.605,4.204
we feel very proud of what we&amp;#39;ve gotten done and taken care of.,1310.809,4.338
You look at the immigration piece,1315.147,1.768
"in particular, border crossings way down.",1316.915,2.069
The number of executive orders and pieces,1318.984,2.235
of legislation the President has signed -- I think we,1321.219,1.502
feel very proud of what we&amp;#39;ve been able to,1322.721,1.935
accomplish and fulfill the promises that he&amp;#39;s made,1324.656,2.503
to the American people.,1327.159,0.8
But I think it&amp;#39;s got to be kept in context.,1327.959,2.069
And I think that&amp;#39;s -- there is sort of this,1330.028,2.269
artificial number that gets thrown out.,1332.297,3.103
"So, on --",1335.4,1.201
The Press: What is the context?,1336.601,1.168
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I mean, the context is it&amp;#39;s 100 days,",1337.769,1.268
and four years in your first term and eight years,1339.037,4.672
for two terms -- that I think --,1343.709,2.302
"The Press: As a candidate, Mr. Trump introduced a contract",1346.011,2.636
with the American voter over 100 days --,1348.647,1.068
Mr. Spicer: Right.,1349.715,0.667
"And so, again, I think when you look at",1350.382,1.601
"the number of pieces of legislation,",1351.983,1.702
"the executive orders, business confidence, the U.S.&amp;#39;s role",1353.685,2.903
in the world -- there&amp;#39;s a lot that we feel --,1356.588,4.705
a lot of accomplishments that have occurred.,1361.293,2.235
And we feel very good about what we&amp;#39;ve done,1363.528,1.635
as we head up to this first 100 days.,1365.163,2.303
But I think you&amp;#39;re going to continue to see a lot,1367.466,2.068
"of action, a lot of results going into the",1369.534,1.702
"second 100 days, the third 100 days, all the way through.",1371.236,3.403
The Press: If in that 100 days there is no funding,1374.639,1.969
"-- explicit funding for the wall, and there&amp;#39;s",1376.608,1.768
no healthcare reform or repeal of Obamacare --,1378.376,2.436
"would the President consider that, and would",1380.812,1.902
he invite his supporters to consider that a conspicuous,1382.714,3.103
"failure, based on the promises",1385.817,1.869
he made during the campaign?,1387.686,1.368
Mr. Spicer: I think when you look at the totality,1389.054,1.535
"of what we&amp;#39;ve accomplished on job creation,",1390.589,3.27
"on immigration, on trade, it is unbelievable what",1393.859,6.439
he has been able to do.,1400.298,1.669
And so it&amp;#39;s not -- you can cherry-pick any couple of,1401.967,3.436
"things and say, okay, well, what about this and that.",1405.403,1.702
But I think when you look at it overall in terms,1407.105,2.136
"of the drop-in border crossings, if you look",1409.241,2.636
"at consumer confidence, and the relationships that",1411.877,2.502
"we&amp;#39;ve developed around the globe, and the accomplishments",1414.379,2.603
"this President has had in protecting the country,",1416.982,2.202
in bringing back jobs and starting -- those have been,1419.184,2.669
unbelievably significant.,1421.853,1.335
"And so to minimize that, or to look and pick out",1423.188,3.837
"two or three things -- but I think, look, we&amp;#39;re going",1427.025,2.402
to continue to push for healthcare reform.,1429.427,1.535
We feel very good about the direction that it&amp;#39;s going in.,1430.962,2.403
It&amp;#39;s been very positive.,1433.365,1.334
And I think the construction of a wall,1434.699,2.236
is going to continue to be an area that moves forward.,1436.935,3.203
But all of that stuff is happening just,1440.138,2.136
as the President asked for and committed to doing.,1442.274,3.37
"Some of it has been a little slower, but mostly",1445.644,2.669
because of working through Congress and getting,1448.313,1.869
things done.,1450.182,0.9
But when you think about what he started --,1451.082,2.036
"he&amp;#39;ll move forward on tax reform, healthcare,",1453.118,2.803
"on immigration, on trade -- it&amp;#39;s been a hugely",1455.921,3.169
successful first 100 days.,1459.09,1.702
The Press: And without the President necessarily,1460.792,1.935
"describing it as a failure or not, would he say that",1462.727,2.436
he&amp;#39;s learned something about the process and how,1465.163,2.803
long things take that he perhaps didn&amp;#39;t appreciate,1467.966,2.569
as a candidate?,1470.535,1.135
Maybe he over-promised on the speed with which,1471.67,1.635
he&amp;#39;d achieve these things?,1473.305,1.334
"Mr. Spicer: Look, with all due respect, I think that",1474.639,1.435
when you look at the list of things in each of the,1476.074,2.069
"various areas that he&amp;#39;s been able to do, I think",1478.143,2.736
he&amp;#39;s very pleased --,1480.879,0.934
The Press: I&amp;#39;m talking about some conspicuous campaign,1481.813,2.102
"promises that, at rally after rally, he made and said,",1483.915,2.469
&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t worry it&amp;#39;s going to happen.&amp;quot;,1486.384,1.268
Mr. Spicer: Right.,1487.652,1.135
And I think on healthcare --,1488.787,1.201
"The Press: All I&amp;#39;m asking is, does he have a different",1489.988,1.835
awareness of how difficult those things are than he did,1491.823,1.935
as a candidate?,1493.758,1.368
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sure that there are things that you,1495.126,2.036
"learn on the job, but I think that he is very",1497.162,1.702
proud of what he has set out to do and the progress,1498.864,2.035
that we&amp;#39;ve made.,1500.899,1.168
And I think you&amp;#39;re going to see healthcare,1502.067,1.601
"get done, but it&amp;#39;s going to get done right, and that",1503.668,1.735
in particular is something that we&amp;#39;re continuing to work at.,1505.403,3.804
"We can&amp;#39;t make people vote, but we&amp;#39;ve made significant",1509.207,2.569
progress and moved the legislation forward,1511.776,2.303
and improved it greatly.,1514.079,1.034
And I think that we are going to see progress on that.,1515.113,3.837
Zeke.,1518.95,1.335
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1520.285,1.068
Two questions on two different topics.,1521.353,1.268
"First, to follow up on Jordan, and the other",1522.621,2.569
question is on the budget.,1525.19,1.435
Is the President willing to sign a continuing,1526.625,1.601
resolution that is not deficit-neutral,1528.226,1.535
or deficit-reducing?,1529.761,1.602
For instance --,1531.363,1.334
Mr. Spicer: Sign a continuing resolution?,1532.697,1.202
The Press: Yeah.,1533.899,1.401
Continuing resolutions that would increase the deficit.,1535.3,3.17
Mr. Spicer: I have not seen a score on anything,1538.47,1.334
that&amp;#39;s come out.,1539.804,2.203
And I think we&amp;#39;ll have to wait and see what the final --,1542.007,1.968
The Press: You&amp;#39;re not ruling that,1543.975,3.604
out one way or --,1547.579,1.234
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not -- not at this point.,1548.813,1.635
"The Press: And following up on Jordan&amp;#39;s question,",1550.448,1.735
the President talked a lot about -- he has not been,1552.183,1.702
shy about criticizing his predecessors for some,1553.885,1.502
"of their missteps from both parties, and also hasn&amp;#39;t --",1555.387,1.801
has made a point of often bucking conventions.,1557.188,2.203
So why not take this moment to label,1559.391,1.601
the killing of a million-and-a-half,1560.992,1.535
Armenians a genocide?,1562.527,0.834
"Mr. Spicer: I think, again, as I noted to",1563.361,2.236
"Jordan, the statement that the President put out",1565.597,2.135
is consistent with the last several administrations.,1567.732,2.803
The Press: (Inaudible.),1570.535,1.135
Mr. Spicer: I understand that.,1571.67,1.468
But it is perfectly in keeping with the language,1573.138,2.536
that&amp;#39;s been used over and over again.,1575.674,1.368
John.,1577.042,3.503
The Press: Would you agree with the assessment that,1580.545,3.003
some within the administration have,1583.548,1.869
"that a vote on healthcare this week is very, very unlikely?",1585.417,3.503
Mr. Spicer: I think the vote is going to get,1588.92,2.169
scheduled when Speaker Ryan and Leader McCarthy,1591.089,2.569
and Congressman Scalise determine that they have,1593.658,1.902
the votes and they feel confident.,1595.56,1.835
I think we&amp;#39;ve been very clear -- the President,1597.395,2.202
made it clear on Friday when he was walking back,1599.597,2.136
over from the Treasury Department -- that if it,1601.733,2.002
"happens and we have the votes this week, great;",1603.735,1.735
if it&amp;#39;s next week or the week after.,1605.47,1.668
But I think we want to make sure that we&amp;#39;ve got,1607.138,1.535
the votes and we&amp;#39;re headed in the right direction,1608.673,1.302
before putting some kind of artificial deadline.,1609.975,2.268
The Press: But would you think that this week is unlikely?,1612.243,2.303
Mr. Spicer: I think that whenever the Speaker,1614.546,2.235
and the Leadership over at the House tell us that they feel,1616.781,2.403
"confident that they have the votes,",1619.184,1.334
then we would encourage them to move forward.,1620.518,2.736
I hate to -- I&amp;#39;m not trying to not answer,1623.254,2.269
"the question, but I think that&amp;#39;s the answer.",1625.523,1.535
It comes down to when they feel as though they&amp;#39;ve,1627.058,1.936
got the commitments to push the bill forward.,1628.994,2.335
The Press: But there was a push to try to,1631.329,2.202
get something on the legislative scoreboard,1633.531,2.436
by the 100th day.,1635.967,1.869
Does it look like that now will not happen?,1637.836,1.468
"Mr. Spicer: As I said, we have been very clear from",1639.304,2.769
"here, and I think the President has been very",1642.073,1.335
clear in his comments that our goal is to get it done,1643.408,4.905
"and get it done right, and get it done to make sure",1648.313,1.735
that we have the votes.,1650.048,0.901
I think there have been some -- I&amp;#39;ve read some,1650.949,1.435
background quotes and sources about when it --,1652.384,2.702
but we&amp;#39;ve been very clear publicly about when we want,1655.086,1.969
to get that done.,1657.055,1.234
Kelly.,1658.289,1.268
The Press: The President has been very clear that,1659.557,1.435
"Judge Gorsuch, now Justice Gorsuch, is a big part",1660.992,2.636
of his first 100 days&amp;#39; accomplishments.,1663.628,1.902
"And the White House, in the rollout about the 100 days,",1665.53,2.469
said there would be a dinner with,1667.999,1.335
the President and all the justices of the Supreme Court.,1669.334,2.903
Now that is off the list.,1672.237,1.034
"Is the dinner not happening, or is not",1673.271,2.069
publicly being talked about because it&amp;#39;s wrapped,1675.34,2.002
up in the politics of the White House?,1677.342,2.102
Mr. Spicer: I think we&amp;#39;ve moved some things around,1679.444,1.168
"on the President&amp;#39;s schedule this week,",1680.612,1.501
but we hope to have something at some point.,1682.113,2.102
The Press: Was it unfortunate to sort,1684.215,1.435
of sweep the High Court into the politics of 100 days?,1685.65,2.369
Mr. Spicer: No.,1688.019,1.301
I think having a relationship and meeting,1689.32,3.738
with the Supreme Court at some point would be a,1693.058,1.468
great idea and something that we hope to have,1694.526,2.402
on the schedule some point soon.,1696.928,1.635
Kaitlan.,1698.563,1.168
The Press: Can you explain the President&amp;#39;s change,1699.731,1.668
of thought on DACA?,1701.399,1.568
Mr. Spicer: I think he&amp;#39;s been consistent about two things.,1702.967,5.239
"One, that he has a heart.",1708.206,1.802
He wants to make sure that he does what&amp;#39;s in the interest,1710.008,2.402
of children in particular.,1712.41,2.036
"But secondly, I think the President&amp;#39;s priorities",1714.446,2.469
since he took office have been very clear that,1716.915,2.435
the focus would be on folks who presented a danger,1719.35,2.47
to public safety.,1721.82,1.901
"And that&amp;#39;s what it&amp;#39;s been, and that&amp;#39;s where",1723.721,1.369
it continues to be.,1725.09,1.167
And I think he is someone who understands the issue,1726.257,3.504
and the priorities that need to get laid out,1729.761,1.768
by this country.,1731.529,1.235
"And so, everything that he has done has been",1732.764,1.134
consistent with what he said from the get-go.,1733.898,2.136
The Press: But I understand that he said,1736.034,1.668
"that the criminals would leave first, but last August,",1737.702,3.67
he said that DACA defied federal law and was illegal.,1741.372,3.671
"So, does he still think it&amp;#39;s illegal?",1745.043,1.435
Mr. Spicer: I understand.,1746.478,1.368
And I think that his comments that he made last,1747.846,1.801
"week, that he understands that in a lot of cases",1749.647,2.803
this involves families and small children who have,1752.45,1.935
"been here, and he has a heart, and we&amp;#39;re going to",1754.385,1.602
work through the immigration --,1755.987,2.269
The Press: But does he still think it&amp;#39;s illegal?,1758.256,2.135
Mr. Spicer: I understand.,1760.391,1.135
What I&amp;#39;m trying to do is answer the question.,1761.526,1.668
I think the President wants to make sure,1763.194,1.735
that he addresses the issue of illegal immigration and all,1764.929,1.602
"of its components in terms of visa reform,",1766.531,2.102
"border security, the wall, all of these things,",1768.633,3.971
in a system of priorities.,1772.604,1.434
"And right now, the priority is to make sure that folks",1774.038,2.403
who present a public-safety concern,1776.441,2.002
to the United States and to our citizens are dealt,1778.443,2.102
"with first, and that&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s happened.",1780.545,1.335
"He&amp;#39;s also very pleased that, through his action",1781.88,3.203
and his vision for how he wants to move forward,1785.083,3.937
"on this, sees a huge drop of illegal border crossing.",1789.02,4.771
That is a big accomplishment for this presidency,1793.791,2.703
and is something that we&amp;#39;re obviously very proud of.,1796.494,1.935
"The Press: Border crossing is a big thing,",1798.429,1.102
but amnesty is a big part.,1799.531,1.234
Does he --,1800.765,1.201
Mr. Spicer: I understand that.,1801.966,1.135
I&amp;#39;ve just walked through the question.,1803.101,1.134
Jonathan.,1804.235,1.101
"The Press: Sean, how confident are you that",1805.336,1.535
there will not be a shutdown?,1806.871,1.468
"Can you, from that podium, guarantee that there will",1808.339,1.535
not be a government shutdown?,1809.874,1.302
Mr. Spicer: I can&amp;#39;t guarantee anything.,1811.176,2.402
(Laughter.),1813.578,1.435
The Press: How close can you get to confidence --,1815.013,1.701
Mr. Spicer: But I think that the work that Director Mulvaney,1816.714,2.169
and others have made in these negotiations has been,1818.883,3.904
very positive.,1822.787,1.301
They feel very confident that that won&amp;#39;t happen.,1824.088,1.869
The Press: So he won&amp;#39;t insist that his priorities,1825.957,3.537
"get funded on the border, the wall, or increase security?",1829.494,3.203
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s not what I said.,1832.697,2.469
I said that I think that --,1835.166,1.769
The Press: Is he willing to shut down the government,1836.935,1.234
to accomplish that?,1838.169,1.568
"Mr. Spicer: No, it&amp;#39;s not -- look, they are",1839.737,1.535
currently negotiating.,1841.272,1.101
We feel very confident that they understand,1842.373,2.436
the President&amp;#39;s priorities and that we&amp;#39;ll come,1844.809,1.402
to an agreement by the end of Friday.,1846.211,1.568
"The Press: And on the 100 days, if I could just follow up.",1847.779,2.702
The contract with the American voter that,1850.481,3.104
the President signed included 10 pieces of legislation.,1853.585,2.636
"Right now, he&amp;#39;s 0 for 10, and only one of those",1856.221,2.602
has been introduced.,1858.823,1.402
Mr. Spicer: Right.,1860.225,1.234
And I think we&amp;#39;re going to continue to work with,1861.459,1.602
"Congress -- as he says in that document, I will work",1863.061,1.768
with Congress to achieve these things; we are going,1864.829,2.136
to continue to work with Congress to achieve those.,1866.965,1.701
The Press: But why have nine of them not even,1868.666,1.702
been introduced yet?,1870.368,1.468
Mr. Spicer: I think when you look at what he has,1871.836,1.568
"done in terms of the Supreme Court justice,",1873.404,1.902
"the executive orders, the number of legislation,",1875.306,2.569
there&amp;#39;s a lot that has gotten done.,1877.875,1.335
I don&amp;#39;t think anyone -- I remember very clearly,1879.21,2.669
"the first few weeks and still, to some extent, the comments",1881.879,3.738
that got made about the pace that,1885.617,1.334
we were keeping and we have kept.,1886.951,1.468
The President has been extremely busy.,1888.419,2.002
And I think when you recognize the amount,1890.421,1.802
of issues that he&amp;#39;s tackled and the amount of progress,1892.223,2.636
"that he&amp;#39;s made, it is very significant, and we will",1894.859,4.972
continue to present all that throughout the week.,1899.831,2.469
"But again, as I said to Major, I think you can",1902.3,1.935
look at a few of these areas and nitpick a couple,1904.235,3.17
"of them, but I think, overall, he has signed",1907.405,2.502
"a record number of executive orders, he has rolled back",1909.907,2.77
regulatory reforms --,1912.677,1.368
The Press: But this isn&amp;#39;t nitpicking.,1914.045,1.268
These are 10 pieces of legislation --,1915.313,1.301
"Mr. Spicer: No, I understand that, but --",1916.614,1.201
The Press: -- he promised to take action on in his 100 days.,1917.815,1.135
Mr. Spicer: But I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s any question,1918.95,1.535
that the President has done a significant amount,1920.485,1.668
for the American people on the issues that he has put,1922.153,2.569
forward during the campaign.,1924.722,1.302
"The Press: And just to be clear, you&amp;#39;re not",1926.024,0.934
"describing the wall and healthcare as nitpicking,",1926.958,1.802
are you?,1928.76,2.135
"Mr. Spicer: No, I&amp;#39;m not -- those pieces are not small.",1930.895,4.805
"But I&amp;#39;m saying in terms of overall, what he has",1935.7,2.035
"accomplished, has been unbelievably significant",1937.735,2.102
when you talk about all of the other areas --,1939.837,2.136
"the regulatory relief, the efforts that he&amp;#39;s made",1941.973,2.202
"on immigration, on trade.",1944.175,1.869
All of those issues.,1946.044,1.134
"And again, what I&amp;#39;m trying to say is, when you look",1947.178,2.069
at everything that he&amp;#39;s done and the amount that,1949.247,2.102
"he&amp;#39;s accomplished in these first 100 days, I think",1951.349,2.302
"you can go back and find an area, one or two,",1953.651,2.569
"and say, okay, well, he didn&amp;#39;t do this.",1956.22,2.002
But I think you have to look at it in totality,1958.222,1.402
of what he actually did get done.,1959.624,2.335
Jim.,1961.959,1.369
"The Press: Sean, on the wall, why is there even",1963.328,1.334
a discussion about shutting down the government over,1964.662,1.335
paying for the wall?,1965.997,1.168
Isn&amp;#39;t Mexico supposed to pay for the wall?,1967.165,1.768
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think, Jim, the President has",1968.933,1.335
made very clear that initially we needed,1970.268,1.368
"to get the funding going, and there&amp;#39;s several mechanisms",1971.636,3.437
to make sure that that happens.,1975.073,1.501
That funding piece will happen in due time.,1976.574,1.769
The Press: But that is a promise that the President,1978.343,2.469
made during the campaign time and again --,1980.812,1.835
Mr. Spicer: I understand that.,1982.647,1.535
The Press: -- that Mexico would pay for the wall.,1984.182,1.301
And now we&amp;#39;re having a discussion that the,1985.483,1.168
government might shut down over the wall,1986.651,1.768
and who&amp;#39;s going to pay for it.,1988.419,1.468
Mr. Spicer: Right.,1989.887,1.068
"So, a couple things.",1990.955,1.135
"One, as I pointed out to Jonathan, we feel very",1992.09,1.301
confident the government is not going to shut down.,1993.391,1.535
"Number two is, I think the President has been very",1994.926,1.802
clear in the past about the fact that -- and this,1996.728,3.036
is not a new thing; he talked about this --,1999.764,2.436
that in order to get the ball rolling on border security,2002.2,2.369
"and the wall, that he was going to have to use the",2004.569,2.002
current appropriations process but he would make,2006.571,2.202
sure that that promise would be kept as far,2008.773,2.502
as the payment of it.,2011.275,1.535
The Press: And just a real quick follow-up.,2012.81,1.302
If border crossings are down -- and that&amp;#39;s,2014.112,1.901
a talking point that the White House uses time,2016.013,1.702
and again -- is the wall even necessary?,2017.715,2.069
Mr. Spicer: Absolutely.,2019.784,1.101
The wall does several things.,2020.885,1.802
The Press: How can the border crossings be down,2022.687,1.735
"when the President is saying, well, we&amp;#39;re going",2024.422,1.335
to have all these drugs flowing in if we don&amp;#39;t,2025.757,1.768
have a wall?,2027.525,1.001
Mr. Spicer: Because you can&amp;#39;t -- just because,2028.526,1.168
"you have a couple good months in a year, I think you want",2029.694,2.369
to make sure that you take prudent long-term steps.,2032.063,3.203
"So, the President is going to fulfill it,",2035.266,1.468
"and frankly, it&amp;#39;s a promise that he made",2036.734,1.402
to the American people.,2038.136,1.301
"I think if you are coming in from our southern border,",2039.437,3.136
he has taken a lot of steps so far that has deterred,2042.573,3.27
border crossing.,2045.843,1.168
But this is a permanent step that will extend,2047.011,1.702
beyond his presidency.,2048.713,1.935
"Eight years from now, the next President will have",2050.648,2.77
that wall in place to make sure that it doesn&amp;#39;t continue.,2053.418,4.237
"The Press: So, Mexico is going to pay for it?",2057.655,1.368
Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s right.,2059.023,0.667
Thank you.,2059.69,0.668
Alexis.,2060.358,1.168
"The Press: Sean, this might relate to Jim&amp;#39;s",2061.526,1.668
"question, too, but on Wednesday -- I have two questions.",2063.194,2.903
"On Wednesday, when we see the outline that Secretary Mnuchin",2066.097,3.47
"was just describing, will the President help aim Congress",2069.567,4.071
toward his decision about whether the border,2073.638,2.736
"adjustment tax is the right idea, and also, related to that,",2076.374,4.704
whether the pay-fors for the wall that might be of interest,2081.078,4.605
to lawmakers will become evident as part of the outline,2085.683,3.303
of what he&amp;#39;d like to do in terms of taxes?,2088.986,1.936
Mr. Spicer: Right.,2090.922,1.268
"Well, I don&amp;#39;t mean to evade that, but I think",2092.19,2.369
there&amp;#39;s a reason he chose -- we&amp;#39;re waiting until,2094.559,1.768
Wednesday to have the details that he wants to share out.,2096.327,3.003
"We got a couple days before that happens,",2099.33,3.437
so I&amp;#39;m going to have to ask you to wait 48 hours.,2102.767,3.87
The Press: Can you say whether we will have,2106.637,1.402
a generally better idea?,2108.039,1.935
Will we have a generally better idea of where his thinking is?,2109.974,2.936
Mr. Spicer: I think you will have a better idea,2112.91,1.468
of where the President stands on tax reform and what,2114.378,1.769
he wants to accomplish.,2116.147,1.134
Yes.,2117.281,1.368
John.,2118.649,1.168
"The Press: Wait, wait, I have one follow-up.",2119.817,1.802
"When you were just describing, and Secretary Mnuchin",2121.619,2.135
"was describing, achieving economic growth",2123.754,2.67
"of 3 percent or higher, which is slightly lower",2126.424,3.003
"than what the President talked about in the campaign,",2129.427,2.102
which was a very ambitious goal,2131.529,2.502
"of 4 percent -- I&amp;#39;m just trying to figure out,",2134.031,2.269
what is the timeline for that?,2136.3,1.468
Is the President thinking he would like to achieve,2137.768,2.67
3 percent or higher in his first term because,2140.438,3.236
"of the headwinds that obviously, the United States",2143.674,3.537
is facing abroad?,2147.211,1.235
"I mean, that&amp;#39;s a very ambitious goal still --",2148.446,1.468
3 percent.,2149.914,1.034
"Mr. Spicer: Well, and I think that he has taken",2150.948,1.368
"a lot of steps not just on the tax side, but on the",2152.316,1.869
"regulatory side, as well, that I think are clearly",2154.185,3.437
already paying dividends in terms of what you&amp;#39;re,2157.622,2.636
seeing -- we&amp;#39;ve talked about this before --,2160.258,2.602
manufacturing come back and jobs come back.,2162.86,1.335
And I think there&amp;#39;s going to be a renewed commitment,2164.195,1.368
"of manufacturers, American companies to bring back jobs,",2165.563,3.57
"to grow, to hire, to expand here in the United States.",2169.133,3.67
And so I think that that growth will proceed,2172.803,2.603
"the President&amp;#39;s actions, both on the tax front and on",2175.406,2.302
the regulatory side.,2177.708,1.135
John.,2178.843,1.168
"The Press: Thanks so much, Sean.",2180.011,1.201
"As you know, the first go-around at replacing",2181.212,1.268
Obamacare was not successful.,2182.48,2.269
"Since then, are you any closer to getting 218 votes",2184.749,3.87
in the House to pass or replace the Affordable Care Act?,2188.619,3.771
Mr. Spicer: Yes.,2192.39,1.535
(Laughter.),2193.925,2.802
The Press: Got a number?,2196.727,1.635
"The Press: Yeah, elaborate a little more than &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot;?",2198.362,1.869
"Mr. Spicer: Well, first of all, we only need 216.",2200.231,2.669
You&amp;#39;re making it a little tougher on us right now.,2202.9,2.936
But I do think that we have seen progress with,2205.836,2.002
members in terms of some of the changes that have,2207.838,4.705
been made to make it a stronger bill.,2212.543,3.203
But we&amp;#39;re getting close.,2215.746,1.402
"And as I mentioned at the outset, when I think",2217.148,2.836
the President feels confident that -- or when the leadership,2219.984,4.071
of the House tells him that they feel confident that they have,2224.055,3.003
"the votes, then I&amp;#39;m sure they&amp;#39;ll call a vote.",2227.058,2.002
But that&amp;#39;s up to them to decide.,2229.06,1.968
"The Press: And a separate one, obviously,",2231.028,2.236
"a different topic, and that&amp;#39;s the election",2233.264,3.136
over the weekend in France.,2236.4,2.102
Any comment on the results that came out of France,2238.502,4.004
over the weekend?,2242.506,1.268
Would the President be satisfied with either,2243.774,2.77
"alternative, Macron or Le Pen?",2246.544,2.469
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, obviously, it&amp;#39;s up to",2249.013,1.535
the people of France to decide who their next leader is.,2250.548,2.302
And we respect the decision that they make in May.,2252.85,4.571
"So, let&amp;#39;s -- our job is to work with whomever",2257.421,3.37
the French people choose.,2260.791,2.002
Anita.,2262.793,1.302
The Press: Two questions.,2264.095,1.401
"One, on the budget, the spending plan,",2265.496,1.902
what is the President doing?,2267.398,1.468
I understand Mick Mulvaney and others are doing things.,2268.866,2.169
Is he calling members?,2271.035,1.602
I don&amp;#39;t see anything on his schedule for this week.,2272.637,2.002
Are members coming over?,2274.639,0.967
"Mr. Spicer: As needed, he&amp;#39;ll be involved.",2275.606,2.736
I think the legislative team has been giving him,2278.342,2.503
"updates, and as he needed --",2280.845,3.737
The Press: Has he been calling members?,2284.582,1.068
Mr. Spicer: He&amp;#39;s talked to members.,2285.65,1.401
I just mentioned he&amp;#39;s having dinner tonight,2287.051,1.802
with Senator McCain and Senator Graham.,2288.853,2.169
He&amp;#39;s had lots of discussion with members,2291.022,2.736
at various times.,2293.758,1.001
This is not -- we&amp;#39;re not at a position now where he,2294.759,3.737
"is actively engaging the way he was at,",2298.496,3.003
say the end of healthcare.,2301.499,1.201
"I think as his team tells him that he needs phone calls,",2302.7,3.236
but he is actively monitoring and been given,2305.936,1.869
updates by the senior team that is working with the Hill.,2307.805,2.87
"The Press: When he calls, is he talking about",2310.675,1.134
his priorities?,2311.809,1.134
I would like you to include --,2312.943,1.435
Mr. Spicer: I think his priority have been crystal-clear.,2314.378,1.835
"I mean, remember, starting in the first week of March,",2316.213,2.77
Director Mulvaney engaged with appropriators,2318.983,2.402
on the House side.,2321.385,0.668
And I&amp;#39;m not sure when he started.,2322.053,1.668
"So this has been an ongoing discussion now,",2323.721,1.735
"almost for eight weeks, with the senior team here",2325.456,4.004
and appropriators in the House in particular.,2329.46,2.769
The Press: Okay.,2332.229,1.068
"And then on the second issue, on the 100 days,",2333.297,1.902
someone mentioned the President tweeted,2335.199,2.636
that it was a ridiculous timetable or whatever.,2337.835,2.536
Why is the White House doing so much this week?,2340.371,2.769
You have indicated that all these activities this,2343.14,3.47
"week, from hearing from different people,",2346.61,2.703
are because of the 100 days.,2349.313,1.301
Why do this 100-day push if it&amp;#39;s a ridiculous,2350.614,2.403
amount of time?,2353.017,1.435
Mr. Spicer: I think we&amp;#39;ve gotten a fairly decent,2354.452,1.268
amount of inquiries from you and your colleagues.,2355.72,2.435
"And so, in order to answer those inquiries --",2358.155,2.77
"The Press: So, you&amp;#39;re doing something for us?",2360.925,1.301
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, well, you know, we&amp;#39;re givers.",2362.226,1.368
(Laughter.),2363.594,2.569
But I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s anyone in this room that hasn&amp;#39;t,2366.163,3.07
"lodged a request to say, &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re writing a story on the 100-day",2369.233,4.538
"mark, we&amp;#39;re doing this on the 100-day mark.&amp;quot;",2373.771,2.135
"And so, we want to make sure that we answer your questions",2375.906,3.07
as truthfully as possible and as thoroughly and comprehensively.,2378.976,3.103
"So, we will have to fulfill all of these",2382.079,2.77
requests that are coming in from you and your,2384.849,1.368
"colleagues, but I also think that we are very",2386.217,2.669
"proud, and the President is very proud, of what",2388.886,2.202
he&amp;#39;s been able to accomplish in the first 100 days.,2391.088,2.336
"And as we sprint towards these final 100 days,",2393.424,3.77
there&amp;#39;s two things.,2397.194,1.001
"One, I think because of the inquiries we&amp;#39;ve had,",2398.195,1.435
we want to make sure we take an opportunity,2399.63,1.768
to make sure that people understand how much he&amp;#39;s,2401.398,2.436
"done in all the different areas, but we also want",2403.834,1.802
to start talking about the next 100 days and what,2405.636,2.136
"else is left to be done, and how we&amp;#39;re going",2407.772,1.935
to continue to work hard to get all of that done.,2409.707,3.27
"But there&amp;#39;s a lot that has been accomplished, and I think",2412.977,4.538
it&amp;#39;s appropriate to comment and to share,2417.515,2.902
with the American people all the things that he has done,2420.417,3.404
to fulfill the pledges that he made,2423.821,1.401
to the American people.,2425.222,1.302
"The Press: And just to clarify, are we going",2426.524,1.568
"to hear, prior to the rally on Saturday, are we going",2428.092,2.936
to hear directly from him?,2431.028,1.535
There was some talk of a press conference.,2432.563,1.535
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;ll have further updates,2434.098,1.368
on the schedule going forward.,2435.466,3.437
"The Press: So, there will be one, or maybe not?",2438.903,1.034
Mr. Spicer: Huh?,2439.937,1.068
The Press: The press conference --,2441.005,1.234
Mr. Spicer: We&amp;#39;re working on some scheduling issues,2442.239,2.002
"for the rest of the week, and I&amp;#39;ll make sure I give you",2444.241,1.902
an update as we move forward.,2446.143,1.235
Kristen.,2447.378,1.134
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",2448.512,1.402
"I just want to circle back on healthcare, because at the top",2449.914,2.235
of the President&amp;#39;s listed agenda items for the first 100 days,2452.149,2.67
was repealing and replacing Obamacare.,2454.819,1.668
"So, does the President want to, expect to see,",2456.487,2.903
a vote on healthcare this week?,2459.39,2.102
"Mr. Spicer: Look, he&amp;#39;d love to do it.",2461.492,1.968
If the Speaker and the Majority Leader,2463.46,2.303
"and the Whip come and tell him that they&amp;#39;ve got the votes,",2465.763,3.57
then we&amp;#39;d love to do it.,2469.333,0.868
I think his goal isn&amp;#39;t to fit it into,2470.201,2.802
"a finite timetable, as he mentioned on Friday.",2473.003,2.303
"If it happens this week, that&amp;#39;s great.",2475.306,1.868
"If it happens next week, that&amp;#39;s great too.",2477.174,2.136
"The goal is to get it done, and get it done right.",2479.31,2.636
"And so, we&amp;#39;re not going to jam it through just",2481.946,3.436
for the sake of it.,2485.382,1.035
"The Press: So, he&amp;#39;s concerned about",2486.417,1.401
potentially rushing it through.,2487.818,1.402
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, he --",2489.22,1.134
The Press: I hear what you&amp;#39;re saying is he doesn&amp;#39;t want it,2490.354,1.335
"to happen this week, just to meet that.",2491.689,1.334
Mr. Spicer: Exactly.,2493.023,1.202
The Press: Okay.,2494.225,1.001
Let me ask you about tax reform.,2495.226,1.167
I know you don&amp;#39;t want to get ahead of the announcement,2496.393,0.968
on Wednesday.,2497.361,0.968
Mr. Spicer: Thank you.,2498.329,1.034
The Press: But there&amp;#39;s a sense that it is more,2499.363,1.201
realistic to pursue targeted tax cuts,2500.564,1.935
as opposed to broad tax reform.,2502.499,2.103
"Will we, on Wednesday, see a proposal for targeted tax cuts?",2504.602,3.436
"Mr. Spicer: As you stated in your question, I&amp;#39;ll let",2508.038,3.604
the President and the team speak on Wednesday with,2511.642,2.803
"respect to what they&amp;#39;re going to outline,",2514.445,1.401
but I&amp;#39;m not going to get --,2515.846,1.502
The Press: But does the President think that,2517.348,1.401
it&amp;#39;s realistic to do broad tax reform without having,2518.749,2.569
to repeal or replace Obamacare?,2521.318,1.669
Mr. Spicer: I think that the President said that,2522.987,1.601
he&amp;#39;s going to --,2524.588,1.268
"The Press: Is it possible, mathematically?",2525.856,1.402
Mr. Spicer: There&amp;#39;s a lot of things that are,2527.258,1.134
"possible, but let&amp;#39;s let the President -- he made",2528.392,1.535
"a commitment to get it out on Wednesday, so let&amp;#39;s be",2529.927,3.27
patient and wait until Wednesday.,2533.197,3.203
The Press: And just one more.,2536.4,1.001
Mr. Spicer: Of course.,2537.401,1.401
(Laughter.),2538.802,1.302
The Press: Is there a plan for infrastructure reform,2540.104,1.234
in the works?,2541.338,1.168
Will we get that before --,2542.506,1.368
"Mr. Spicer: That&amp;#39;s another thing that&amp;#39;s on the list, but I think",2543.874,1.468
we seem to have our hands full right now with healthcare,2545.342,3.103
and tax reform.,2548.445,1.335
He&amp;#39;s obviously still committed to seeing,2549.78,1.468
"infrastructure, something he&amp;#39;s talked about a lot in terms",2551.248,1.502
of roads and bridges and rebuilding things.,2552.75,1.735
But let&amp;#39;s get these first two things moving.,2554.485,4.271
But I think you&amp;#39;re going to see a continued commitment,2558.756,2.068
to infrastructure as well.,2560.824,1.435
The Press: It&amp;#39;s one of the things that could,2562.259,1.168
potentially have bipartisan support.,2563.427,1.702
Is there urgency to get infrastructure reform passed?,2565.129,1.835
Mr. Spicer: (Laughter.),2566.964,1.335
"So, either we&amp;#39;re doing too much or we&amp;#39;re not doing enough.",2568.299,1.334
"But I think -- look, he has made it very clear",2569.633,2.403
that that is a priority of his.,2572.036,1.301
"As you point out, it&amp;#39;s something that I think",2573.337,2.97
"both sides of the aisle, of both chambers, probably agree on.",2576.307,4.004
There&amp;#39;s a public-private partnership that could,2580.311,3.269
really benefit our infrastructure in terms,2583.58,2.536
of the financing piece of this.,2586.116,1.635
"We&amp;#39;ll have further details on that moving forward, though.",2587.751,1.936
"Thank you, guys, very much.",2589.687,1.301
I&amp;#39;ll see you tomorrow.,2590.988,0.767
Have a great Monday.,2591.755,2.169
