Mr. Spicer: Good afternoon.,3.169,0.901
I&amp;#39;d like to start off today by having,4.07,2.269
the Secretary of Commerce discuss an action that,6.339,3.07
the Commerce Department took last night with respect,9.409,2.469
to Canadian softwood lumber.,11.878,2.035
It&amp;#39;s an action that talks about what we&amp;#39;re doing,13.913,3.404
to make sure that we&amp;#39;re fighting for our industries,17.317,2.436
here at home.,19.753,0.8
"So, without further ado, I want to bring up",20.553,1.202
Secretary Wilbur Ross.,21.755,2.035
"Secretary Ross: Thank you, Sean.",23.79,2.569
The action we took last night is actually,26.359,2.736
the culmination of a couple of decades,29.095,3.237
of disputes between the United States and Canada.,32.332,4.638
What&amp;#39;s provoked the disputes is the following.,36.97,2.669
"In Canada, the forests are owned by the individual",39.639,4.204
"provinces, and each of the provinces sets a charge",43.843,4.705
for the loggers to use when they&amp;#39;re taking trees down.,48.548,4.104
"In the U.S., it&amp;#39;s all open market, it&amp;#39;s all",52.652,4.972
market-based prices.,57.624,2.669
"So, the provinces subsidize the cutting down",60.293,3.971
of lumber -- the technical term being stumpage --,64.264,2.903
and then that lets them charge a subsidized low price,67.167,5.038
when the product hits the U.S. border.,72.205,4.805
We have determined preliminarily that those,77.01,3.336
"problems, while they vary from one province to",80.346,3.337
"another, in some cases are as high as roughly",83.683,3.504
"25 percent, and on average are around 20 percent.",87.187,5.905
"So, they&amp;#39;re quite material items.",93.092,3.304
"So, the preliminary decision that was put out",96.396,4.237
yesterday imposes those countervailing duties,100.633,6.073
on softwood lumber from Canada.,106.706,3.837
Those duties will be collected starting today,110.543,2.569
"and they will be collected on a retroactive basis,",113.112,4.672
"going back 90 days, because it is 90 days ago",117.784,4.337
that the Canadians were put on notice about this,122.121,3.404
being an inappropriate process.,125.525,3.47
What it amounts to is the following.,128.995,3.504
There is roughly $15 billion worth of softwood,132.499,7.841
"lumber used in houses in this country, and about",140.34,3.27
31.5 percent of that comes from the Canadians.,143.61,5.372
"So, that&amp;#39;s roughly $5 billion a year.",148.982,3.803
A 20 percent tariff on that is essentially,152.785,3.571
a billion dollars a year.,156.356,2.435
And the retrospective 90-day feature adds,158.791,3.838
another $250 million to that on a one-time basis.,162.629,6.573
"Softwood lumber, as I say, is fundamentally used",169.202,5.405
in single-family houses.,174.607,3.437
We do not think that the price of lumber will go,178.044,3.036
"up by anything like the 20 percent, but there may be",181.08,4.405
some small increase in the price of lumber for the house.,185.485,6.973
The Press: Will housing prices be increased,192.458,1.235
in the United States due to that action?,193.693,1.835
"Secretary Ross: Not necessarily, because",195.528,1.635
you&amp;#39;re talking such a small amount.,197.163,2.169
And the biggest part of most home prices in any,199.332,3.704
"event is the land value, not the lumber value.",203.036,3.537
Lumber is a pretty small percentage of the total,206.573,2.602
cost of the house.,209.175,1.468
"The Press: Mr. Secretary, what provoked this?",210.643,2.336
"As you mentioned, this has been a long-running",212.979,2.336
"dispute, subject of conversations between U.S.",215.315,2.235
"and the Canadian governments, the Bush administration",217.55,1.869
and the Obama administration.,219.419,1.434
Is this part of the milk dispute and is this,220.853,1.669
a lever or a bargaining chip with the Canadian,222.522,2.169
government over that dispute that&amp;#39;s going on as well?,224.691,3.136
Secretary Ross: This investigation had been,227.827,2.269
underway before anything came up about milk.,230.096,4.438
"And on a statutory basis, the last day we could have",234.534,3.87
"released the findings would have been today, so",238.404,3.204
the only thing that we did do was accelerate it one day.,241.608,3.303
The Press: If this is not related at all to the milk,244.911,2.736
"dispute, do you see it as factoring in the Canadian",247.647,3.437
judgments about how to respond or how to resolve,251.084,2.235
some of these other trade disputes?,253.319,1.769
"Secretary Ross: Well, everything relates",255.088,1.835
"to everything else when you&amp;#39;re trying to negotiate,",256.923,2.703
so I can&amp;#39;t say there&amp;#39;s no impact.,259.626,2.669
But what we have tried to do was to clear the air,262.295,4.037
and get this dispute out of the way before,266.332,3.07
the big NAFTA talks went on.,269.402,2.803
"That was not possible to achieve, and that&amp;#39;s",272.205,3.437
why we went ahead and released the findings.,275.642,4.704
"The Press: Mr. Secretary, Canada is an extremely",280.346,2.102
close ally and a neighbor.,282.448,2.102
Are you comfortable with how this has worked out in,284.55,2.57
terms of what it means for the overall relationship,287.12,1.935
between our two countries?,289.055,0.867
"Secretary Ross: Well, they are a close ally.",289.922,2.536
They&amp;#39;re an important ally.,292.458,1.335
They&amp;#39;re generally a good neighbor.,293.793,2.102
That doesn&amp;#39;t mean they don&amp;#39;t have to play by the rules.,295.895,2.369
The Press: What do you mean by &amp;quot;generally&amp;quot; a good neighbor?,298.264,1.668
"Secretary Ross: Well, things like this I don&amp;#39;t",299.932,2.903
regard as being a good neighbor -- dumping lumber.,302.835,3.404
And there&amp;#39;s a feeling in the dairy industry that,306.239,3.537
they&amp;#39;re a little bit abrupt in the action,309.776,2.469
that they took the week before.,312.245,3.437
The Press: The Canadian government said that those,315.682,1.935
are unfair tariffs.,317.617,1.301
And each time the case was brought,318.918,1.902
"to an international court, Canada won its case.",320.82,4.037
What do you answer to this?,324.857,0.801
Secretary Ross: I had nothing to do,325.658,1.902
with the prior cases.,327.56,1.335
I&amp;#39;m confident that this case is a good case.,328.895,3.637
"The Press: Going to put tariffs on dairy, too?",332.532,2.536
Secretary Ross: The problem with dairy isn&amp;#39;t,335.068,1.901
that they&amp;#39;re dumping dairy products in the U.S.,336.969,3.738
The problem is the reverse -- they&amp;#39;re prohibiting U.S.,340.707,4.204
dairy producers from selling their products in,344.911,3.103
"Canada, as a practical matter, and we&amp;#39;re looking",348.014,3.97
into whether there are measures we can do,351.984,2.47
to try to correct that.,354.454,1.268
"The Press: Mr. Secretary, have you heard from",355.722,3.203
"anybody in the Canadian government, or has",358.925,1.701
the Prime Minister reached out to President Trump to try,360.626,3.904
to convince you to change your policy or change,364.53,2.269
the approach or work with you in any way?,366.799,2.236
"Secretary Ross: Well, I haven&amp;#39;t heard of anybody",369.035,1.468
trying to ask us to change the approach.,370.503,2.402
You&amp;#39;ve seen the public statements that the,372.905,2.603
Canadians put out.,375.508,1.735
"As far as I know, that is their position.",377.243,2.803
"The Press: Mr. Secretary, I&amp;#39;m curious whether this",380.046,3.37
softwood lumber dispute or the milk dispute points,383.416,3.537
"to the need to revisit, to renegotiate NAFTA sooner",386.953,3.537
rather than later.,390.49,1.434
"Secretary Ross: Well, I think it does, because",391.924,1.702
"if you think about it, if NAFTA were functioning",393.626,2.903
"properly, you wouldn&amp;#39;t having these kinds of very",396.529,3.57
"prickly, very unfortunate developments back-to-back.",400.099,4.405
"So, in that sense it shows that NAFTA has not worked",404.504,3.47
as well as it should.,407.974,1.368
The Press: Milk is not covered by -- this,409.342,2.803
particular dispute is not covered by NAFTA.,412.145,2.102
Secretary Ross: That&amp;#39;s one of the problems.,414.247,1.167
"The Press: Mr. Secretary, in other words, why not",415.414,1.635
try to resolve this in not-so-public fashion?,417.049,3.104
You&amp;#39;re coming in the Briefing Room.,420.153,1.334
You&amp;#39;re obviously trying to flex the muscles of this,421.487,2.636
administration.,424.123,1.335
"What would you say to the layman out there who says,",425.458,2.436
why is President Trump messing with the Canadians now?,427.894,2.435
Secretary Ross: It&amp;#39;s not a question of President Trump,430.329,2.47
messing with the Canadians.,432.799,1.468
We believe the Canadians violated legitimate practice.,434.267,4.037
"And to the degree we&amp;#39;re correcting that, it should",438.304,4.838
"be corrected, just like steel dumping from China",443.142,3.404
or any other trade infraction.,446.546,2.836
"The Press: You&amp;#39;re trying to make a point, publicly.",449.382,2.636
Secretary Ross: We make it publicly all the time.,452.018,2.469
It&amp;#39;s just that there has been so much general,454.487,2.235
public interest engendered by the two things --,456.722,3.671
the dairy and the lumber -- that we thought,460.393,2.636
it was good to clarify.,463.029,1.968
"The Press: Secretary Ross, during the presidential",464.997,1.936
"campaign, people following then-candidate Trump would",466.933,3.67
have assumed his singular focus would be on Mexico,470.603,2.135
in terms of trade.,472.738,1.168
All of a sudden now we&amp;#39;re hearing all these items,473.906,1.869
related to Canada.,475.775,1.368
Can you tell us why the focus seems to have,477.143,2.069
shifted up north?,479.212,1.334
"Secretary Ross: Well, we had no way to know that",480.546,2.77
the Canadian diary people would take the action that,483.316,4.905
they did; nor did we have any way to know that the,488.221,3.97
lumber dispute wouldn&amp;#39;t have been resolved by negotiations.,492.191,3.537
We tried.,495.728,1.135
"It didn&amp;#39;t work, and so we went ahead with",496.863,2.402
the statutory proceeding.,499.265,2.936
The Press: -- any additional trade against Canada?,502.201,2.87
Secretary Ross: I&amp;#39;m sorry?,505.071,1.234
The Press: Is the administration,506.305,1.368
contemplating additional trade actions against,507.673,1.635
Canada at this point?,509.308,1.335
"Secretary Ross: As far as I know, there&amp;#39;s nothing",510.643,2.035
immediate contemplated.,512.678,1.835
"The Press: Secretary Ross, when I talk to trade",514.513,2.77
"experts about this, they say the substance of what",517.283,2.869
"you did is very routine, like this has been done",520.152,2.47
"before, these preliminary countervailing duties.",522.622,4.738
But they said what was really irregular,527.36,1.935
was the way that you communicated it.,529.295,2.002
Is this something that you&amp;#39;re trying to sort,531.297,0.934
of do as a bit of a PR thing to put NAFTA on notice?,532.231,4.738
How should we read your very aggressive statement?,536.969,2.536
"Secretary Ross: Well, it&amp;#39;s not routine -- it&amp;#39;s not",539.505,2.77
routine in that a $1 billion of countervailing,542.275,3.603
duties does not happen every single day.,545.878,2.302
This is a quite large --,548.18,1.368
The Press: It happened in the early 2000s.,549.548,1.302
It&amp;#39;s happened before.,550.85,1.668
It&amp;#39;s not unprecedented.,552.518,1.568
Secretary Ross: No.,554.086,5.239
We made the release the way that we made the release.,559.325,3.136
The Press: But why did you make it that way?,562.461,1.569
Secretary Ross: It seemed appropriate,564.03,1.268
under the circumstances.,565.298,1.067
Yes.,566.365,1.268
"The Press: Mr. Secretary, thank you, sir.",567.633,1.468
"Sir, India and America both were -- America was",569.101,2.136
the largest trading partner of India -- or India,571.237,5.739
was largest trading partner under Prime Minister Modi.,576.976,4.371
And now we have a new administration with a new,581.347,4.004
"TP, and a revisionist administration --",585.351,1.368
same thing in India.,586.719,1.468
Prime Minister has the same thinking.,588.187,1.535
"So, what is the future of the trade between U.S.",589.722,1.435
"and India, sir?",591.157,1.168
"Secretary Ross: Well, the U.S.",592.325,1.501
does not have a free-trade agreement with India,593.826,1.401
"at this point, so the trade relations between the U.S.",595.227,3.904
and India are governed by the WTO rules.,599.131,2.97
There&amp;#39;s nothing in the actions we&amp;#39;ve taken,602.101,2.603
that changes that.,604.704,1.001
"The Press: Mr. Secretary, following up on what Jim",605.705,2.469
"said, though, if housing prices do increase due",608.174,2.769
"to this, what do you tell the average consumer",610.943,2.803
in the United States if the prices are going up?,613.746,2.169
They didn&amp;#39;t bargain for that.,615.915,1.435
"Secretary Ross: Well, I don&amp;#39;t know what they",617.35,1.768
"bargained for, but I&amp;#39;m sure what nobody",619.118,2.269
in the United States bargained for is people dumping product.,621.387,3.537
It&amp;#39;s no different whether you dump steel or aluminum,624.924,4.104
or cars or lumber or anything else.,629.028,3.57
Nobody has -- The Press: You used the term,632.598,1.935
&amp;quot;countervailing duty&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;anti-dumping&amp;quot;,634.533,3.938
"interchangeably, and they&amp;#39;re two different things.",638.471,1.268
Which is it -- dumping or countervailing duties?,639.739,2.235
Secretary Ross: This is countervailing duties.,641.974,2.302
"The Press: Mr. Secretary, do you have a specific",644.276,1.469
timeline for when the President is going to,645.745,1.968
announce his intention to renegotiate NAFTA?,647.713,2.002
And could this move actually complicate his,649.715,2.97
efforts to get a deal?,652.685,1.601
"Secretary Ross: Well, we&amp;#39;ve put the Congress",654.286,1.435
on notice quite a few weeks ago of our intention,655.721,2.536
to renegotiate NAFTA.,658.257,3.203
What&amp;#39;s been stalled is getting the Trade,661.46,4.605
"Promotion Authority, the so-called fast track",666.065,2.736
"authority, approved by the Congress.",668.801,2.603
"Now, Bob Lighthizer, having been confirmed",671.404,4.671
"out of committee today, and hopefully coming to the",676.075,3.87
"Senate for a full vote very shortly, that should",679.945,3.904
cure one of the objections that some of the senators had.,683.849,4.205
"Namely, they were concerned about formerly",688.054,3.203
reopening NAFTA when you have the U.S. Trade Rep,691.257,4.037
being confirmed.,695.294,1.568
"Now, the Catch-22 to that was they were also",696.862,2.503
"slow-walking the confirmation, so it",699.365,2.769
was a little bit of a circular thing.,702.134,2.569
"But in any event, that appears to be in the process",704.703,3.204
of being corrected.,707.907,0.901
The Press: Will this move complicate your efforts,708.808,2.135
to get the deal?,710.943,1.935
Secretary Ross: Everything affects everything else.,712.878,2.469
"But this trade issue over lumber, as has been",715.347,3.771
"pointed out, is not a brand-new issue.",719.118,2.035
It&amp;#39;s been around for quite a while.,721.153,2.67
"The Press: Mr. Secretary, the next upcoming meeting",723.823,7.574
"of the G7 is about a month away, and the U.S. is in the middle",731.397,1.935
of negotiations with -- or talks with China about how to address,733.332,3.403
North Korea.,736.735,1.335
Are you comfortable that the North Korea calculus,738.07,2.836
has not hamstrung your ability to be as direct,740.906,2.803
with China on matters like that?,743.709,1.935
And is the action with Canada meant also to,745.644,4.004
signal to our other Western economic allies,749.648,1.936
"and partners that if they mess with the U.S.,",751.584,2.802
they could face something like this?,754.386,0.901
"Secretary Ross: Well, as to Canada -- as you know,",755.287,3.27
"at the Mar-a-Lago meetings, we agreed",758.557,3.571
"on a kind of 100-day program, and we&amp;#39;re going back",762.128,4.437
and forth with the Chinese over the 100-day program.,766.565,5.072
"So, we shall see what comes from that.",771.637,2.536
"As to the action with lumber or, for that",774.173,2.703
"matter, with dairy with Canada, it really has",776.876,2.636
no bearing on the Chinese relationship at all.,779.512,5.071
The Press: It seems to me that the object,784.583,1.268
of the 25 percent tariff on soft lumber coming out of Canada,785.851,6.173
"is not to raise wood prices, it&amp;#39;s to save and create American",792.024,5.139
forestry jobs and loggers who are losing their jobs right now,797.163,4.504
as a result of the dumping.,801.667,1.768
Has the administration done a study?,803.435,9.577
Do you know how many American jobs are going to be saved by this tariff?,813.012,2.302
"Secretary Ross: Well, it&amp;#39;s quite a lot of board feet of lumber.",815.314,2.502
Lumber sells for about 38 cents per foot.,817.816,4.405
"So, if you take all these large amounts --",822.221,3.77
there&amp;#39;s about 47 billion board feet of lumber consumed,825.991,4.705
in the U.S. market in a given year.,830.696,3.971
And part of the reason I don&amp;#39;t see that there,834.667,2.903
be a huge price differential coming in is this only,837.57,4.537
affects 31.5 percent of that output.,842.107,3.971
The competition among the American producers remains,846.078,3.904
the same.,849.982,1.168
"So, this is not like suddenly house prices",851.15,3.47
are going to go up 10 to 15 percent.,854.62,2.469
That&amp;#39;s silly.,857.089,1.502
The Press: How many new jobs will be created,858.591,9.275
or jobs will be saved as a result of stopping the dumping?,867.866,3.003
"Secretary Ross: I don&amp;#39;t have an exact total,",870.869,2.069
but I can tell you it&amp;#39;s in quite a few states -- so along,872.938,3.203
"the northern perimeter, going all the way down into Louisiana.",876.141,4.672
So this affects quite a number of people and quite,880.813,2.903
a number of businesses.,883.716,2.202
"The Press: Mr. Secretary, you&amp;#39;re getting bipartisan",885.918,1.935
"support, at the very least, for your actions",887.853,1.935
"on softwood lumber, and I expect there will be bipartisan",889.788,2.77
support on whatever action you take on behalf of the dairy,892.558,3.503
industry as well.,896.061,2.002
"I mean, you appear to be laying the groundwork here",898.063,1.969
for your notification to Congress that you would,900.032,2.269
like to renegotiate NAFTA.,902.301,1.501
"Are we correct in reading it that way, that you&amp;#39;re",903.802,1.936
"kind of paving the pathway here, or at least",905.738,2.869
greasing the skids?,908.607,1.602
"Secretary Ross: Well, the President announced",910.209,2.402
a couple of months ago that he wanted renegotiate NAFTA.,912.611,5.039
"And as I say, it&amp;#39;s been stalled in the Congress,",917.65,3.236
because to do it effectively you really,920.886,3.404
need to use the Trade Promotion Authority.,924.29,2.569
"I think you&amp;#39;re aware of the benefit that gives,",926.859,3.403
"which is when it comes to the floor of the vote,",930.262,3.337
it&amp;#39;s an up or down vote; they can&amp;#39;t amend the deal.,933.599,5.605
"So, it makes it much more probable of getting",939.204,3.07
a deal approved.,942.274,1.335
That&amp;#39;s the practical significance of it.,943.609,2.035
"The Press: So, there&amp;#39;s these very public actions",945.644,1.602
that you&amp;#39;re taking in being here in the briefing.,947.246,1.668
Is that sort of paving the way for promoting that authority?,948.914,4.138
"Secretary Ross: Well, we hope to get as soon as possible",953.052,3.637
the Trade Promotion Authority granted.,956.689,2.535
Only Congress can do that.,959.224,1.669
"And so, we&amp;#39;ve been consulting with the staff.",960.893,3.47
I&amp;#39;ve met I don&amp;#39;t know how many times -- quite a lot,964.363,2.669
"of times, both with Ways and Means and with the",967.032,3.003
Senate Finance Committee.,970.035,1.935
"And we hope that with the Lightheizer confirmation,",971.97,3.304
that will remove that impediment.,975.274,3.403
"The Press: Mr. Secretary, on India?",978.677,3.303
A follow-up on Goyal&amp;#39;s question?,981.98,1.535
"Secretary Ross: I&amp;#39;m sorry, I couldn&amp;#39;t hear.",983.515,1.468
The Press: Do you favor a free trade agreement with India?,984.983,1.635
"As you said earlier, there isn&amp;#39;t one between",986.618,2.403
the two countries right now.,989.021,2.803
Do you favor a free trade agreement with India?,991.824,3.036
"Secretary Ross: Oh, any pending trade events with India?",994.86,3.837
Is that the question?,998.697,1.468
The Press: Free trade agreement.,1000.165,1.569
The Press: Free trade.,1001.734,2.535
Secretary Ross: I don&amp;#39;t believe that there have,1004.269,1.769
been any serious discussions with India,1006.038,2.703
"of late on the topic of a free trade agreement,",1008.741,3.503
but there&amp;#39;s no inherent negative attitude,1012.244,4.905
on our part relating to that.,1017.149,2.636
"The Press: Mr. Secretary, you&amp;#39;re going to have",1019.785,3.337
an announcement on Thursday that you&amp;#39;ll do something,1023.122,2.402
similar with aluminum that you did with steel last,1025.524,2.603
week in terms of initiating investigations,1028.127,3.336
into potential aluminum dumping into the country.,1031.463,2.436
Could you talk a little bit about that?,1033.899,2.035
"Secretary Ross: Well, I think the right time",1035.934,1.235
to talk about executive orders is once they&amp;#39;ve been issued.,1037.169,3.303
"The Press: Mr. Secretary, this is a high-profile",1040.472,5.806
"action, in keeping with -- there&amp;#39;s a precedent for",1046.278,2.636
similar action in the past.,1048.914,2.035
Is there a risk that this could provoke retaliation,1050.949,2.603
on the part of the Canadians and we could see,1053.552,1.535
a trade war between the United States and Canada?,1055.087,2.969
"Secretary Ross: Well, I know that that would be",1058.056,1.702
"a stimulatory thing for all your readership, but we",1059.758,3.837
don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s going to happen.,1063.595,1.435
"The Press: So, you think this is isolated, this is",1065.03,1.902
dairy and softwood?,1066.932,1.768
"Secretary Ross: We think so, and we certainly hope so.",1068.7,4.171
And we look forward to constructive discussions,1072.871,2.603
with the Canadians as we get into NAFTA.,1075.474,2.836
The Press: You don&amp;#39;t anticipate any retaliatory,1078.31,1.768
action on the part of Canada?,1080.078,1.969
Secretary Ross: It&amp;#39;s totally Canada&amp;#39;s decision,1082.047,2.002
what they&amp;#39;ll do.,1084.049,1.168
"I&amp;#39;m not aware of anything that we&amp;#39;ve violated,",1085.217,2.202
so I don&amp;#39;t know what it is that they could do that could,1087.419,2.97
be a legitimate action.,1090.389,2.135
The Press: What if we passed a border adjustment tax?,1092.524,2.136
What if that were part of the tax reform package?,1094.66,2.102
"Secretary Ross: Well, as I understand it, there will",1096.762,2.235
be some word on the tax reform package from the,1098.997,2.67
"people who are working on it, so it would be better",1101.667,2.502
to address that question to them.,1104.169,2.303
"The Press: While we have you, Mr. Secretary --",1106.472,1.434
(laughter),1107.906,2.102
"-- of 3 percent GDP growth, is that a fair assessment?",1110.008,4.138
Is that something that is realistic?,1114.146,1.401
Do you believe it&amp;#39;s realistic?,1115.547,1.368
"Secretary Ross: Well, I would hope that the growth",1116.915,1.101
"could, over time, get to be better than that.",1118.016,3.17
"President Obama is the only President in many,",1121.186,3.203
"many, many, many that didn&amp;#39;t have at least one",1124.389,2.67
year of 3 percent growth.,1127.059,2.369
And with all the initiatives that we&amp;#39;re,1129.428,2.035
"doing -- the regulatory reform, the trade reform,",1131.463,3.904
"the tax reform hopefully -- and unleashing energy,",1135.367,4.538
there&amp;#39;s no reason we shouldn&amp;#39;t be able,1139.905,1.768
at least to have that if not beat it.,1141.673,1.769
"The Press: Mr. Secretary, you mentioned cars.",1143.442,3.303
Who is dumping cars to the United States?,1146.745,2.169
Which countries --,1148.914,1.301
"Secretary Ross: No, I just used that as a figure of speech.",1150.215,1.969
"The Press: Mr. Secretary, finally --",1152.184,1.368
The Press: Who&amp;#39;s dumping cars to the United States?,1153.552,1.969
The Press: He said it was a figure of speech.,1155.521,1.835
"Secretary Ross: I just said, it was a figure of speech.",1157.356,1.968
"The Press: Mr. Secretary, what happened between",1159.324,1.602
"the press conference with Prime Minister Trudeau,",1160.926,2.169
when the President said he would only be &amp;quot;tweaking&amp;quot;,1163.095,3.937
"the relationship, and this decision on softwood lumber?",1167.032,1.935
What changed?,1168.967,1.468
"Secretary Ross: Well, first of all, this is",1170.435,1.368
not a presidential decision to do the softwood lumber.,1171.803,3.17
This was a decision that arose from a trade case,1174.973,4.238
that was underway.,1179.211,2.069
"So, it was a normal decision.",1181.28,2.969
"So, I don&amp;#39;t think it has anything to do with the",1184.249,2.503
personal relationship between Mr. Trudeau,1186.752,2.903
and the President.,1189.655,1.434
"The Press: Mr. Secretary, finally, if you",1191.089,1.735
or the President have any faith or trust in WTO?,1192.824,3.17
"Secretary Ross: Well, WTO is a whole different",1195.994,4.838
subject matter.,1200.832,1.669
We do have some questions and some concerns about it.,1202.501,4.471
There will be a WTO meeting coming up,1206.972,2.736
"in the next several weeks, and what will come out of that",1209.708,3.47
will come out of that.,1213.178,0.834
"The Press: Mr. Secretary, thank you.",1214.012,2.937
"In your view, should the U.S.",1216.949,1.434
stay in the Paris climate agreement or withdraw from it?,1218.383,4.071
"Secretary Ross: Well, now you&amp;#39;re really getting",1222.454,1.435
outside my area.,1223.889,1.435
(Laughter.),1225.324,2.102
The Press: You&amp;#39;re a participant in those discussions.,1227.426,2.202
Secretary Ross: It&amp;#39;s really outside my area.,1229.628,5.605
I&amp;#39;m having enough difficulty dealing with,1235.233,2.67
the trade issues rather than poaching on other,1237.903,2.569
people&amp;#39;s territory.,1240.472,1.235
"Yes, miss.",1241.707,2.903
The Press: Are you concerned about the negotiations,1244.61,4.07
of FTA with South Korea?,1248.68,3.57

"of the South Korean arrangement, the so-called KORUS,",1254.519,4.338
"comes up I believe on May 4th or May 5th, something like that.",1258.857,5.372
"So, that would be a logical time to think",1264.229,2.936
through whether there was something to be done or not.,1267.165,3.871
The Press: And do you think softwood lumber,1271.036,1.768
might get Michael Flynn&amp;#39;s name off the front pages?,1272.804,2.303
Secretary Ross: Is Michael Flynn now a trade issue?,1275.107,5.105
I wasn&amp;#39;t aware that he was.,1280.212,1.868
(Laughter.),1282.08,1.535
"Mr. Spicer: Thank you, Mr. Secretary.",1283.615,1.368
"The Press: Mr. Secretary, here&amp;#39;s one more way out",1284.983,1.769

"is Marine Le Pen in France, who is not",1291.623,2.569
"at all for continuing the EU, how would that affect",1294.192,3.103
the relationship with France and the EU?,1297.295,5.239
Secretary Ross: That&amp;#39;s such a hypothetical,1302.534,1.368
question that I find it very difficult --,1303.902,3.871
"The Press: Well, it&amp;#39;s either she or Monsieur Macron.",1307.773,1.701
"Secretary Ross: Well, I think let&amp;#39;s wait for the",1309.474,1.402
French run-off election.,1310.876,1.735
Let&amp;#39;s see who&amp;#39;s elected.,1312.611,2.035
Let&amp;#39;s see what actions they take.,1314.646,2.202
And then we&amp;#39;ll be in a position to make a,1316.848,1.936
reasoned response to the question.,1318.784,2.502
"Mr. Spicer: Thank you, Mr. Secretary.",1321.286,1.668
The Press: Come back any time.,1322.954,3.337
The Press: You&amp;#39;re always welcome.,1326.291,3.771

Mr. Spicer: He is always welcome.,1335.333,1.135
The Press: It was a pleasure.,1336.468,1.201
Secretary Ross: I&amp;#39;m glad you&amp;#39;re out of questions,1337.669,1.135
because I&amp;#39;m out of answers.,1338.804,1.501
(Laughter.),1340.305,1.935
"Mr. Spicer: Now, that the Secretary has exhausted you all.",1342.24,2.069
(Laughter.),1344.309,1.268
"So, up on the screens -- I know we had a little bit",1345.577,2.002
of discussion about this yesterday --,1347.579,1.735
this is the landing page for the content,1349.314,2.736
of the website that we launched late last night,1352.05,3.437
on the President&amp;#39;s busy first 100 days.,1355.487,3.036
I know that many of you have noted the robust pace,1358.523,2.97
that the President has kept during these first,1361.493,1.335
"100 days, so it&amp;#39;s just a glimpse of some of the action",1362.828,3.003
that he&amp;#39;s taken and some of the key priorities,1365.831,2.035
that he made to the American people.,1367.866,1.501
"Despite the historic obstruction by Senate Democrats,",1369.367,2.67
he&amp;#39;s worked with Congress to pass,1372.037,1.702
more legislation in his first 100 days than any,1373.739,1.935
President since Truman.,1375.674,1.501
And these bills deliver on some of his most,1377.175,1.669
significant promises to the American people.,1378.844,2.836
He signed a historic 13 Congressional Review Acts,1381.68,3.637
to clear unnecessary regulations and keep,1385.317,2.436
government out of the way of the American people.,1387.753,2.535
"He&amp;#39;s extended the Veteran&amp;#39;s Choice program,",1390.288,2.503
giving our nation&amp;#39;s heroes the peace of mind they,1392.791,2.169
deserve while this administration continues,1394.96,2.369
to work with Congress to enact comprehensive reform,1397.329,2.836
and modernization at the VA.,1400.165,2.603
He&amp;#39;s refocused NASA&amp;#39;s mission to dream big,1402.768,2.302
"for American space exploration again, and promoted",1405.07,2.903
programs dedicated to encouraging women,1407.973,1.935
to pursue careers in STEM fields.,1409.908,2.102
"All told, he has signed 28 pieces of legislation.",1412.01,3.303
And it&amp;#39;s not just through legislation that the,1415.313,1.602
President has made serious progress on his top priorities.,1416.915,3.07
The President promised to enforce our nation&amp;#39;s borders.,1419.985,2.669
"His Attorney General, Homeland Security,",1422.654,1.935
and their staffs have been working around the clock,1424.589,2.369
to fulfill that promise.,1426.958,1.769
He has directed a halt of federal funding to,1428.727,2.002
jurisdictions that do not comply with federal,1430.729,2.436
immigration laws.,1433.165,1.201
"He has ordered the hiring of 10,000 immigration and",1434.366,2.369
"customs enforcement officers and agents,",1436.735,2.869
"and 5,000 Custom and Border Patrol agents.",1439.604,3.37
And it&amp;#39;s working.,1442.974,1.202
Illegal alien border crossings have plummeted,1444.176,1.968
more than 61 percent since January of this year.,1446.144,3.57
The world is responding to the leadership that the,1449.714,2.169
President is bringing under this -- bringing to Washington.,1451.883,4.305
"In all, during his first 100 days, the President",1456.188,2.035
"has made 68 calls with 38 different world leaders,",1458.223,3.337
and hosted a total of 16 bilateral meetings.,1461.56,2.802
The President has rebuilt America&amp;#39;s standing in the world.,1464.362,2.937
And these meetings and calls have led to real action.,1467.299,3.036
"NATO Secretary General was here a few weeks ago,",1470.335,2.236
and he directly credited the President for his tough talk,1472.571,3.203
"that was fair but tough as a candidate,",1475.774,2.469
"and now as a President, for helping to put pressure on",1478.243,2.603
"the counties -- excuse me, on the countries that are",1480.846,2.102
not contributing their fair share to the Alliance.,1482.948,3.203
"Just last week, Aya Hijazi finally came home after",1486.151,2.769
the President personally addressed her situation,1488.92,2.536
with President el-Sisi.,1491.456,1.535
"And China continues to take positive steps,",1492.991,2.002
both at the U.N. and in other arenas to help us combat,1494.993,3.203
the threat posed by North Korea.,1498.196,1.935
The President has also turned his words into,1500.131,1.969
action here at home.,1502.1,1.735
"For too many years, the hardworking men and women",1503.835,2.236
of this country were poorly served and with,1506.071,3.303
"a government that wasn&amp;#39;t working for them, but itself",1509.374,2.436
and special interests.,1511.81,1.435
As the President said during his inaugural,1513.245,1.768
"speech, those forgotten men and women are not",1515.013,2.769
going to be forgotten by a Trump administration.,1517.782,2.636
"From the moment he took office, the President",1520.418,1.635
has been taking action and putting America back to,1522.053,2.136
work by putting the people back into the government.,1524.189,4.204
Unleashing the American economy by slashing overly,1528.393,2.402
"burdensome and unnecessary federal regulations,",1530.795,3.604
"welcoming union representatives,",1534.399,1.502
top business leaders and small-business owners into,1535.901,2.602
the White House to personally hear directly,1538.503,1.835
from them about the policies that prevent them,1540.338,2.336
from creating and maintaining well-paying jobs.,1542.674,3.136
"He&amp;#39;s reinvigorating our domestic energy sector,",1545.81,2.47
reviving private infrastructure investment,1548.28,1.768
that helps us become more energy independent.,1550.048,2.436
"And today, he&amp;#39;s signing an executive order setting up",1552.484,2.102
a task force that will produce a 180-day review,1554.586,3.603
"of the regulations, policy and legislation that",1558.189,2.937
unnecessarily hinders economic growth,1561.126,2.469
in the agriculture sector.,1563.595,1.868
That task force will be led by our newly sworn-in,1565.463,3.304
"Secretary of Agriculture, former Governor Sonny Perdue.",1568.767,3.003
"Secretary Perdue, who was sworn in earlier this",1571.77,2.736
"morning, along with many other Cabinet members,",1574.506,2.469
will be traveling outside Washington this entire,1576.975,2.436
week to share these tremendous achievements,1579.411,2.202
with the American people.,1581.613,1.668
Small Business Administrator Linda McMahon,1583.281,1.835
"is in Orlando for multiple events, including",1585.116,2.169
a roundtable with Hispanic small business owners.,1587.285,3.003
"Tomorrow, Secretary Carson will be in Columbus, Ohio,",1590.288,2.536
for the fourth stop of his listening tour where he&amp;#39;ll,1592.824,2.803
speak to the Ohio Housing Council and meet,1595.627,1.935
with local leaders and residents of public,1597.562,2.436
housing developments.,1599.998,1.368
"And Secretary Perdue is getting right to work,",1601.366,2.536
"traveling to Kansas City, Missouri, Thursday and",1603.902,2.102
Friday to visit agricultural facilities,1606.004,2.536
and meet with Governor Greitens.,1608.54,2.035
"The President and his extraordinary, qualified",1610.575,1.835
Cabinet have made incredible progress,1612.41,1.802
"in just these first 100 days, but this is just the beginning.",1614.212,3.67
We look forward to even more prosperity as,1617.882,1.936
consumer and CEO confidence continues to,1619.818,2.202
rise in the wake of these pro-growth policies;,1622.02,3.136
an even safer world from destroying ISIS and other,1625.156,2.77
forms of radical Islamic terrorism that threaten,1627.926,2.436
our entire globe; to keeping our smallest,1630.362,2.168

"want to proudly announce that on May 4th,",1643.108,2.402
the President will speak aboard the USS Intrepid,1645.51,2.536

John Roberts.,1677.375,0.868
"The Press: Sean, does the White House believe that",1678.243,2.135
Lieutenant General Michael Flynn broke any laws,1680.378,3.203
in filling out his Standard Form-86 disclosure?,1683.581,4.004
"And furthermore, why is the White House apparently",1687.585,3.103
stonewalling the committee on oversight and government,1690.688,2.837
reform on its request for some,1693.525,2.002
of the documents that should be in the White House&amp;#39;s,1695.527,1.801
possession on Mr. Flynn?,1697.328,1.535
Mr. Spicer: I will correct you on that.,1698.863,2.069
The committee sent a form letter to several,1700.932,3.27
"agencies, including the White House, asking",1704.202,2.102
to find those documents.,1706.304,1.401
The documents in question the Department of Defense,1707.705,2.67
possessed and sent over to them.,1710.375,2.369
The documents that occurred before he worked,1712.744,1.868
here would be up to him to turn over.,1714.612,1.635
"So, my understanding is the committee has",1716.247,1.735
the documents that they were looking for.,1717.982,1.969
"The Press: Well, in the letter that Marc Short --",1719.951,2.269
"and I know that SF-86 was referred to the DIA,",1722.22,2.502
and apparently --,1724.722,1.102
Mr. Spicer: It wasn&amp;#39;t just referred to them.,1725.824,1.101
That&amp;#39;s where it --,1726.925,1.034
"The Press: Well, I know -- but they were referred",1727.959,1.168
"to the DIA for the SF-86, and apparently they have",1729.127,1.835
gained access to that document.,1730.962,1.435
But there were other documents that should,1732.397,1.301
"be in the White House&amp;#39;s possession that Marc Short,",1733.698,2.102
"in the letter to the committee,",1735.8,0.901
said the White House can&amp;#39;t provide because,1736.701,2.569
of its sensitive nature.,1739.27,1.235
It also said that there were no documents,1740.505,2.035
that were available prior to the 20th.,1742.54,2.703
Mr. Spicer: Right.,1745.243,1.168
"The Press: But I also ask the question, does the",1746.411,1.134
White House believe that Lieutenant General Flynn,1747.545,3.504
might have broken the law when he filled out the SF-86?,1751.049,2.502
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t -- that would be a question,1753.551,2.036
for him and a law enforcement agency whether,1755.587,2.669
or not he filled -- I don&amp;#39;t know what he filled,1758.256,1.535
out and what he did or did not do.,1759.791,1.568
That all happened -- he filled that form out prior,1761.359,2.436
"to coming here, and so it would be up to the",1763.795,1.868
committee and other authorities to look at that.,1765.663,1.902
I don&amp;#39;t know.,1767.565,0.935
"But with respect to the letter, they asked for",1768.5,1.101
"three things -- the SF-86, which you properly",1769.601,2.636
point out was in the possession of the DIA.,1772.237,2.269
My understanding through reports is that they have,1774.506,2.769
"obtained that, then they ask for documents prior",1777.275,2.836
to January 20th.,1780.111,0.868
"As you know through the Constitution, we didn&amp;#39;t",1780.979,2.435
assume the White House until January 20th,1783.414,3.537
"at noon, so we don&amp;#39;t have the documents prior",1786.951,1.802
to assuming the White House.,1788.753,1.535
And then the third would be they listed for every,1790.288,3.437
"call and contact made, which is an extraordinary",1793.725,3.437
number that -- that&amp;#39;s a very unwieldy request.,1797.162,5.438
"The Press: So, was it the sheer volume of it, or --",1802.6,1.769
"Mr. Spicer: Well, to say we want the National",1804.369,2.002
"Security Advisor, whose job it is to talk with",1806.371,2.569
"foreign counterparts on a daily basis, to document",1808.94,2.269
every call that he may or may not have made is not,1811.209,2.135
exactly a request that will be filled.,1813.344,1.869
But every document that they asked for my,1815.213,1.835
understanding is that they&amp;#39;ve gotten.,1817.048,1.602
"The Press: Sean, is it your position that during",1818.65,1.968
"the transition, the Trump transition has no",1820.618,5.239
custodial possession of any of these documents,1825.857,2.903
that Flynn filled out as part of a process,1828.76,5.772
to become the President&amp;#39;s National Security Advisor?,1834.532,2.269
"I mean, what you seem to be suggesting is an arms&amp;#39;",1836.801,2.269
length relationship.,1839.07,0.734
Mr. Spicer: There&amp;#39;s two issues.,1839.804,3.003
"He had an SF86, which is a security clearance form",1842.807,2.302
that was filled out during the Obama administration.,1845.109,2.536
He had a reinvestigation in 2016.,1847.645,3.103
That was done under the last administration.,1850.748,1.936
"And again, those are not documents that the White",1852.684,4.104
House would ever possess on any employee.,1856.788,1.735
They would come from the requesting authority.,1858.523,2.969
"The Press: Okay, so --",1861.492,1.569
"Mr. Spicer: So, in that case -- again, remember, they sent out",1863.061,2.068
a form letter to I think five or six agencies requesting,1865.129,3.037
the same documents.,1868.166,1.201
The place for the documents that they,1869.367,2.903
had questioned did fulfill that request.,1872.27,2.235
The Press: Right.,1874.505,1.035
"I&amp;#39;m just trying to find out from your perspective,",1875.54,1.268
is there no obligation either from the transition,1876.808,2.269
or the White House to do anything more than you,1879.077,2.469
have done or has been done in this matter?,1881.546,1.968
Mr. Spicer: Everything that the White House has,1883.514,2.169
been asked to do we have -- the only documents that,1885.683,3.837
were made available to them that they asked for,1889.52,2.903
were the ones that the Department of Defense had.,1892.423,1.569
The Press: How about these calls made when he was,1893.992,1.968
working during the transition on behalf,1895.96,2.036
of a future President Trump?,1897.996,1.568
Aren&amp;#39;t those things that you should have,1899.564,1.501
some either responsibility or obligation to provide,1901.065,2.403
if you can?,1903.468,1.168
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think again, it&amp;#39;s a question",1904.636,1.101
of if you can.,1905.737,1.167
When you ask for every call --,1906.904,1.402
The Press: -- that you can --,1908.306,1.101
"Mr. Spicer: No, but I think that&amp;#39;s a pretty -- there is --",1909.407,4.238
to ask for every call or contact,1913.645,1.935
that the a National Security Advisor made is pretty,1915.58,4.638
"outlandish, if you will -- to say that we want to have a list",1920.218,2.736
of every -- there is no --,1922.954,4.037
The Press: Those calls were made on behalf,1926.991,1.669
"of the Trump transition, were they not?",1928.66,1.801
Mr. Spicer: When?,1930.461,1.235
The Press: When he was in the -- I mean --,1931.696,1.969
Mr. Spicer: He did not -- we started,1933.665,2.402
this administration on January 20th.,1936.067,2.069
All the information that they are talking about,1938.136,1.935
occurred prior to him being at the White House.,1940.071,2.135
"The Press: Yes, but he was working for the transition.",1942.206,2.069
"And I&amp;#39;m saying, is there any obligation you have --",1944.275,2.069
Mr. Spicer: Not at the White House.,1946.344,1.601
Everything that is being questioned occurred prior,1947.945,3.137
to January 20th.,1951.082,1.034
The Press: -- the delivery of those documents?,1952.116,2.503
The Press: But you&amp;#39;re acting as if you had,1954.619,2.002
no custodial responsibility of your own transition.,1956.621,3.136
That&amp;#39;s all I&amp;#39;m trying to --,1959.757,1.168
"Mr. Spicer: And I guess the question is, is that what --",1960.925,1.668
The Press: He wasn&amp;#39;t making calls as a private citizen.,1962.593,1.502
He was making them as a future National Security Advisor.,1964.095,1.768
Mr. Spicer: I understand that.,1965.863,0.968
"And right now, to ask the White House for these",1966.831,1.969
documents that were not in possession of the White House,1968.8,3.003
is ridiculous.,1971.803,3.937
John.,1975.74,1.902
"The Press: Two weeks ago, when General Flynn&amp;#39;s",1977.642,1.668
attorney wrote to the Senate Intelligence Committee,1979.31,3.37
suggesting some sort of immunity deal,1982.68,3.003
"for General Flynn, I asked you a question about whether",1985.683,3.937
the White House would be invoking executive,1989.62,1.936
"privilege, and your response at that time was,",1991.556,2.669
"no, we have no problem with General Flynn",1994.225,1.869
"testifying, he&amp;#39;s free to do so, we won&amp;#39;t be",1996.094,3.036
invoking any type of privilege.,1999.13,1.501
Does that also apply to any documents that,2000.631,5.539
the White House may have related to General Flynn&amp;#39;s,2006.17,3.003
"service, the short service as the National Security Advisor",2009.173,1.969
"to the President, and the time in which",2011.142,1.802
he served in the transition period as an advisor,2012.944,5.305
to the President-elect?,2018.249,2.002
"Mr. Spicer: I think, look, when you asked -- I know",2020.251,2.269
that when Chaffetz was asked whether or not what,2022.52,5.739
"he is looking into here at the White House, my",2028.259,2.035
understanding is he was very clear that had,2030.294,1.569
to do with his time prior to that.,2031.863,1.334
So talking about what his role was at the White House,2033.197,2.369
seems not germane to any of the questions that are being asked.,2035.566,2.469
The Press: What about prior to his service,2038.035,1.902
at the White House?,2039.937,1.202
"Mr. Spicer: For that, again, it would have",2041.139,1.234
to go to General Flynn.,2042.373,1.201
There&amp;#39;s nothing that is being asked for with,2043.574,1.535
respect to his service here at the White House.,2045.109,2.102
The documents that Major was referring to rest within,2047.211,2.736
the Department of Defense.,2049.947,0.835
My understanding is that they were provided.,2050.782,2.802
"The Press: And the overall issue of privilege, would",2053.584,2.436
you be open to --,2056.02,1.368
"Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not at this time -- to answer that question,",2057.388,3.203
I don&amp;#39;t know the answer.,2060.591,0.801
There&amp;#39;s nothing that I&amp;#39;m responding to on that,2061.392,3.537
particular matter.,2064.929,1.034
"The Press: Sean, generally speaking, within",2065.963,11.979
"the Trump administration, how important is it for",2077.942,1.869
the President that everyone working for this administration,2079.811,1.635
is honest on their security clearance forms?,2081.446,1.101
Mr. Spicer: Very.,2082.547,1.401
"And so -- and if they don&amp;#39;t, then they&amp;#39;re going",2083.948,1.201
to be investigated.,2085.149,1.402
"But you assume -- look, everybody fills out forms",2086.551,1.334
all the time.,2087.885,1.235
All of us in some point we sign our name and swear,2089.12,1.702
under oath that everything is in there.,2090.822,1.334
So I think each and every one of us in different,2092.156,2.603
ways signs our names and agrees to abide,2094.759,2.235
by the information that we provide.,2096.994,1.769
The Press: Do you know if the President is aware of,2098.763,2.903
the comments that were made by the House Oversight,2101.666,2.369
Chairman today?,2104.035,1.268
And does he agree at all with the assertion that,2105.303,3.103
it seems as though General Flynn was not in compliance,2108.406,3.637
with the law?,2112.043,1.201
"Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not -- and again, that&amp;#39;s not -- that",2113.244,1.868
"would be a matter for them to look into, not for us.",2115.112,2.169
Kaitlin.,2117.281,1.268
The Press: Does the White House consider Mike,2118.549,1.168
Flynn&amp;#39;s payment from Russia today to be,2119.717,2.669
a payment from a foreign government?,2122.386,1.669
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know.,2124.055,1.334
"That was -- again, all of that occurred prior",2125.389,1.335
to his service --,2126.724,1.502
"The Press: Your White House, does this White House consider",2128.226,2.535
a payment from Russia today to be a payment,2130.761,1.702
from a foreign government?,2132.463,1.335
"Mr. Spicer: I understand, but what I&amp;#39;m saying",2133.798,1.401
is everything that he did was prior to coming,2135.199,1.402
to this White House.,2136.601,1.101
"So, for us to determine someone else&amp;#39;s thing as",2137.702,2.035
a consultant --,2139.737,9.243
"The Press: If it was to happen today, do you consider",2148.98,1.301
that to be a payment from a foreign government?,2150.281,0.567
"Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sorry, if what?",2150.848,2.269
The Press: If someone took money from Russia today -- today --,2153.117,1.068
Mr. Spicer: If they were,2154.185,1.101
"an employee of the White House, absolutely.",2155.286,1.568
"But, I mean, again, I don&amp;#39;t know the exact circumstances.",2156.854,1.735
Everything that&amp;#39;s being discussed occurred prior,2158.589,1.435
"to his employment at the White House,",2160.024,1.268
occurred as a consultant.,2161.292,1.435
"So whatever he did, as long as he did it in",2162.727,1.568
"compliance with the law, as every one of us as",2164.295,1.301
a citizen has the right to do -- that&amp;#39;s up to an,2165.596,1.368
individual to do -- and then comply with the law.,2166.964,1.268
"The Press: To follow up on that, why didn&amp;#39;t he --",2168.232,1.468
why wasn&amp;#39;t he more closely vetted during,2169.7,1.669
the transition period?,2171.369,1.535
"Mr. Spicer: Well, again, you fill out forms and --",2172.904,2.102
The Press: -- the White House and the Trump transition team,2175.006,1.768
should have known about this,2176.774,2.136
before they were having him come to the White House.,2178.91,1.401
"Mr. Spicer: Well, again, you fill out the forms,",2180.311,1.468
"you do an investigation, and you do a background check.",2181.779,1.869
"Every employee gets that background check done,",2183.648,2.235
and they have a security clearance and they fill,2185.883,1.568
"it out, and that&amp;#39;s how -- everyone operates",2187.451,2.103
under the same guise.,2189.554,0.967
"The Press: I have two questions, but I want",2190.521,2.336
to follow up on that.,2192.857,0.767
"So, you&amp;#39;re saying that it&amp;#39;s a problem with",2193.624,1.302
"the process of vetting -- the vetting process, and not --",2194.926,3.103
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not saying it&amp;#39;s a problem,2198.029,2.102
with the vetting.,2200.131,5.505
I&amp;#39;m saying that every single person who comes,2205.636,1.201
to work in here at a certain level is required to fill,2206.837,1.635
"out the same form, an SF-86.",2208.472,1.302
And that background check is adjudicated.,2209.774,1.401
"You rely on that person when they sign their name,",2211.175,1.635
and then investigators pick it up.,2212.81,1.201
"But there&amp;#39;s always going to be, in the case",2214.011,1.368
"of people who had a prior clearance, that between",2215.379,2.636
the time that they filled it out and had,2218.015,1.335
it adjudicated they could have engaged in something.,2219.35,2.236
And whether or not they updated that or not is,2221.586,2.569
always the onus is on the individual.,2224.155,1.701
The Press: I do want to ask you really quickly,2225.856,1.969
about the wall.,2227.825,1.168
"Yesterday, President Trump reportedly said that he&amp;#39;s",2228.993,3.17
going to delay pushing the wall through.,2232.163,2.969
"And so, can you just clarify what the status",2235.132,3.003
"of that is -- what&amp;#39;s happening, when?",2238.135,2.436
Mr. Spicer: The President made it very clear --,2240.571,2.403
I think he tweeted about this earlier --,2242.974,1.334
his priorities have not changed.,2244.308,1.402
There will be a wall built.,2245.71,1.434
"It&amp;#39;s important to prevent human trafficking,",2247.144,2.269
"gangs like MS-13 from coming into the country, the flow",2249.413,2.736
"of illegal drugs, illegal immigration.",2252.149,2.403
There is a national economic and safety issue,2254.552,2.869

"safety, and there&amp;#39;s plenty of planning",2259.49,2.336
that can be done in FY17.,2261.826,1.501

"going into FY17, the remainder of budgeting for that.",2265.663,5.205
"And we&amp;#39;ll continue to ask for more in FY18. The Press: So, it&amp;#39;s delayed for now?",2270.868,1.001
"Mr. Spicer: No, no.",2271.869,1.068
I never -- no one said delayed.,2272.937,1.702

"as the President laid out, for both border security",2283.381,2.269
"and homeland security and national defense,",2285.65,2.102
as we&amp;#39;ve always maintained.,2287.752,1.067
"And then when we come to FY18, that starts",2288.819,1.969
"at the beginning of October, the end of September,",2290.788,4.438
and that next budget will go for the next group of money.,2295.226,2.169
"The Press: So, use that partial funding --",2297.395,1.434
Mr. Spicer: We&amp;#39;ve made our priorities very clear,2298.829,2.87
"as we continue to negotiate, and I think nothing",2301.699,2.97
has changed on the President&amp;#39;s priorities.,2304.669,1.935
The Press: Can I ask a follow-up on healthcare?,2306.604,3.403
The President has threatened to withhold,2310.007,2.469
cost-sharing payments from insurance companies.,2312.476,1.835
"So, is that still the case?",2314.311,2.269
Mr. Spicer: I think we&amp;#39;ve made it very clear,2316.58,2.136
that we want to repeal and replace Obamacare.,2318.716,1.835
And I think we continue to see -- there&amp;#39;s a prop-up,2320.551,3.704
"right now, and that&amp;#39;s why we need to act as soon",2324.255,2.702
as possible to get an insurance plan in place --,2326.957,2.236
a new insurance plan -- system in place that will,2329.193,2.469
protect people&amp;#39;s insurance and not have these,2331.662,2.002
skyrocketing costs.,2333.664,0.901
But we have an artificially propped-up,2334.565,3.47
insurance system right now because of these payments.,2338.035,2.169
And I think that we&amp;#39;ve got to make sure that we do,2340.204,2.402
"everything we can, as quick as we can, to put",2342.606,1.769
a system in place that will solve that.,2344.375,2.169
Jonathan.,2346.544,0.834
"The Press: So, just to follow up on the two,",2347.378,1.702
"three topics -- the wall and on -- first, on the",2349.08,2.836
"wall, I just want to be clear -- so is the",2351.916,3.703
President no longer insisting that there is,2355.619,1.735
money for the wall in this current appropriations bill?,2357.354,2.87
Mr. Spicer: The President&amp;#39;s priorities,2360.224,1.902
are clear for FY17.,2362.126,1.602
There&amp;#39;s a lot of things that we can do in,2363.728,2.669
"the remaining months, up until the end of September,",2366.397,2.936
for planning and making sure that we get everything,2369.333,2.536
"that we need, funding that we need for that aspect of things.",2371.869,3.904
"And then as we go into FY18, we&amp;#39;ll continue",2375.773,2.002
to ask for more.,2377.775,0.701
I don&amp;#39;t think anything has changed.,2378.476,1.334
"The Press: So, the President is not insisting",2379.81,1.568
that he has money for actual construction of,2381.378,2.169
the wall in this current bill?,2383.547,1.535
Mr. Spicer: We are still in discussions with,2385.082,2.102
"the House and Senate leadership, but I think",2387.184,1.635
the President has been very clear that he wants,2388.819,1.902
a wall; he wants it done as soon as we can do it.,2390.721,3.203
There are things that we need to do to protect,2393.924,1.836
"our country -- like human trafficking, the flow",2395.76,2.168
of illegal drugs and gangs -- that are going to make,2397.928,2.77
sure that while we&amp;#39;ve achieved a significant,2400.698,2.202
drop in illegal alien border crossings --,2402.9,2.469
down 61 percent since January -- that this is something,2405.369,2.236
that&amp;#39;s in our country&amp;#39;s long-term national,2407.605,2.002
security interest.,2409.607,1.168
The Press: And the actual construction can wait,2410.775,1.167
until the fall?,2411.942,1.101
"Mr. Spicer: No, it&amp;#39;s not a question of wait until the fall.",2413.043,1.335
I think there&amp;#39;s a lot of things that have to happen.,2414.378,1.769
It&amp;#39;s like any construction.,2416.147,1.368
The Press: Before you start construction.,2417.515,1.201
"Mr. Spicer: Well, you got to start doing some",2418.716,1.101
planning and things.,2419.817,1.101
And so we will take the first steps now and then,2420.918,1.802
we will continue to seek funding through the FY18,2422.72,2.335
and further budget to make sure that the actual --,2425.055,1.769
that it is completed.,2426.824,1.134
"The Press: And on Michael Flynn, does the President feel",2427.958,2.436
that he was misled by General Flynn?,2430.394,2.369
Mr. Spicer: I think the President made a decision,2432.763,2.403
a while ago because General Flynn was,2435.166,2.902
not straight with the Vice President at the time,2438.068,2.403
and let him go.,2440.471,1.168
"I think he stands by that decision, and it&amp;#39;s up to",2441.639,1.868
others to review all this information that&amp;#39;s coming out.,2443.507,3.504
The Press: But does he now feel that he also wasn&amp;#39;t,2447.011,1.668
straight with him in the beginning during --,2448.679,1.268
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t -- a lot of the facts are still,2449.947,1.535
"coming out, Jonathan.",2451.482,1.468
I know the President made a decision a couple months ago.,2452.95,2.536
"It was the right decision, and we&amp;#39;ve moved on.",2455.486,2.169
And we continue to stay focused on -- The Press:,2457.655,2.269
"At the time he made that decision, he said he was",2459.924,2.269
the victim of a media witch hunt and said he was,2462.193,2.836
a good man that had been a victim of --,2465.029,1.701
"Mr. Spicer: Right, so let&amp;#39;s --",2466.73,1.268
"The Press: -- a witch hunt, does he still feel that?",2467.998,1.402
Or is --,2469.4,2.235
Mr. Spicer: I think all the facts are still coming out on,2471.635,0.734
"that, let&amp;#39;s see where they come.",2472.369,1.335
I think he made a decision a few months ago.,2473.704,1.101
He stands by the decision.,2474.805,1.435
John.,2476.24,1.268
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",2477.508,1.835
Two questions: Last night the President said --,2479.343,2.102
and some have reported it -- some pretty sensational,2481.445,2.302
charges about the Iran treaty.,2483.747,1.969
We know he&amp;#39;s called it the worst agreement in,2485.716,2.703
"history, and the worst he ever saw himself.",2488.419,3.303
"But he also said that at the time of the treaty,",2491.722,3.17
the government in Iran was on the verge of collapsing.,2494.892,3.136
And that is something I don&amp;#39;t believe that has,2498.028,2.903
ever been reported before.,2500.931,1.669
He also said that the unfrozen assets --,2502.6,3.47
"the billions were not used to fund terrorists,",2506.07,2.936
but they were in Swiss bank accounts.,2509.006,3.704
Is this based on intelligence reports,2512.71,2.169
he&amp;#39;s received or other information?,2514.879,2.802
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not going to get into what,2517.681,1.268
"the President knows, but there is a reason that we are",2518.949,2.069
undergoing an interagency process right now to look,2521.018,2.636
at the deal.,2523.654,1.134
"Yes, Jessica.",2524.788,1.335
The Press: I had a second question.,2526.123,0.901
Mr. Spicer: Sure.,2527.024,0.934
The Press: Okay.,2527.958,2.202
"On General Flynn, anyone who is at his level",2530.16,3.771
and some levels below undergoes an investigation,2533.931,2.502
by the FBI with a final report.,2536.433,3.904
Was the President ever given a final security,2540.337,2.202
report by the FBI on General Flynn?,2542.539,2.47
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t know.,2545.009,2.302
He had -- he was the head of the Department --,2547.311,3.27
of the Defense Intelligence Agency.,2550.581,2.069
He had an existing clearance.,2552.65,1.468
Jessica.,2554.118,2.836
The Press: If you could just talk a little bit,2556.954,2.002
more about the overall efforts that the administration,2558.956,2.102
is making.,2561.058,1.168
We note the United Nations meetings yesterday.,2562.226,2.202
Now you&amp;#39;ve got an upcoming meeting with Congress.,2564.428,2.102
Are you as an administration trying,2566.53,1.969
to get a coalition together to build a stronger,2568.499,2.769
diplomatic case around actions against Pyongyang?,2571.268,3.404
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think you saw Ambassador Haley",2574.672,2.736
yesterday in the discussion that --,2577.408,3.103
the other ambassadors who visited the White House,2580.511,2.936
engaged in a very robust discussion with respect,2583.447,2.903
"to North Korea, both as a group, and then",2586.35,1.935
with the President.,2588.285,1.001
"So obviously, the more that we can solve this",2589.286,1.969
diplomatically and continue to apply pressure,2591.255,2.703
on China and other countries to use the,2593.958,2.902
political and economic tools that they have,2596.86,1.936
"to achieve a goal in stabilization in the region,",2598.796,3.236
but also to tamp down the threat that,2602.032,3.203
"North Korea faces, I think that is something that we all share.",2605.235,2.036
The Press: How would you characterize the,2607.271,1.668
administration&amp;#39;s overall strategy on the DPRK?,2608.939,3.604
Mr. Spicer: I think we&amp;#39;re -- it&amp;#39;s ongoing.,2612.543,2.869
And I think -- but I think we&amp;#39;ve seen very positive,2615.412,2.002
signs with respect to a nation like China.,2617.414,3.203
The relationship the President built with,2620.617,2.169
President Xi down in Mar-a-Lago is definitely,2622.786,2.903
paying off dividends.,2625.689,1.101
And this President&amp;#39;s relationships that he&amp;#39;s,2626.79,2.503
building with heads of government is clearly,2629.293,3.27
reestablishing America&amp;#39;s place in the world,2632.563,2.035
and getting results for this country.,2634.598,1.468
Kayla.,2636.066,1.735
The Press: -- strategy on Wednesday when you have,2637.801,1.502
the meeting with the senators?,2639.303,1.234
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m sorry?,2640.537,1.268
The Press: Will you be able to articulate that,2641.805,1.235
strategy and put a finer point on it for the senators?,2643.04,1.435
"Mr. Spicer: Just to be clear, that meeting",2644.475,1.134
is a Senate meeting led by Leader McConnell,2645.609,3.67
just utilizing our space.,2649.279,1.736
"So, that is their meeting, so we&amp;#39;re not there",2651.015,2.535
to talk strategy.,2653.55,0.734
There are going to be briefed by the --,2654.284,2.87
"The Press: Well, you --",2657.154,1.001
Mr. Spicer: Can I answer her question?,2658.155,0.934
"Major, I --",2659.089,1.168
The Press: -- it&amp;#39;s your administration --,2660.257,1.001
Mr. Spicer: Do you want to come on up?,2661.258,1.135
(Laughter.),2662.393,1.134
I mean I&amp;#39;ll -- I understand there around four -- hold on --,2663.527,1.702
The Press: -- characterize it as you presenting your strategy,2665.229,3.003
to the U.S. Senate?,2668.232,1.635
Mr. Spicer: There are four briefers that are coming,2669.867,1.168
up to talk about the situation in North Korea.,2671.035,2.469
They will be briefed by -- this is a Senate-led,2673.504,2.869
meeting that they are getting; those four,2676.373,2.069
briefers will share to them the current situation,2678.442,3.637
in North Korea.,2682.079,2.769
The Press: -- the strategy will be articulated then?,2684.848,1.335
Mr. Spicer: What?,2686.183,1.702
The Press: So the senators should not expect --,2687.885,1.935
"Mr. Spicer: Well, no, obviously, the Secretary of State",2689.82,1.401
and others are going to talk about,2691.221,1.502
our posture and the activities that we&amp;#39;re undergoing.,2692.723,2.769
And Chairman Dunford will lay out some,2695.492,2.369
of the military actions and the way that they see,2697.861,1.502
the lay of the land.,2699.363,1.101
"They&amp;#39;re going to answer questions, as they",2700.464,1.301
routinely do on a situation like this.,2701.765,2.102
Kayla.,2703.867,1.135
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",2705.002,1.635
How long would you reasonably expect,2706.637,1.902
the government to take to be fully staffed with,2708.539,2.168
"essential personnel to draft, negotiate,",2710.707,2.803
"and implement complicated policies like tax reform,",2713.51,3.003
and put forward something that&amp;#39;s a little bit,2716.513,2.403
more meaty than just broad principles?,2718.916,2.602
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think we&amp;#39;re going to --",2721.518,2.603
we&amp;#39;ll have something to share with you tomorrow.,2724.121,2.235
And then we&amp;#39;re going to continue to work with allies,2726.356,3.537
and individuals who want to be part of this process.,2729.893,1.735
That conversation has really kicked off,2731.628,2.203
in earnest with members of the House Ways and Means,2733.831,3.803
"Committee and Senate Finance Committee,",2737.634,1.635
the leadership.,2739.269,1.035
And so we will continue to engage in that discussion,2740.304,1.468
and outside stakeholders to try to get a plan,2741.772,4.504
really put together and details laid out in the,2746.276,1.769
next several weeks once we make the announcement tomorrow.,2748.045,2.803
The Press: But what progress have agencies,2750.848,1.701
been able to make in carrying out the executive,2752.549,3.837
orders that the President has put forward?,2756.386,1.469
Because today is actually the deadline for the,2757.855,1.501
regulatory reform offices to be in place.,2759.356,2.269
How many of those are there?,2761.625,1.335
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t have a number on that.,2762.96,1.034
I can look at -- talk to our personnel office,2763.994,2.102
and get back to you.,2766.096,1.068
"But I think we have been able to work with, in many",2767.164,2.102
cases -- and I think I went over this early on,2769.266,2.169
in the process -- but we installed what we called,2771.435,2.135
beachhead teams during the transition process.,2773.57,2.002
We put 400-plus individuals into,2775.572,2.403
"these departments that, in most cases, transformed",2777.975,2.936
into Schedule C employees.,2780.911,1.902
So we have been able to be up and running in almost,2782.813,2.636
"every one of these in a very, very early process",2785.449,2.102
when you look at the totality of how we handled,2787.551,2.269
the transition of government.,2789.82,1.668
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",2791.488,2.469
"Staying on taxes for a minute, can you give us",2793.957,2.203
a sense -- the President said he&amp;#39;s going to present,2796.16,1.835
this plan tomorrow.,2797.995,1.434
Can you give us a sense of what we&amp;#39;re going to see,2799.429,1.669
and when we&amp;#39;re going to see it?,2801.098,1.168
Mr. Spicer: No.,2802.266,1.101
I&amp;#39;m going to wait until tomorrow.,2803.367,1.034
I think we&amp;#39;ll have plenty of time to talk,2804.401,1.802
about that tomorrow.,2806.203,0.867
The Press: Just a bit of color.,2807.07,2.803
"The President, on Friday, when he announced that",2809.873,2.569
"it was going to happen on Wednesday, aides here",2812.442,2.603
at the White House and over at Treasury seemed,2815.045,1.668
a little bit surprised to find out that this,2816.713,1.335
was coming as early as Wednesday.,2818.048,1.301
Can you tell us who inside the White House,2819.349,1.202
and at Treasury the President told he was going to announce,2820.551,2.435
this on Wednesday before he made the announcement?,2822.986,1.702
"Mr. Spicer: I think tomorrow, we&amp;#39;ll have",2824.688,0.934
a great plan for you to see.,2825.622,1.035
Adam.,2826.657,2.969
The Press: The Secretary of Treasury actually said,2829.626,1.569
that the goal on tax reform is to spur growth,2831.195,1.534
"of 3 percent of more, but already people are worried",2832.729,1.335
about deficits and that&amp;#39;s -- Taxpayers For Common,2834.064,2.102
Sense put out a statement saying that growth --,2836.166,2.403
"&amp;quot;Hogwash, growth is the magic pixie dust policymakers throw",2838.569,2.736
on economic plans to make them appear fiscally sound,2841.305,2.269
when they are not.&amp;quot;,2843.574,1.134
What would you say to Republicans on Capitol Hill,2844.708,2.202
who are worried about this being a tax reform,2846.91,2.002
that would blow a hole in the deficit and the debt?,2848.912,2.336
Mr. Spicer: I will wait until tomorrow.,2851.248,2.002
You can see the plan.,2853.25,1.301
"But I think, obviously, we&amp;#39;ve got to do everything",2854.551,1.902
we can to get economic growth going and job creation going.,2856.453,2.903
The President has made tremendous headway on the,2859.356,1.902
"regulatory front, and he&amp;#39;s going to do everything",2861.258,2.235
he can on the tax front.,2863.493,1.435
But we&amp;#39;ve talked about this before.,2864.928,1.535
"I mean, if you look at the corporate side in",2866.463,1.401
"particular, we have become largely uncompetitive",2867.864,2.87
because of our rates.,2870.734,0.901
And I think the more we can do to make our,2871.635,2.703
"country, our businesses, our manufacturers",2874.338,2.302
"in particular, more competitive, that&amp;#39;s good",2876.64,2.102
"for American workers, it&amp;#39;s good for our economy,",2878.742,2.002
it&amp;#39;s good for economic growth.,2880.744,1.535
"And I think the President -- as I noted, I mean,",2882.279,2.936
when you look at the regulatory side of what,2885.215,2.97
"he has done, it has really helped a lot of industries",2888.185,3.003
start to see light.,2891.188,6.039
And that why I think you see the confidence levels in so many surveys so strong under this,2897.227,3.17
"President, because he&amp;#39;s achieved real results already.",2900.397,1.335
"So, I will see you guys tomorrow.",2901.732,1.234
We&amp;#39;ll talk about the tax plan.,2902.966,1.068
Thanks.,2904.034,1.001
