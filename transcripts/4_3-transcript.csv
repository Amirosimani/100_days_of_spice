"Mr. Spicer: Good afternoon, everybody.",0.967,0.367
Welcome back.,1.334,1.402
Got a busy week ahead of us.,2.736,1.401
"Before I get started, I want to just give you",4.137,4.538
a quick update on something I know in the past there&amp;#39;s,8.675,2.769
been several questions about the President,11.444,1.669
donating his salary to charity.,13.113,2.202
I got an update for you on that.,15.315,2.569
"To that end, the President has spoken with Counsel",17.884,4.671
and made the decision to donate his first-quarter,22.555,3.07
"salary, in total, to a government entity,",25.625,3.971
and he has chosen this quarter to donate it,29.596,3.703
to the National Park Service.,33.299,2.036
"The Park Service has cared for our parks since 1916,",35.335,3.17
and the President is personally proud,38.505,1.768
to contribute the first quarter of his salary,40.273,2.636
"to the important mission of the Park Service, which",42.909,1.735
is preserving our country&amp;#39;s national security.,44.644,3.036
"So, it is my pleasure, on behalf of the President",47.68,2.636
"of the United States, to present a check",50.316,1.602
"for $78,333 to the Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke,",51.918,3.904
"and Superintendent of the Harper&amp;#39;s Ferry Park site,",55.822,5.472
Superintendent Brandyburg.,61.294,5.038
The Press: After taxes?,66.332,1.068
"Mr. Spicer: No, it&amp;#39;s straight up.",67.4,1.301
It is every penny that the President received from,68.701,2.636
the first quarter since the day he was --,71.337,3.037
The Press: But it&amp;#39;s not a full quarter.,74.374,1.268
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, right, because the Constitution says that --",75.642,3.737
(laughter),79.379,1.334
"-- sorry, that was -- so it&amp;#39;s from January 20th noon forward",80.713,4.805
"Secretary Zinke: We think it will cash, though.",85.518,1.435
(Laughter.),86.953,1.068
"Mr. Spicer: With that, I&amp;#39;m going to let Secretary Zinke make",88.021,2.102
a few comments about the Department of Interior,90.123,1.568
and the work that they&amp;#39;re doing.,91.691,3.904
"Secretary Zinke: Well, thanks.",95.595,2.369
"I&amp;#39;m Secretary Zinke, from the Department of Interior,",97.964,1.802
for those who don&amp;#39;t know me.,99.766,1.168
"Obviously, great to be with you.",100.934,2.836
"Those who don&amp;#39;t know, I get my inspiration",103.77,2.469
from Teddy Roosevelt.,106.239,1.835
"And the motto now in the Department of Interior,",108.074,2.336
if you go to Yellowstone and you have the opportunity,110.41,2.269
"to look at the Roosevelt Arch, it says, inscribed",112.679,3.77
"in stone is, &amp;quot;For the benefit and enjoyment",116.449,2.136
of the people.&amp;quot; And that&amp;#39;s our pledge.,118.585,3.203
"So, for those who aren&amp;#39;t familiar with the",121.788,3.303
"Department of Interior, we span 12 time zones,",125.091,4.071
"from the Virgin Islands, all the way to Palau.",129.162,3.236
And within our holdings are 20 percent,132.398,1.802
of the nation&amp;#39;s land.,134.2,1.568
"We have 417 national parks, we have 562 federally recognized",135.768,7.241
"Indian nations, 567 wildlife refuges,",143.009,4.538
and 221 wilderness areas.,147.547,3.07
And I&amp;#39;m the steward of our nation&amp;#39;s finest,150.617,2.702
and most majestic holdings.,153.319,2.703
After riding on a horse on my first day --,156.022,2.069
"we were pretty busy -- just on public lands alone,",158.091,4.204
"I signed directions, on the first day, to expand",162.295,1.969
"public access -- important if you&amp;#39;re in the West,",164.264,2.969
"especially in the far West, as Montana is.",167.233,4.071
We&amp;#39;ve made sure we increased opportunities,171.304,1.835
"for traditional hunting, fishing,",173.139,3.17
and conservation efforts.,176.309,1.435
And we&amp;#39;ve invested millions across 12 states,177.744,4.07
on preserving our conservation efforts there.,181.814,3.704
"On energy, much of last week was spent on energy.",185.518,4.505
We held one of our most successful leases --,190.023,3.036
"122,000 acres for wind development on federal lands,",193.059,4.538
"off Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.",197.597,2.336
We also stopped the war on coal by continuing a coal,199.933,3.837
leasing program.,203.77,1.635
And I established an oversight committee,205.405,2.636
"to review and analyze across the board rents, royalties",208.041,6.64
"on our federal lands, with the objective of,",214.681,3.67
"number one, being transparent; number two, being Reagan --",218.351,4.738
"trust, but verify; and number three, making sure",223.089,2.803
the taxpayers that own the public lands are getting,225.892,3.336
fair value.,229.228,1.502
"On the management side, we have unfortunately",230.73,3.303
uncovered a lot of internal controls,234.033,2.937
that weren&amp;#39;t there.,236.97,2.335
There&amp;#39;s been in the news several incidents,239.305,2.069
of sexual harassment and a culture of discrimination.,241.374,3.837
And you can hear it from me -- I put policies forth --,245.211,3.737
zero tolerance for sexual harassment,248.948,3.937
or discrimination.,252.885,3.003
"We have 70,000 full-time employees, and each",255.888,3.938
employee deserves the right to enter a workplace,259.826,3.67
"that&amp;#39;s innovative, teamwork, but free from harassment.",263.496,3.537
"On the brighter side, we will pilot the first-ever",267.033,3.87
dog-friendly Department of Interior.,270.903,3.771
"Puppy Day is coming up, so we&amp;#39;ve established that.",274.674,3.47
"And people ask, why are you doing that?",278.144,2.236
"Well, in some way we compete on millennials.",280.38,4.371
So we&amp;#39;re trying to develop ourselves as a friendly,284.751,4.237
"department that&amp;#39;s going to work with people, who are",288.988,1.835
going to be an advocate for collaboration.,290.823,5.072
"And in doing that, we&amp;#39;re going to start",295.895,1.668
with being dog-friendly.,297.563,2.937
"And also, we&amp;#39;ve taken to Twitter.",300.5,2.369
"As you know, this administration",302.869,1.468
"is Twitter-friendly, and so am I -- @SecretaryZinke.",304.337,2.402
(Laughter.),306.739,3.938
"And finally, as a veteran myself, I tell you,",310.677,2.502
I am thrilled at the President&amp;#39;s decision to donate the check,313.179,3.971
he did today.,317.15,1.167
"I did talk to the President last night, and he has decided, as",318.317,3.671
"you know, to donate his entire quarter salary.",321.988,5.305
And we&amp;#39;re going to dedicate it and put it,327.293,1.435
against the infrastructure on our nation&amp;#39;s battlefields.,328.728,3.804
We&amp;#39;re about $100 or $229 million behind,332.532,3.503
"in deferred maintenance on our battlefields alone,",336.035,4.171
and that&amp;#39;s on our 25 national battlefields.,340.206,3.003
And we&amp;#39;re excited about that opportunity.,343.209,3.77
"So, thank you very much for the opportunity to be",346.979,3.404
"with you, and thank you for -- the American people",350.383,2.135
to trust the stewardship of our nation&amp;#39;s greatest,352.518,3.204
holdings with us.,355.722,2.068
"So, I&amp;#39;d like to thank our Superintendent Brandyburg",357.79,3.771
for being here.,361.561,0.667
He&amp;#39;s Harper&amp;#39;s Ferry.,362.228,0.801
"If you haven&amp;#39;t been out there, please do.",363.029,2.369
"With that, I&amp;#39;ll turn it back to Sean",365.398,1.301
and I will take questions.,366.699,1.335
The Press: How is that war on coal been working there?,368.034,1.868
You&amp;#39;re saying that you&amp;#39;re going to open it up,369.902,3.037
because of the war on coal.,372.939,1.268
Isn&amp;#39;t that kind of contrary to what Teddy Roosevelt,374.207,1.801
wanted in preserving land?,376.008,3.17
"Secretary Zinke: Well, there&amp;#39;s no doubt -- three things.",379.178,3.237
"One is, environmentally it&amp;#39;s better to produce energy",382.415,2.436
here under reasonable regulation than watch it get produced,384.851,3.103
overseas with none.,387.954,1.802
"Secondly, jobs matter.",389.756,1.468
There&amp;#39;s a social cost of not having a job.,391.224,3.136
"In some communities, coal mining, forestry",394.36,3.57
are the only jobs.,397.93,2.503
And you can take it from the Crow Nation,400.433,1.635
"in Montana, which I&amp;#39;m familiar with.",402.068,2.803
"Chairman Old Coyote -- the chairman once said, a war",404.871,3.136
"on coal is a war on Crow Nation, and coal jobs",408.007,2.87
are the only jobs.,410.877,1.601
"And lastly, national security.",412.478,2.202
"It is, from a SEAL perspective, it is better",414.68,3.604
to make sure we&amp;#39;re not held hostage on our energy,418.284,3.437
needs in this country.,421.721,2.335
"And like you, I don&amp;#39;t want my kids -- sons and",424.056,2.436
daughters -- to have to fight for war or energy,426.492,2.169
resources we have here.,428.661,1.835
So national security is critical in our energy picture.,430.496,5.239
"And look, the world is safer when America is",435.735,3.336
"stronger, and America stronger is not being",439.071,3.137
dependent on foreign services for energy.,442.208,2.869
"We can do it here right, and we will.",445.077,2.069
"I&amp;#39;m the steward, and certainly we&amp;#39;re not going",447.146,1.835
to sell or transfer public land.,448.981,2.77
And I don&amp;#39;t pick winners and losers.,451.751,2.702
"So, coal isn&amp;#39;t getting any more of a better deal",454.453,2.269
than anything else.,456.722,1.502
We&amp;#39;ll let the market play.,458.224,1.435
But I want to make sure that what we do,459.659,1.801
"is cost-effective and it produces reliable,",461.46,3.537
"abundant, and affordable energy.",464.997,1.936
"The Press: But I think, to the point, are you going",466.933,1.234
"to return the land to its original, pristine value",468.167,4.405
when you&amp;#39;re done?,472.572,1.101
Secretary Zinke: I&amp;#39;m a Boy Scout.,473.673,1.234
"So, I was taught long ago that when you leave",474.907,2.636
"a campground, you leave it in the same or better",477.543,1.702
condition than you found it.,479.245,1.468
And that&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re looking at royalties,480.713,1.468
to make sure we have a reclamation program,482.181,1.835
that makes sense.,484.016,1.268
"All of us want clean air, clean water.",485.284,2.77
"And I&amp;#39;m concerned, as well as you are, to make sure",488.054,2.636
what we&amp;#39;re doing is in the best interest,490.69,1.968
of the public in perpetuity.,492.658,2.469
Last question.,495.127,0.801
The Press: Have you thought about,495.928,1.835
re-designating the Gold Butte Monument in Nevada?,497.763,2.636
Secretary Zinke: We are looking at everything,500.399,2.703
across the board.,503.102,1.435
"When I came in, there was a lot of talk about",504.537,3.737
"different monuments in different places,",508.274,1.835
and I talked to the senators.,510.109,1.769
"And so, everything is on the board, looking at it.",511.878,2.902
"No monument in specific, but looking at the process,",514.78,3.504
"looking at the law, making sure that the monuments",518.284,2.269
follow the law.,520.553,1.935
"And at the end of the day, it&amp;#39;s important that",522.488,3.437
we operate collaboratively.,525.925,1.768
"If you&amp;#39;re outside of Washington, D.C., there&amp;#39;s a lot",527.693,3.637
of anger out there.,531.33,2.236
"And I want the Department of Interior, our rangers",533.566,3.337
"and land managers, to be first viewed as rangers",536.903,3.47
"and land managers, not law enforcement.",540.373,2.402
I don&amp;#39;t want us to be heavy-handed.,542.775,2.102
"And I want us to work with local communities, because",544.877,3.003
that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;re embedded.,547.88,1.702
"Our rangers, they have children, they play",549.582,4.204
"soccer, they coach, they do all those things --",553.786,3.036
I want to make sure the Department of Interior,556.822,1.869
"is the department that works with local communities,",558.691,4.304
"works with the states, and we want to be the &amp;quot;yep&amp;quot;",562.995,2.603
team; that means be an advocate rather than an adversary.,565.598,4.871
Thanks.,570.469,3.471
We&amp;#39;ll come back.,573.94,5.171
Mr. Spicer: Okay.,579.111,1.268
"I know it&amp;#39;s already been a full first day back,",580.379,2.169
but I want to run down a couple of quick things that happened,582.548,2.136
over the weekend.,584.684,1.501
We&amp;#39;re fortunate to be championing many great,586.185,1.735
causes during the month of April that are near,587.92,2.236
and dear to the White House.,590.156,0.834
We released several proclamations on Friday,590.99,3.27
that are available at White House.gov.,594.26,2.703
"This morning, specifically,",596.963,1.201
the President proclaimed April 2nd through the 8th,598.164,2.202
as National Crime Victims&amp;#39; Rights Week.,600.366,2.736
"On Saturday, the President declared a major disaster",603.102,3.036
in the state of California as a result of severe,606.138,2.536
winter storm flooding and mudslides in February.,608.674,3.237
Federal assistance will be supplementing recovery efforts,611.911,2.769
in the area moving forward.,614.68,1.602
"Also on Saturday, the Vice President traveled",616.282,1.835
"to Columbus, Ohio to discuss American jobs and the economy.",618.117,3.904
"He spoke with business leaders at DynaLab, an American-owned",622.021,3.17
and operated electronic manufacturing services company.,625.191,3.303
The Vice President told the crowd that the actions,628.494,2.069
that the President has already taken to create,630.563,1.735
"jobs in this country make it easier to do business,",632.298,3.403
from taking a serious look at the regulatory process,635.701,2.87
to ushering in a new era of American energy.,638.571,3.303
"With respect to today, the President, as you know,",641.874,2.102
welcomed President Al-Sisi of Egypt to the White House,643.976,2.87
this morning.,646.846,0.901
The two Presidents had an honest discussion focused,647.747,2.435
on areas of cooperation.,650.182,1.869
The President made clear that this is a new day,652.051,2.069
"in the relationship between Egypt and the United States,",654.12,2.736
and the President affirmed his strong,656.856,1.701
support of the Egyptian people.,658.557,1.969
It was a candid dialogue during which they,660.526,1.869
discussed both areas of cooperation and of concern.,662.395,3.87
"Also, this morning, the White House released the",666.265,1.602
"official portrait of the First Lady, which is similarly",667.867,3.37
available on White House.gov.,671.237,1.835
"And just about now, the President began a meeting",673.072,3.07
"with Secretary of State Tillerson, where they&amp;#39;re",676.142,2.035
"expected to discuss several topics,",678.177,1.635
including the Secretary&amp;#39;s recent trip to Brussels,679.812,2.169
where he attended the NATO foreign ministers meeting.,681.981,3.537
"As you may have known, just prior to the briefing,",685.518,2.102
the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to advance,687.62,2.269
the President&amp;#39;s selection for Neil Gorsuch to the full Senate.,689.889,4.404
While the White House was pleased that beyond,694.293,3.203
"the committee partisan vote, more Democrats have moved",697.496,3.137
passed partisan obstruction to acknowledge,700.633,2.469
that Judge Gorsuch is simply qualified,703.102,3.17
"and deserving to be on the bench, but we&amp;#39;re obviously",706.272,2.102
disappointed that the overwhelming majority,708.374,2.202
of them are still playing politics with the nation&amp;#39;s,710.576,1.935
highest court.,712.511,1.135
If the Democrats get their way -- and I know,713.646,1.601
the numbers are looking that way -- this is going to be,715.247,2.603
the first successful filibuster of a nominee,717.85,2.236
"to join the Supreme Court, which is clearly unprecedented.",720.086,4.771
"With a vote on Judge Gorsuch expected Friday,",724.857,2.269
the American people will see which senators are,727.126,1.668
willing to keep this seat open to get in the way,728.794,2.569
of President Trump making progress on one of his,731.363,2.803
most significant choices so far.,734.166,3.437
"Also, today opens the application process",737.603,3.437
for this year&amp;#39;s H1B visas.,741.04,1.868
The President has spoken about the H1B visa program,742.908,2.436
in the past.,745.344,0.968
The White House acknowledges that there,746.312,1.334
are issues with the program as it currently,747.646,1.702
"stands; however, there are several laws that are on",749.348,2.97
the books that went unenforced in the previous administration.,752.318,3.937
As the Department of Justice made clear and was,756.255,1.969
"released this morning, the Trump administration will",758.224,2.869
be enforcing laws protecting American,761.093,2.302
workers from discriminating hiring practices.,763.395,3.337
Looking ahead to the schedule for the rest,766.732,1.668
"of the week, the President will host a CEO town hall",768.4,2.67
meeting on the business climate tomorrow morning.,771.07,2.936
"And then in the afternoon, he&amp;#39;ll make remarks",774.006,2.102
to the 2017 North America&amp;#39;s Building Trades Union,776.108,3.303
National Legislative Conference.,779.411,2.203
"On Wednesday, as I mentioned last week,",781.614,1.434
he will host His Majesty King Abdullah II of Jordan.,783.048,3.571
"And on Thursday, after welcoming participants",786.619,2.269
"of the Wounded Warrior Project, Soldier Ride,",788.888,3.103
the President will depart for a visit with President Xi,791.991,2.169
of China to Mar-a-Lago.,794.16,2.035
The President has been briefed on the devastating,796.195,1.802
flooding that has killed several hundred people in,797.997,1.768
"Colombia, and we are working closely",799.765,2.035
with the governments of both Colombia and Peru to support,801.8,2.603
efforts to address the extensive losses,804.403,2.402
and damage caused by this natural disaster.,806.805,3.204
The President has also been briefed on today&amp;#39;s attacks,810.009,2.469
in the St. Petersburg metro.,812.478,2.936
The United States condemns this reprehensible attack,815.414,3.003
and act of violence.,818.417,1.301
Our thoughts and prayers are with the injured,819.718,1.635
and with the Russian people as we extend our deepest,821.353,1.969
condolences to the loved ones who have been killed,823.322,2.836
and injured.,826.158,1.235
Attacks like these on ordinary citizens just,827.393,2.135
going about their lives remind us that the world,829.528,2.703
must work as one to combat violence in all forms.,832.231,3.303
The United States is prepared to offer,835.534,1.602
assistance to Russia that it may require in,837.136,2.569
investigating this crime.,839.705,1.568
"And with that, I&amp;#39;ll be glad to take your questions.",841.273,3.57
Cecilia.,844.843,0.668
The Press: Thanks.,845.511,0.667
A couple questions on the same topic.,846.178,1.835
Jared Kushner&amp;#39;s trip to Iraq today -- why is he there,848.013,4.071
and not the Secretary of State?,852.084,2.369
What is the message that the President is sending,854.453,1.902
by having Jared Kushner be the one to take this trip?,856.355,3.804
Mr. Spicer: I don&amp;#39;t think -- it&amp;#39;s not a binary choice.,860.159,2.736
"In this particular case, both Jared Kushner and Tom",862.895,4.371
"Bossert, the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security,",867.266,2.869
are on the trip at the request and invitation,870.135,2.937
"of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,",873.072,1.968
who was going there and believed it was,875.04,1.335
an opportunity for both of them.,876.375,2.569
"It&amp;#39;s, ironically, the first trip for both",878.944,2.87
Mr. Kushner and Mr. Bossert.,881.814,2.235
They&amp;#39;re going to receive briefings and updates,884.049,1.869
"with respect to what&amp;#39;s going on on the ground,",885.918,3.236
"our military involvement there, and our efforts",889.154,2.203
to defeat ISIS.,891.357,2.903
Jared is going to specifically express,894.26,2.369
the commitment of U.S. -- of the United States to the government,896.629,3.003
"of Iraq, meet with U.S. personnel",899.632,2.669
engaged in the campaign.,902.301,0.968
And Mr. Bossert will participate in meetings,903.269,2.736
and briefings to reinforce the strong U.S.-Iraqi,906.005,2.769
partnership to defeat ISIS.,908.774,1.535
But it&amp;#39;s not like this is a one-shot deal.,910.309,3.303
In the course of conversation and extensive,913.612,2.936
"meetings, that invitation was extended and they took it up.",916.548,1.902
The Press: His portfolio is jam-packed.,918.45,1.936
It has grown in recent weeks.,920.386,2.769
Among the things that is our understanding that are,923.155,3.237
"in his portfolio, he is to broker Middle East peace",926.392,2.669
and overhaul the federal government.,929.061,1.902
Can he do all of these things?,930.963,1.702
Mr. Spicer: I think -- not to -- it&amp;#39;s not like he does --,932.665,3.703
"he has a team that he oversees, and I think",936.368,2.236
there&amp;#39;s a lot of areas that he has been working,938.604,2.669
"very diligently on behalf of the government,",941.273,1.735
on behalf of the President&amp;#39;s agenda.,943.008,1.335
So going over and getting a firsthand understanding,944.343,2.803
of the work that&amp;#39;s being done -- to thank the government,947.146,3.17
"of Iraq, to see some of the sacrifice and progress",950.316,3.703
that our team is making on the U.S. side -- is an opportunity,954.019,3.337
that I think every government official and every member,957.356,2.736
"of the media should, frankly, take advantage of if offered",960.092,2.069
that opportunity.,962.161,1.001
Matt.,963.162,1.568
The Press: A recent ProPublica report out,964.73,2.069
today revealed that President Trump can draw,966.799,2.302
money from his businesses at any time without disclosing it.,969.101,4.404
"So, on that, I have two questions.",973.505,2.203
"One, has the President withdrawn any money from",975.708,2.469
his businesses since taking office?,978.177,1.401
"And two, can the White House commit that",979.578,2.536
the President will disclose future withdrawals,982.114,3.403
if they take place?,985.517,1.602
Mr. Spicer: I&amp;#39;m not sure what he&amp;#39;s withdrawn.,987.119,2.035
I think that -- I&amp;#39;m somewhat surprised in the,989.154,3.003
sense that anyone would find it shocking.,992.157,2.136
"A blind trust, or any kind of trust, rather,",994.293,2.169
the whole entire point of setting it up is that,996.462,2.302
somebody can withdraw money.,998.764,1.201
"And that&amp;#39;s, frankly, part of the point of setting it up.",999.965,2.436
The Press: Then why was this change not made -- it,1002.401,2.703
was made after -- (inaudible) --,1005.104,1.935
"Mr. Spicer: No, no, I do -- but again, I think that you",1007.039,4.905
"just went and started to say, &amp;quot;This change was made.&amp;quot;",1011.944,2.636
I&amp;#39;m not aware that there was any change.,1014.58,1.735
Just because a left-wing blog makes the point of,1016.315,3.103
something changing doesn&amp;#39;t mean it actually happened.,1019.418,2.769
I&amp;#39;m not aware that there was ever a change in the trust.,1022.187,2.536
And the idea that the President is withdrawing,1024.723,2.803
money at some point is exactly the purpose of,1027.526,3.57
what the trust -- why a trust is set up regardless,1031.096,2.736
of an individual.,1033.832,1.068
The Press: So just last question on this.,1034.9,1.502
"So, you&amp;#39;re not saying whether or not it has changed?",1036.402,2.769
"Just to clarify, you&amp;#39;re not sure whether this was --",1039.171,1.702
"Mr. Spicer: No, no.",1040.873,0.867
"I&amp;#39;m actually -- to the best of my knowledge,",1041.74,2.436
it hasn&amp;#39;t changed.,1044.176,1.068
Olivier.,1045.244,0.7
The Press: I got a couple for you.,1045.944,4.438
"One, there are multiple reports that the administration",1050.382,1.969
is looking at arms packages for,1052.351,2.702
"Taiwan, including missile defense and fighter jets.",1055.053,2.803
Can you confirm or clarify?,1057.856,1.936
Mr. Spicer: No.,1059.792,0.634
I&amp;#39;m not going to discuss.,1060.426,1.267
The Press: Okay.,1061.693,1.202
"And then, last August, the President sharply criticized",1062.895,2.769
then-President Obama for not making more of a public case,1065.664,3.27
for human rights throughout the Muslim world --,1068.934,2.302
throughout the Arab world.,1071.236,1.268
You guys have now said that it&amp;#39;s better to raise,1072.504,2.703
those issues privately; I&amp;#39;m trying to understand,1075.207,1.668
the evolution of the thinking there.,1076.875,1.602
What changed his mind?,1078.477,1.969
Mr. Spicer: What changed --,1080.446,1.267
The Press: The President&amp;#39;s mind.,1081.713,0.968
Mr. Spicer: I think the President recognizes,1082.681,1.168
that those are conversations where we can --,1083.849,3.537
as I said in the statement -- that there are areas of --,1087.386,3.07
that we can work with in cooperation and concern.,1090.456,2.969
And that&amp;#39;s best discussed privately in terms of how,1093.425,2.97
we address areas that need to be discussed like that,1096.395,3.503
in order to make progress on them.,1099.898,1.335
I don&amp;#39;t think that should be a huge surprise.,1101.233,2.302
"The Press: Did he raise them in this meeting,",1103.535,1.335
do you know?,1104.87,1.101
"Mr. Spicer: Again, I&amp;#39;m not going to get into what",1105.971,1.268
"they discussed privately, but I will tell you that",1107.239,1.435
"we understand the concern, and I think those are the",1108.674,2.469
kind of things that I believe progress,1111.143,1.902
is made privately.,1113.045,2.068
Sarah.,1115.113,1.369
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",1116.482,1.101
I have two.,1117.583,1.101
"One, has President Trump spoken with President",1118.684,2.469
Vladimir Putin about the terror attack in Russia?,1121.153,3.003
Mr. Spicer: Not yet.,1124.156,1.234
"I know that, obviously, the President of Egypt",1125.39,3.07
"just left moments ago, prior to me coming out.",1128.46,3.27
"But I do know that, as I mentioned at the top, our",1131.73,2.636
teams have been reaching out to both the government,1134.366,2.669
"of Russia, the government of Colombia --",1137.035,1.969
"and I know that there has been some outreach, I believe,",1139.004,3.437
to the folks -- the government of Peru,1142.441,2.436
"with respect to their situation, the mudslides there.",1144.877,3.436
"And then obviously, the violence that occurred",1148.313,2.77
in Russia is something that we&amp;#39;ve already started,1151.083,2.402
reaching out from a government-to-government standpoint.,1153.485,1.802
"If there is a call, we will make sure",1155.287,2.669
that we read that out.,1157.956,1.969
The Press: Okay.,1159.925,0.901
"And secondly, Senator Rand Paul has called",1160.826,1.835
the reports that Susan Rice ordered the unmasking,1162.661,2.536
of President Trump&amp;#39;s associates a &amp;quot;smoking gun.&amp;quot;,1165.197,2.803
Does the President agree with that characterization?,1168,2.636
And what does he think of these reports?,1170.636,2.402
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, I saw Senator Paul&amp;#39;s tweet.",1173.038,3.27
"Look, I think -- I want to make sure I&amp;#39;m clear and consistent.",1176.308,2.836
"I think we&amp;#39;ve been trying to say that, from the get-go,",1179.144,2.803
that there&amp;#39;s been an ongoing investigation,1181.947,2.569
that we have supported.,1184.516,1.535
"Looking into this matter, I will say that we have",1186.051,3.537
continued to say that I think there is a troubling,1189.588,2.836
"direction that some of this is going in,",1192.424,3.137
but we&amp;#39;re going to let this review go on before,1195.561,5.739
we jump to it.,1201.3,1.134
But I think that it is interesting the level,1202.434,3.036
of -- or the lack of interest that I&amp;#39;ve seen in these,1205.47,2.937
developments when it goes in one direction versus,1208.407,2.435
where I think it was going -- where other amounts,1210.842,3.07
of interest that have come from this room and beyond.,1213.912,2.536
I am somewhat surprised in terms of the level of,1216.448,3.303
interest that I&amp;#39;ve seen from The Press corps at one set,1219.751,2.57
of developments versus another set of developments.,1222.321,2.502
"That being said, I&amp;#39;m not going to start getting",1224.823,1.602
into a further discussion of that.,1226.425,3.003
Blake.,1229.428,0.667
"The Press: Sean, thanks.",1230.095,0.767
Let me pick up here.,1230.862,1.736
"A couple questions, but I&amp;#39;ll start here.",1232.598,1.368
Does the White House believe Susan Rice,1233.966,1.401
may have done anything illegal?,1235.367,1.335
Mr. Spicer: I think -- I&amp;#39;m not going to --,1236.702,1.902
appreciate the effort there.,1238.604,1.868
I&amp;#39;m not going to start going down that road.,1240.472,3.303
"As we&amp;#39;ve said before, we go down one road, we need",1243.775,2.136
to go down them all.,1245.911,1.068
"And I think at this point, we have supported this",1246.979,3.436
review that we&amp;#39;ve asked for.,1250.415,1.569
But I do think that when you see the developments,1251.984,3.269
"that we&amp;#39;ve seen in terms of the public,",1255.253,3.037
on-the-record comments that Dr. Farkas --,1258.29,1.902
"Evelyn Farkas, who is the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Defense",1260.192,3.804
"for Russian Affairs, said very publicly that this was",1263.996,2.902
part of an attempt of the Obama administration,1266.898,3.003
"to spread classified information, and then",1269.901,3.37
"you see the developments that have happened today,",1273.271,2.269
"I would just say that as, again, I&amp;#39;m -- somewhat more",1275.54,2.336
from a media standpoint -- somewhat intrigued,1277.876,3.203
by the lack of interest that we&amp;#39;ve seen,1281.079,1.936
in some of these public revelations in reporting,1283.015,2.736
that has gone in that direction that we&amp;#39;ve seen,1285.751,2.068
in some of the other directions that we&amp;#39;ve seen.,1287.819,1.735
"That being said, I&amp;#39;m not going to get into --",1289.554,2.436
"The Press: So, let me ask you, as it relates to Neil Gorsuch,",1291.99,3.47
is the White House comfortable with the nuclear option,1295.46,2.403
potentially being invoked?,1297.863,2.235
Mr. Spicer: The President said several weeks ago,1300.098,3.437
that this was something that he would support.,1303.535,3.871
We&amp;#39;re comfortable in the sense that obviously,1307.406,1.835
that decision is up to Leader McConnell to make how he wants,1309.241,2.736
the Senate to deal with this.,1311.977,3.103
I think the Majority Leader&amp;#39;s comments are very,1315.08,2.135
clear in the direction that he&amp;#39;s heading in.,1317.215,1.535
But I think this is -- we have entered a whole,1318.75,3.771
new league if this goes forward in terms,1322.521,2.669
of Democrats really going and saying -- it&amp;#39;s one thing to vote,1325.19,2.536
"against the nominee; we&amp;#39;ve seen that in the past,",1327.726,2.336
and I understand that.,1330.062,1.067
But we&amp;#39;ve now gone from the devolution of agreeing,1331.129,3.771
that there are certain people that a President,1334.9,2.369
"has the right -- as long as they&amp;#39;re qualified, right?",1337.269,2.869
"We&amp;#39;ve seen that in the past; John Roberts,",1340.138,1.569
"I think, got 78 votes.",1341.707,2.035
"But when you see that going one direction,",1343.742,2.903
versus now that there&amp;#39;s literally going to be the,1346.645,1.835
first filibuster in modern times on a qualified judge,1348.48,3.804
"that going to end up going on the court,",1352.284,1.601
we have really come a long way.,1353.885,1.669
And I think Democrats are setting a very dangerous,1355.554,4.037
precedent when it comes to how they want to do this.,1359.591,4.037
Because this isn&amp;#39;t about voting against somebody,1363.628,1.802
or having an issue with them.,1365.43,1.602
It is literally trying to stop -- using the,1367.032,2.836
filibuster for something that it was never intended for.,1369.868,2.603
Nor has it ever really been the principle that we,1372.471,1.968
would vote down someone who was qualified.,1374.439,2.469
Trey.,1376.908,0.868
"The Press: Thank you, Sean.",1377.776,1.068
What is President Trump doing behind the scenes,1378.844,1.234
"to make sure that his pick for the Supreme Court,",1380.078,2.469
"Judge Neil Gorsuch, ultimately is confirmed by the Senate?",1382.547,2.937
And what message does he have for Democrats,1385.484,1.234
on Capitol Hill who have said they&amp;#39;re going to filibuster?,1386.718,2.236
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I mean, if you look at --",1388.954,1.835
"I think it&amp;#39;s four Democrats that are now supporting, saying",1390.789,2.636
that they&amp;#39;re going to vote against the filibuster.,1393.425,3.17
I think we feel good about that level of support.,1396.595,2.068
"We&amp;#39;ve, I think, done a very good job of making",1398.663,2.97
sure that we have the Republican majority,1401.633,2.669
support that we need to pass it.,1404.302,1.502
It is now an internal question for senators,1405.804,2.436
to determine how they want to do it.,1408.24,1.668
But make no mistake -- and I believe Leader McConnell,1409.908,2.002
"when he says, on Friday, Judge Gorsuch will be",1411.91,3.637
voted as the next Supreme Court Justice.,1415.547,2.502
The Press: Can you just take me through what,1418.049,1.068
Friday looks like for the President?,1419.117,1.468
"Obviously, a major meeting with the President of China,",1420.585,1.869
but his eyes are going to be here on Washington.,1422.454,2.235
Is he going to making phone calls Thursday night,1424.689,1.769
trying to gauge the situation?,1426.458,1.368
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I think he&amp;#39;s going to be --",1427.826,1.068
we look forward to heading down to Florida Thursday,1428.894,2.035
to engage in some bilateral and --,1430.929,3.37
bilateral-plus meetings -- meetings with the,1434.299,2.936
President and his team from China.,1437.235,2.603
"Obviously, that will continue into Friday morning.",1439.838,1.835
But we&amp;#39;ll see how Friday evolves.,1441.673,2.269
"But, again, I&amp;#39;m not -- I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s any",1443.942,2.436
"question right now, according to Leader McConnell and others,",1446.378,3.937
that we&amp;#39;re going to have an associate justice of,1450.315,2.736
the Supreme Court ready to go.,1453.051,1.368
It&amp;#39;s a question of how it happens.,1454.419,1.502
Zeke.,1455.921,1.134
"The Press: Thanks, Sean.",1457.055,1.034
Just a couple questions about the check presentation,1458.089,1.535
earlier in the briefing.,1459.624,2.97
"You mentioned that, when he decided to give",1462.594,2.436
the money to the Park Service and had the advice of counsel.,1465.03,2.135
Is there going to be an issue with him making,1467.165,1.802
a donation to a non-profit?,1468.967,2.703
Mr. Spicer: I think there was just -- that when,1471.67,1.601
"given the options, he decided that there was",1473.271,2.937
a list of government entities that can accept donations.,1476.208,5.672
"Ironically, it&amp;#39;s not as easy to give money to the",1481.88,1.835
government as you would think -- aside from the IRS.,1483.715,4.238
(Laughter.),1487.953,1.534
"And then, I don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;re giving, but my point is, is that",1489.487,5.139
"he looked through a variety, and for this quarter he chose",1494.626,4.171
the National Park Service.,1498.797,2.269
But it was a decision that he made based on --,1501.066,2.536
"his counsel presented him with several options,",1503.602,1.835
and he believed that -- as Secretary Zinke pointed out --,1505.437,4.204
that there was some great work being done,1509.641,1.335
"there, especially that needed to do to restore",1510.976,2.035
"our great battlegrounds, and wanted to do his --",1513.011,2.669
The Press: Speaking of giving money,1515.68,1.001
"to the federal government, the President has been --",1516.681,1.969
going to Mar-a-Lago again this weekend --,1518.65,1.768
has been facing calls from both officials in New York,1520.418,3.037
and in Florida either to appropriate federal funds,1523.455,3.203
"or request federal funds, which were not in the budget",1526.658,1.668
"for the additional security burdens that they have faced,",1528.326,2.636
"given his residence there, travels to those places,",1530.962,3.837
or to reimburse those local governments,1534.799,2.837
out of his own pocket.,1537.636,1.201
"Obviously, this President is far wealthier",1538.837,1.601
"than any President we&amp;#39;ve seen in modern times, and he has",1540.438,2.77
the capability to make those outlays.,1543.208,2.736
"Is that something the President is considering,",1545.944,2.169
or has he decided to make those outlays to reimburse the --,1548.113,2.269
Mr. Spicer: I think there&amp;#39;s a few things.,1550.382,1.167
"Number one, the request to go to Mar-a-Lago was",1551.549,3.037
something that was negotiated with the Chinese.,1554.586,7.341
And so I think this is a very high-level visit that,1561.927,1.334
really has a huge impact on both economic,1563.261,1.502
and national security.,1564.763,2.135
"Secondly, the President has an opportunity,",1566.898,2.503
as all Presidents -- President Bush traveled to Crawford;,1569.401,2.269
President Obama went to Hawaii often --,1571.67,1.935
this is not something that you can control.,1573.605,2.669
There is a security aspect that the Secret Service,1576.274,2.603
determines when the President and the family travels.,1578.877,2.836
That&amp;#39;s not dictated by the President of the United States.,1581.713,3.337
"And third, I would note, ironically, this is a day",1585.05,2.602
that the President just donated a significant amount,1587.652,3.203
"of money of his salary back to the federal government, and so",1590.855,4.905
"respectfully, it&amp;#39;s like -- at what point does he do enough?",1595.76,3.904
He just gave a very sizable donation --,1599.664,2.303
"The Press: (Inaudible), though, that&amp;#39;s a very small --",1601.967,1.901
Mr. Spicer: But that&amp;#39;s not how we judge -- I think to be able,1603.868,2.636
"to say that -- he isn&amp;#39;t taking a salary, I think he&amp;#39;s stepped",1606.504,3.003
down from his business.,1609.507,0.868
He&amp;#39;s walked away from a lot.,1610.375,1.201
I think at some point he&amp;#39;s done quite a bit in terms,1611.576,8.075
of handing -- making a donation to the government.,1619.651,3.37
John.,1623.021,1.001
"The Press: Sean, back on Susan Rice, if I could.",1624.022,2.135
The fact that it&amp;#39;s allegedly the former,1626.157,2.87
national security advisor who requested the unmasking,1629.027,3.403
when it came to the incidental collection,1632.43,1.435
of people who were associated with,1633.865,0.934
the Trump campaign and the Trump transition puts that now,1634.799,2.803
squarely in the White House.,1637.602,2.002
"When you look at that, combine it with the NSC rules",1639.604,2.703
that were promulgated at the end of the Obama administration,1642.307,2.703
"to more broadly share intelligence,",1645.01,2.268
does this White House look at what she allegedly requested,1647.278,3.104
as a national security issue or a political issue?,1650.382,3.937
"Mr. Spicer: Well, I&amp;#39;m not going to -- that&amp;#39;s a nice",1654.319,3.07
backdoor into a line of questioning.,1657.389,2.235
"I think until there&amp;#39;s a finding of that, I don&amp;#39;t",1659.624,4.438
"want to start getting into the motives, because",1664.062,1.935
"we still have a -- again, me getting to the motives",1665.997,3.537
assumes certain things in fact that I don&amp;#39;t think,1669.534,2.803
"we&amp;#39;re ready to go to yet, because that, again, would",1672.337,2.102
be getting in the middle of an investigation.,1674.439,1.435
I do think that there&amp;#39;s been enough public,1675.874,1.935
discussion and reporting on this stuff that I&amp;#39;m not,1677.809,3.637
going to comment on this any further until those,1681.446,4.304
committees have come to a conclusion of that sort.,1685.75,2.736
So we&amp;#39;re not going to start going down --,1688.486,2.67
guessing the motives of something that is not assumed,1691.156,1.501
in fact yet.,1692.657,1.034
"But I do think that it is interesting,",1693.691,3.003
"as I mentioned earlier, the level or lack thereof",1696.694,2.069
of interest in this subject versus what has been,1698.763,3.003
commented on previously in terms of alleged people,1701.766,4.605
involved and processes.,1706.371,1.735
"So, I think there is --",1708.106,0.767
Margaret.,1708.873,1.001
"The Press: Sean, you mentioned that Jared Kushner",1709.874,2.236
has a team working with him.,1712.11,1.601
Can you help us understand exactly what&amp;#39;s,1713.711,2.303
in the portfolio and who&amp;#39;s on the team?,1716.014,2.202
And I have a follow to that.,1718.216,1.101
"Mr. Spicer: Yeah, he&amp;#39;s announced the Office",1719.317,1.101
of American Innovation the other day.,1720.418,1.368
We named a bunch of those folks that have been part,1721.786,3.203
of that team.,1724.989,0.668
And as you looked at various aspects,1725.657,1.101
"of government, he works with different people in the",1726.758,3.637
White House that oversee different parts of that,1730.395,3.203
"portfolio, whether it&amp;#39;s part of the team that&amp;#39;s",1733.598,2.736
doing the Middle East was one thing; you&amp;#39;ve got,1736.334,2.336
"Jason Greenblatt, who&amp;#39;s been traveling",1738.67,2.335
to the Middle East and other places to do that.,1741.005,2.603
There&amp;#39;s people like Reed Cordish and Chris Liddell,1743.608,2.002
that are part of the team that are talking about,1745.61,1.535
the Office of American Innovation that he discussed,1747.145,4.304
last week with respect to opioid use and others.,1751.449,3.37
"So, there is a team, depending on the subject,",1754.819,3.07
"that is working with him, and he is providing",1757.889,3.237
oversight and direction.,1761.126,1.167
"The Press: So, he&amp;#39;s overseeing teams handling",1762.293,1.802
"all these different issues -- whether it&amp;#39;s Mexico,",1764.095,2.102
"Canada, Israel, Palestine, Iraq, Saudi, all of that.",1766.197,3.671
Mr. Spicer: Sure.,1769.868,1.101
"Well, again, remember, on Iraq, don&amp;#39;t go too far there.",1770.969,2.235
"He was invited by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,",1773.204,2.136
"as was Tom Bossert, the Assistant to the President",1775.34,2.235
"for Homeland Security, to see the work that&amp;#39;s being done",1777.575,2.77
there firsthand.,1780.345,0.834
"I don&amp;#39;t think to sort of then translate it into,",1781.179,2.302
&amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s overseeing Iraq&amp;quot; is an accurate assessment.,1783.481,3.037
He was invited to go see something by the Chairman,1786.518,2.535
"of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and he&amp;#39;s doing it.",1789.053,1.535
The Press: But my follow on that is -- I appreciate,1790.588,3.537
how he&amp;#39;s in such a unique position and so trusted,1794.125,2.569
"by the President, but there are people who could look",1796.694,2.303
"at the situation and say, the White House",1798.997,2.435
isn&amp;#39;t meant to be run as a family business.,1801.432,2.369
There are institutions with experienced diplomats,1803.801,2.703
who have years of decades of linguistic and experience,1806.504,3.837
"on the ground, why --",1810.341,1.468
Mr. Spicer: But with respect to that --,1811.809,1.569
"The Press: -- with whatever these issues are,",1813.378,1.201
"the foreign policy issues in particular,",1814.579,1.969
that you laid out.,1816.548,1.167
Mr. Spicer: But you just said -- right.,1817.715,1.669
"Can you just be clear, though, because you just",1819.384,1.334
"said, &amp;quot;With years of linguistic experience.&amp;quot;",1820.718,1.202
"So, what situation are you specifically referring to?",1821.92,1.301
The Press: That&amp;#39;s partly why I was asking exactly,1823.221,1.201
what&amp;#39;s in the portfolio.,1824.422,1.101
Because it&amp;#39;s our understanding that,1825.523,1.535
"Mr. Kushner is involved with Mexico, that he&amp;#39;s involved",1827.058,1.635
"with Saudi Arabia, that he&amp;#39;s involved with Canada,",1828.693,2.369
that he&amp;#39;s involved with a number of different issues --,1831.062,2.402
"China, in particular.",1833.464,1.869
"Mr. Spicer: I think that there has been, as he has",1835.333,1.735
"made clear -- initially, during the transition,",1837.068,2.436
he played a very key role in helping facilitate,1839.504,2.369
a lot of those.,1841.873,0.901
But now that his State Department is up,1842.774,1.334
and running he has started to push a lot of those.,1844.108,2.002
But there&amp;#39;s obviously people that are going to continue --,1846.11,1.902
The Press: He&amp;#39;s pushing those to the State Department?,1848.012,1.435
Mr. Spicer: Absolutely.,1849.447,1.001
But there&amp;#39;s a lot of relationships that Jared,1850.448,1.535
has made over time with different leaders --,1851.983,2.102
Mexico being one of them you mentioned -- that are,1854.085,2.503
going to continue to have conversations with him,1856.588,2.068
and help facilitate.,1858.656,0.868
That doesn&amp;#39;t mean by any means that it&amp;#39;s being done,1859.524,2.469
"without coordination with the State Department; quite,",1861.993,2.369
"in fact, the opposite.",1864.362,2.069
He continues to work with them and to facilitate,1866.431,2.335
"an outcome, but he brings a perspective to this",1868.766,3.404
and began doing that during the transition.,1872.17,1.701
"But again, it&amp;#39;s not a binary choice where it&amp;#39;s",1873.871,2.87
-- he&amp;#39;s doing this at the expense of somebody else.,1876.741,2.069
"The Press: So, he has a direct line",1878.81,1.034
"to the President, whereas the other institutions are not.",1879.844,2.002
"Mr. Spicer: Okay, great, that&amp;#39;s even better then.",1881.846,1.268
I think that&amp;#39;s a win for our government.,1883.114,1.668
Shannon.,1884.782,1.202
"The Press: On healthcare, has the President been",1885.984,2.269
"reaching out, or anyone in the administration,",1888.253,1.634
to Democrats in Congress?,1889.887,1.502
Can you say specifically who?,1891.389,2.269
And does he still see the opportunity to work more,1893.658,2.97
closely with Democrats given the difficulties,1896.628,3.436
with the House Freedom Caucus?,1900.064,1.936
Mr. Spicer: I think the President has made clear,1902,2.902
that he intends to work with anyone who wants to,1904.902,3.104
help him get to the number of votes.,1908.006,1.334
He obviously has had a very productive discussion,1909.34,3.003
this weekend with Senator Paul.,1912.343,2.803
"I know the Vice President has been actively engaged,",1915.146,1.935
"as well as other members of the staff, with members",1917.081,2.002
of the House in particular.,1919.083,1.502
And they&amp;#39;re going to continue to try,1920.585,1.735
to find a way forward.,1922.32,1.001
But there are some -- I&amp;#39;m not going to expose every,1923.321,2.469
member that&amp;#39;s had some of these -- some of them will,1925.79,1.635
want to backchannel this to offer solutions,1927.425,4.004
and constructive ways forward.,1931.429,1.068
But those conversations are happening at several,1932.497,3.103
levels within the White House to see if we can,1935.6,1.802
find a way forward to get the number of requisite votes.,1937.402,2.903
But the President continues to work hard.,1940.305,2.969
He&amp;#39;s having these conversations.,1943.274,1.168
Members have reached out to him to make their suggestions known.,1944.442,4.238
And so that&amp;#39;s -- but we continue to feel,1948.68,5.038
optimistic in the sense that there&amp;#39;s a lot of,1953.718,1.969
constructive ideas that are coming to the table,1955.687,2.369
to get us to a way forward on healthcare.,1958.056,2.802
I just want to make one admin announcement.,1960.858,2.87
"Tomorrow, the President is -- as I mentioned,",1963.728,2.869
he&amp;#39;s giving a speech tomorrow with a roundtable of CEOs,1966.597,3.304
on the American workforce.,1969.901,1.134
And then tomorrow he&amp;#39;ll be speaking again,1971.035,2.736
at the American National Building Trades union.,1973.771,1.936
"So, we&amp;#39;ll have some kind of background briefing",1975.707,1.768
before the day because he is speaking live.,1977.475,2.169
"So, we will, on the guidance tomorrow,",1979.644,1.668
have something for you in terms of what we&amp;#39;ll do for a briefing.,1981.312,3.037
We&amp;#39;re working on that now.,1984.349,0.934
"With that, I&amp;#39;m going to end for today and let",1985.283,2.436
you guys have a good one.,1987.719,1.134
Take care.,1988.853,0.667
"Thank you, guys.",1989.52,0.401
